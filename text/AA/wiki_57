Mataura Island

Mataura Island is a farming community in Southland, New Zealand. It is located close to the east bank of the lower reaches of the Mataura River. Despite its name, it is no longer an island. Mataura Island is located some east of the region's main city of Invercargill, and south of the town of Edendale, on the Awarua Plains and close to the western edge of The Catlins.
At the time of first settlement in the mid 19th century, the Mataura River flowed to the east of the locality. Early settler Thomas Ayson extended a creek which ran to the west into an irrigation channel linking with the Mataura at both ends. Flooding in 1878 resulted in the Mataura River diverting down the channel and scouring a new bed, and the locality became a genuine island, with parts of the river flowing on either side of it. The old course of the river has now been blocked by stopbanks at the northern (upstream) end.
Today, Mataura Island is a small, dairy and sheep farming community. Until the 1990s, it was the site of a school (Mataura Island School), which had operated since 1890, and a Presbyterian church, which was established in 1900. Both of these are now gone, as is the former cheese and dairy factory, which operated from the 1890s until the 1970s.

Food and biological process engineering

Food and biological process engineering is a discipline concerned with applying principles of engineering to the fields of food production and distribution and biology. It is a broad field, with workers fulfilling a variety of roles ranging from design of food processing equipment to genetic modification of organisms. In some respects it is a combined field, drawing from the disciplines of food science and biological engineering to improve the earth's food supply.
Creating, processing, and storing food to support the world's population requires extensive interdisciplinary knowledge. Notably, there are many biological engineering processes within food engineering to manipulate the multitude of organisms involved in our complex food chain. Food safety in particular requires biological study to understand the microorganisms involved and how they affect humans. However, other aspects of food engineering, such as food storage and processing, also require extensive biological knowledge of both the food and the microorganisms that inhabit it. This food microbiology and biology knowledge becomes biological engineering when systems and processes are created to maintain desirable food properties and microorganisms while providing mechanisms for eliminating the unfavorable or dangerous ones.
Concepts.
Many different concepts are involved in the field of food and biological process engineering. Below are listed several major ones.
Food science.
The science behind food and food production involves studying how food behaves and how it can be improved. Researchers analyze longevity and composition (i.e., ingredients, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of foods, as well as how to ensure food safety.
Genetic engineering#food production....
Modern food and biological process engineering relies heavily on applications of genetic manipulation. By understanding plants and animals on the molecular level, scientists are able to engineer them with specific goals in mind.
Among the most notable applications of such genetic engineering is the creation of disease or insect resistant plants, such as those modified to produce Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that kills strain-specific varieties of insect upon consumption. However, insects are able to adapt to Bacillus thuringiensis strains, necessitating continued research to maintain disease-resistance.
Food safety.
An important task within the realm of food safety is the elimination of microorganisms responsible for food-borne illness. Food and waterborne diseases still pose a serious health concern, with hundreds of outbreaks reported per year since 1971 in the United States alone. The risk of these diseases has risen throughout the years, mainly due to the mishandling of raw food, poor sanitation, and poor socioeconomic conditions. In addition to diseases caused by direct infection by pathogens, some food borne diseases are caused by the presence of toxins produced by microorganisms in food. There are five main types of microbial pathogens which contaminate food and water: viruses, bacteria, fungi, pathogenic protozoa and helminths.
Several bacteria, such as E. coli, Clostridium botulinum, and Salmonella enterica, are well-known and are targeted for elimination via various industrial processes. Though bacteria are often the focus of food safety processes, viruses, protozoa, and molds are also known to cause food-borne illness and are of concern when designing processes to ensure food safety. Although the goal of food safety is to eliminate harmful organisms from food and prevent food-borne illness, detecting said organisms is another important function of food safety mechanisms.
Monitoring and detection.
The goal of most monitoring and detection processes is the rapid detection of harmful microorganisms with minimal interruption to the processing of food products. An example of a detection mechanism that relies heavily on biological processes is usage of chromogenic microbiological media.
Chromogenic Microbiological Media.
Chromogenic microbiological media use colored enzymes to detect the presence of certain bacteria. In conventional bacteria culturing, bacteria are allowed to grow on a medium that supports many strains. Since it is hard to isolate bacteria, many cultures of different bacteria are able to form. To identify a particular bacteria culture, scientists must identify it using only its physical characteristics. Then further tests can be performed to confirm the presence of the bacteria, such as serology tests that find antibodies formed in organisms as a response to infection. In contrast, chromogenic microbiological media use particular color-producing enzymes that are targeted for metabolism by a certain strain of bacteria. Thus, if the given cultures are present, the media will become colored accordingly as the bacteria metabolize the color-producing enzyme. This greatly facilitates the identification of certain bacteria cultures and can eliminate need for further testing. To guard against misidentification of bacteria, the chromogenic plates typically incorporate additional enzymes that will be processed by other bacteria. Now, as the non-target bacteria interact with the additional enzymes, they will produce colors that distinguish them from the target bacteria.
Mechanisms.
Food safety has been practiced for thousands of years, but with the rise of heavily industrial agriculture, the demand for food safety has steadily increased, prompting more research into the ways to achieve greater food safety. A primary mechanism that will be discussed in this article is heating of food products to kill microorganisms, as this has a millennia-long history and is still extensively used. However, more recent mechanisms have been created such as application of ultraviolet light, high pressure, electric field, cold plasma, usage of ozone, and irradiation of food.
Heating.
A report given to the Food and Drug Administration by the Institute of Food Technologists thoroughly discusses the thermal processing of food. A notable step in development of heat application to food processing is pasteurization, developed by Louis Pasteur in the nineteenth century. Pasteurization is used to kill microorganisms that could pose risks to consumers or shorten the shelf life of food products. Primarily applied to liquid food products, pasteurization is regularly applied to fruit juice, beer, milk, and ice cream. Heat applied during pasteurization varies from around 60 °C to kill bacteria to around 80 °C to kill yeasts. Most pasteurization processes have been optimized recently to involve several steps of heating at various temperatures and minimize the time needed for the process. A more severe food heating mechanism is thermal sterilization. While pasteurization destroys most bacteria and yeast growing in food products, the goal of sterilization is to kill almost all viable organisms found in food products including yeast, mold, bacteria, and spore forming organisms. Done properly, this process will greatly extend the shelf life of food products and can allow them to be stored at room temperature. As detailed in The Handbook of Food Preservation, thermal sterilization typically involves four steps. First, food products are heated to between 110-125 °C, and the products are given time for the heat to travel through the material completely. After this, the temperature must be maintained long enough to kill microorganisms before the food product is cooled to prevent cooking. In practice, though complete sterility of food products could be achieved, the intense and extended heating needed to accomplish this could reduce the nutritive value of the food products, thus, only a partial sterilization is performed.
Low-Temperature Process.
Low-temperature processing also plays an essential role in food processing and storage. During this process, microorganisms and enzymes are subjected to low temperatures. Unlike heating, chilling does not destroy the enzymes and microorganisms but simply reduces their activity, which is effective as long as the temperature is maintained. As the temperature is raised, activity will rise again accordingly. It follows that, unlike heating, the effect of preservation by cold is not permanent; hence the importance of maintaining the "cold chain" throughout the shelf life of the food product. (Chapter 16 pg, 396) 
It is important to note that there are two distinct low temperature processes: chilling and freezing. Chilling is the application of temperatures within the range of 0-8 °C, while freezing is usually below 18 °C. Refrigeration does slow spoilage in food and reduce the risk of bacterial growth, however, it does not improve the quality of the product.
Irradiation.
Food irradiation is another notable biological engineering process to achieve food safety. Research into the potential utilization of ionizing irradiation for food preservation started in the 1940s as an extension of studies on the effect of radiation on living cells. The FDA approved usage of ionizing radiation on food products in 1990. This radiation removes electrons from atoms, and these electrons go on to damage the DNA of microorganisms living in the food, killing the microorganisms. Irradiation can be used to pasteurize food products, such as seafood, poultry, and red meat, thus making these food products safer for consumers. Some irradiation is also used to delay fruit ripening processes, which can kill microorganisms that accelerate the ripening and spoilage of produce. Low dosages of radiation can also be used to kill insects living in harvested crops, as the radiation will stunt the insects' development at various stages and damage their ability to reproduce.
Food storage and preservation.
Food storage and preservation is a key component of food engineering processes and relies heavily on biological engineering to understand and manipulate the organisms involved. Note that the above food safety processes such as pasteurization and sterilization destroy the microorganisms that also contribute to deterioration of food products while not necessarily posing a risk to people. Understanding of these processes, their effects, and the microorganisms at play in various food processing techniques is a very important biological engineering task within food engineering. Factories and processes must be created to ensure that food products can be processed in an efficient and effective manner, which again relies heavily on biological engineering expertise.
Produce.
Preservation and processing of fresh produce poses many biological engineering challenges. Understanding of biology is particularly important to processing produce because most fruits and vegetables are living organisms from the time of harvest to the time of consumption. Before harvesting, understanding of plant ontogeny, or origin and development, and the manipulation of these developmental processes are key components of the industrial agriculture process. Understanding of plant developmental cycles governs how and when plants are harvested, impacts storage environments, and contributes to creating intervention processes. Even after harvesting, fruits and vegetables undergo the biological processes of respiration, transpiration, and ripening. Control over these natural plant processes should be achieved to prevent food spoilage, sprouting or growth of produce during storage, and reduction in quality or desirability, such as through wilting or loss of desirable texture.
Technology.
When considering food storage and preservation, the technologies of modified atmosphere and controlled atmosphere are widely used for the storage and packing of several types of foods. They offer several advantages such as delay of ripening and senescence of horticultural commodities, control of some biological processes such as rancidity, insects, bacteria and decay, among others. Controlled atmosphere (CA) storage refers to atmospheres that are different than normal air and strictly controlled at all times. This type of storage manipulates the CO2 and O2 levels within airtight stores of containers. Modified atmosphere (MA) storage refers to any atmosphere different from normal air, typically made by mixing CO2, O2, and N2.
Waste management.
Another biological engineering process within food engineering involves the processing of agricultural waste. Though it may fall more within the realm of environmental engineering, understanding how organisms in the environment will respond to the waste products is important for assessing the impact of the processes and comparing waste processing strategies. It is also important to understand which organisms are involved in the decomposition of the waste products, and the byproducts that will be produced as a result of their activity.
To discuss direct application of biological engineering, biological waste processing techniques are used to process organic waste and sometimes create useful byproducts. There are two main processes by which organic matter is processed via microbes: aerobic processes and anaerobic processes. These processes convert organic matter to cell mass through synthesis processes of microorganisms. Aerobic processes occur in the presence of oxygen, take organic matter as input, and produce water, carbon dioxide, nitrate, and new cell mass. Anaerobic processes occur in the absence of oxygen and produce less cell mass than aerobic processes. An additional benefit of anaerobic processes is that they also generate methane, which can be burned as a fuel source. Design of both aerobic and anaerobic biological waste processing plants requires careful control of temperature, humidity, oxygen concentration, and the waste products involved. Understanding of all aspects of the system and how they interact with one another is important for developing efficient waste management plants and falls within the realm of biological engineering.

Liu Zhibai

Born in 1915 in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, China, Liu Zhibai is one of the most innovative masters in modern Chinese ink painting. Liu Zhibai studied in Suzhou in 1933, in China's best Art school at the time: the Suzhou Fine Arts College (this school had exhibited in the 1920s more than 500 famous plaster sculptures, and brought from France nearly ten thousand albums of Western art).
He studied under Mr. Gu Yanping, director of the Chinese painting department of Suzhou Fine Arts College. The Gu family is a large family of well-known Chinese collectors. The "Guoyun Pavilion" established by this family has been collecting the works of many great artists in the history of Chinese art for nearly a century, dating from the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty. Starting from 1935, Liu Zhibai lived for a long time at the Guoyun Pavilion. There he studied and explored, under Professor Gu Yanping's guidance, the works of the great Chinese painters and learned ancient art history. During the Second World War, Japan invaded China. Liu Zhibai then embarked on a journey of exile that lasted eight years. He finally returned to his home county of Fengyang in 1946 to teach art in a college. In 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, Liu Zhibai fled the war and traveled to Guangxi Province. In December of the same year, he proposed his first theory of painting, "External Learning Focused on the Ego", in Quanzhou County, birth country of Shi Tao, a great Chinese painter.
Throughout his 50 years of artistic creation, Liu Zhibai has studied all the landscapes of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau while continuing to nurture his passion for ancient Chinese art. The artist, who has always been independent and meticulously explored the journey to artistic creation, finally reached the peak of his own artistic creation towards the end of his life. He created a new artistic style, different from the Millennium ink painting of Chinese art, expressing his choice of lifestyle and artistic expression, breaking from secular society. Because of his unique and self-artistic expression, Liu Zhibai wasn't recognized by the Chinese artistic community until his death. Fifteen years after his death, his explorations of art with Chinese ink and his great contribution to the artistic mind have come to be more and more appreciated. Art historians discovered him and devoted research trials to him. The first historian claimed that the roots of Zhibai's art strongly owed to the Song and Yuan dynasties, to which was added a hint of the artistic style of the Ming and Qing dynasties. He affirmed that the artist had been inspired by both the essence of traditional Chinese arts and the innovation of artistic language. His 60 years of careful study of ancient art techniques and the pursuit of artistic and coherent innovation have helped him to create new ink painting techniques with which he unveiled Chinese landscapes only from the age of 80.
Liu Zhibai became the last guardian of Chinese painting and a pioneer of innovation in the new century: the art of ink painting, which he fathered in the last years of his life, marked a turning point between Chinese tradition and modernity. It puts forth the historical trend of abstract art and the performance of Chinese ink painting in the 21st century. After Liu Zhibai's death, a number of publishing houses have released a total of 15 monographs and over 20 research journals with titles such as "Book of Famous Artists of Modern and Contemporary Chinese Paintings - Liu Zhibai", "Book of Paintings by Liu Zhibai", "Qian Mountain Characters - Liu Zhibai's Art", "Freshness of Painting, Ink Traces and Poetic Drunkenness - Ink Landscape Paintings", "Defending Black by Appreciating White - The Art of Liu Zhibai". More than 90 of his works are now part of collections owned by multiple art institutions, including the National Art Museum of China, the National Chinese Academy of Painting, the Guizhou Provincial Museum, the Provincial Institute of History and Guizhou Culture, Anhui Provincial Museum of History and Culture, and Anhui Provincial Museum of Art.
Artistic Background.
In the early 1970s, Liu Zhibai lived in a mountain village near the Xima River in Longli County, Guizhou Province. In the late 1970s, he began a new period of artistic creation, which has for main theme the landscape of the Qian Mountain, painted in ink. In 1984, the Guizhou Provincial Museum collected four pieces of landscape paintings and a piece of flower painting.
Social Assessment.
In "Investment Value Analysis of 30 Contemporary Chinese Painters", Liu Zhibai was named one of the 30 Most Academic and Most Valued Painters of the Contemporary Age, including Master Wu Guanzhong.
Mr. Feng Qiyong, former vice president and scholar of the China Academy of Arts, amazed by Mr. Liu Zhibai's paintaings, volunteered to write a preface to the compilation of his paintings. His appreciation of Liu Zhibai's art is evident in the following quote: "Liu Lao's painting embodies authentic Chinese style and unique Chinese charm. We know how rich is the Chinese artistic tradition, particularly the pictorial tradition, and how much pictorial arts develop under the brush of the literati. Under Liu Zhibai’s brush, the semantic fields remains diverse, no term predominates. Since the origins of landscape painting, Master Liu's paintings show or exceed the charm of Shi Tao and Shi Xi. The landscapes he depicts seem born from the real mountains and rivers of Guizhou, sparkling with natural freshness. His works reveal the greatest enjoyment of nature – there is not the slightest feeling of obsolescence remains, on the contrary, every single detail is refreshing. We find the authentic charm of the real water of Guizhou! To me, Liu's painting was personalized, and he found himself confused with the world, including landscapes and their natural environment. He knew how to reach the ideal state pursued by all painters! "
For Chen Lvsheng, a famous Chinese literary critic, Liu Zhibai's paintings reveal a wild temperament. His works show not only the ups and downs of his life, but also the changing and indefinable life chapters, as well as his wild artistic style, created by his accommodating lifestyle philosophy.

Baddega I

Baddega (r. c. 850-895 CE), who assumed the title Solada-gaṇḍa, was an Indian ruler from the Vemulavada Chalukya dynasty. He was a vassal of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna II, and participated in Krishna's unsuccessful invasions of the Vengi Chalukya kingdom.
Reign.
Baddega was a son of his predecessor Yuddhamalla II, and served as a vassal of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna II. He is said to have fought 42 battles, and acquired the title "Solada-gaṇḍa" ("the unvanquished hero").
The Vemulavada Chalukyas were old rivals of the Vengi Chalukyas, and had participated in Rashtrakuta campaigns against them. The Vengi Chalukya ruler Gunaga Vijayaditya III inflicted a humiliating defeat on Krishna. According to the Vengi Chalukya inscriptions, Vijayaditya captured Baddega, and offered him protection.
After Vijayaditya's death in 892, the succession of the next king Bhima I was contested by some rebels. Taking advantage of this, Krishna invaded Vengi once again, and captured the frontier region administered by the Ranamardadaka family. However, he was forced to retreat by the Vengi general Kusuma-yudha. This is attested by the Kuravi (or Koravi) inscription of Kusuma-yudha's subordinate Peddana. Krishna appears to have launched another invasion of Vengi, as attested by Bhima's Vedataluru grant inscription. This time, the Rashtrakuta army led by Gundyana penetrated deeper into the Vengi Chalukya kingdom, before being forced to retreat.
Baddega appears to have participated in both of Krishna's campaigns against Bhima. According to his family's Parbhani inscription and the court poet Pampa, he captured Bhima as if "he seized a crocodile in water." The simile suggests that Baddega captured Bhima in his natural environment, that is, within the Vengi kingdom, possibly in the capital. Therefore, this event probably happened during the second Rashtrakuta invasion of Vengi, when the invaders penetrated deeper into the kingdom. Bhima appears to have escaped the captivity in a short time, and continued to rule Vengi. His son Iramarti Ganda defeated the Rashtrakuta forces at Peruvanguru and Niravadyapura. Both Iramarti and the Rashtrakuta general Gundyana were killed in this war.
Nothing is known about Bhima's other military achievements. He appears to have died around 895, and was succeeded by his son Yuddhamalla III.
Cultural contributions.
An inscription of Baddega's descendant Arisimha II mentions the Baddegeshvara ("Ishvara of Baddega") temple; the name suggests that it was built by Baddega. This temple is identified with the modern Bheemeshvara temple at Vemulavada.

Nils Tjoflot

Nils Ellingsson Tjoflot (October 13, 1865 – July 11, 1898) was a Norwegian violinist from Tjoflot in the municipality of Ullensvang in Norway's Hardanger district.
Life.
Tjoflot was born at the Ytrabødn farm in Tjoflot, the son of Elling Nilsson Tjoflot (1819–1870) and Barbro Endresdatter Folkedal from Trones (1837–1905). Nils was an only child, and his father died when he was five years old. There had not been any previous violinists in the family, but there were many violinists in Tjoflot and Nils was motivated to perform alongside them. He received a violin from his mother when he was seven years old. The instrument was probably made by Hans Eikanes, and it was probably Eikanes that also taught Tjoflot to play the Hardanger fiddle. Tjoflot was later taught by Olav Håstabø from Løflaten in Kvanndal, and then by Ola Mosafinn.
Nils Tjoflot was a talented player that was known throughout Hardanger and participated in folk music competitions held by the Western Norwegian Association (); the first such competition was held in 1896, and the second in 1897. Tjoflot often played for dances at weddings and at other events around the Hardanger Fjord. He played at his first wedding at the age of 10, and he also played for tourists visiting the Hardanger Fjord. The folklorist Rikard Berge mentioned Nils Tjoflot as one of the most talented folk musicians in Hardanger in his article "Spelemenner" (Folk Musicians).
Together with several other folk musicians from the area, Tjoflot was a member of the Western Norwegian Association.
Death.
Tjoflot died in a shipwreck in 1898 when he was only 32 years old. On Sunday, July 10, 1898, he traveled with his custom-built sailboat to Granvin. He was frequently in Granvin, where he had many friends and acquaintances from his confirmation, including many that played fiddle. Both Severin Kjerland and Nils Nilsson Eida were admirers of Nils. This Sunday there were two men with him in the boat, Endre Sjurson Kvammen and Jon Tjoflot. In Granvin, Nils Tjoflot played at a barn dance, and the dance lasted until late in the night.
It was already morning when the three had to travel back on the sailboat to Tjoflot. Nils sat in the bow with his fiddle and Endre was at the helm. Nils is reported to have stated, "We're sailing under the Norwegian flag." He played the folk dance tune "Blåmannen," which he had learned from Håstabø. Soon they were far out in the fjord, and the music could no longer heard by those on the land. Suddenly, they turned against the wind so that the boat was sailing close-hauled near Røynstrand. The boat went over and took on water. It had heavy ballast, stone covered with a latticework, and it sank in the blink of an eye. It all happened so fast that no one on land fully understood what had happened. People quickly rowed out to the scene, but there was nothing to see when they arrived. Soon afterward, Nils's fiddle and hat floated up, and that was all. This caused much sadness because Nils was a popular man known for his hard work, artistic sense, and forthrightness.
Tjoflot's fiddles.
Tjoflot owned several fiddles in his work as a folk musician. He also made his own Hardanger fiddles, and at one time he owned a Samnanger fiddle. The article "Felene hans Nils Tjoflot" (Nils Tjoflot's Fiddles) is dedicated to Tjoflot's instruments.
The fiddle that floated to the surface after Tjoflot drowned on the morning of June 11, 1898 was repaired by the violin maker Knut Eilevsson Steintjønndalen, who had also made the instrument. The fiddle was restored to its original condition, but perhaps not as good as when it was owned by Tjoflot, who considered it a top-quality instrument. The fiddle is now displayed at the Hardanger Folk Museum in Utne, which lies across the Hardanger Fjord from the village of Tjoflot.
Musical work.
Tjoflot composed Hardanger fiddle pieces ("slåtter"), schottisches, waltzes, and other pieces. He was especially fond of playing pieces for turning dances ("runddans"). He established his own Tjoflot version of tunes for turning dances. Tjoflot had a distinctive style of playing and way of performing material that was well-liked by people. He also taught several folk musicians in Hardanger, and he taught them the Hardanger fiddle pieces that he had learned from others as well as his own compositions.
Tjoflot's Hardanger fiddle pieces and waltzes are also performed today, and recordings of them have been played on the folk music program on Norwegian radio. About 20 waltzes are known based on the work of Nils Tjoflot. Many of these waltzes were recorded by the folk musician Anders S. Kjerland from Granvin.
In 2008, the diatonic button accordion player Rannveig Djønne released a CD called "Spelferd heim – slåtter frå Hardanger og Voss på durspel" (Spelferd Heim: Tunes from Hardanger and Voss for Button Accordion) on which she performs three pieces by Nils Tjoflot: "Hamborgar etter Nils Tjoflot" (Hamburg Melody by Nils Tjoflot), "Reinlender etter Nils Tjoflot" (Rhineland Melody by Nils Tjoflot), and the well-known "Ginavalsen" (Gina Waltz), which he wrote in heartbreak when he learned that the girl he loved had become engaged to another.

Kamalini Mukherji

Kamalini Mukherji (born 17 October 1979) is an Indian vocalist, primarily known for her Rabindra Sangeet performances.
Mukherji has released 12 music albums with HMV Saregama, one of the leading music labels in India. As of 2018, she has performed concerts in India, the USA, Canada, and Bangladesh. She has also performed for film and television. Mukherji currently lives in and works out of San Francisco, USA and Kolkata, India.
Early life.
Born into a Bengali family, Mukherji grew up in Kolkata, India where she studied at South Point School. She received her musical training at Dakshinee, a prominent Rabindra Sangeet academy in Kolkata, and obtained a degree in English literature from Jadavpur University, where she also won a Gates Cambridge Scholarship. She pursued post graduate studies in English literature from St. John’s College in the UK and Collegio Ghislieri, at the University of Pavia, Italy.
Career.
Mukherji performed her debut solo concert in Kolkata in September, 2009. She has since performed extensively in India and abroad, including at the North American Bengali Conferences on three occasions – in 2012 (Las Vegas), 2013 (Toronto), and 2016 (New York City).
Mukherji has attempted to introduce innovation to her Rabindra Sangeet performances. In 2011, she performed a concert titled "Nutan Juger Bhore" (English:"The Dawning of a New Era"), accompanied by an 11-piece orchestra, which is unusual for the genre.
In 2012 Mukherji sang for a music album "Romancing Tagore", that was a collaborative effort between Indian and Pakistani artists, Shubha Mudgal, Najam Sheraz, Debojyoti Mishra, and Indira Varma to present Tagore’s songs in Urdu. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh released the album in February 2012.
In April 2012, Mukherji visited Mauritius as part of a joint initiative between UNESCO and the Ministry of Culture of the Government of Mauritius on the occasion of Rabindranath Tagore's 150th birth anniversary. The purpose of the trip was to introduce the musical work of Tagore to school children in that country.
In 2015, Mukherji presented a solo concert for the President of India, to celebrate the 154th Birth Anniversary of Tagore, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi.
Film and Television.
Mukherji was a regular guest on a weekly music show "Chirantani" (), that aired on Tara Muzik from 2008 to 2011. She also hosted her own show "Café Thé Live", a live music program and talk show, on the same channel.
She also performed as a playback singer for the 2005 movie "Nishijapon" (), directed by Sandip Ray.
Discography.
Mukherji’s first individual Rabindra Sangeet music album, "Eshechho Prem" () was released by HMV Saregama in 2010, which was followed by 7 more albums with the same label. In 2016 HMV Saregama released a compilation album "Best of Kamalini Mukherjee".
Reviews.
Mukherji has been critically appreciated both for her rendition of traditional Rabindra Sangeet as well as for her more interpretative work in the genre.
Reviewing one of her earliest concerts, organized by Dakshinee in May 2006, "The Telegraph" wrote:Recital of the day came from Kamalini Mukhopadhyay. Here is one young soprano who has lived up to the great expectations of early years. Her "Ki ragini bajale" () came at the end of the Prem segment. Soaked in the ambiguous melancholy of Kanada, she embellished the number with undulating glides alternating with brisk melodic phrases.In September 2007, "The Telegraph" praised her performance at another Dakshinee concert, writing "Yet a musical and humane understanding of the whole life and shape of a song came unmistakably through in the controlled devastation of Kamalini Mukherjee’s "Tori amar hothat dubey jai" ()".
Mukherji’s 2009 debut solo concert was also positively reviewed. "The Telegraph" wrote: [T]he most remarkable element of her "gayaki" is the precise and powerful scansion — never an inadvertent splitting of a word, or a breather in the wrong place —- that puts her in the tiny club of cerebral Rabindrasangeet singers.Reviewing the same concert, "The Statesman" wrote "Kamalini Mukherji holds in her singing a promise to succeed in popularizing Rabindranath Tagore’s song among the present generation", while "Anandabazar Patrika" praised her arrangement of Tagore’s Devotional Songs and Love Songs, and the way that she was able to draw out diverse moods such as happiness, wonderment, separation, and earnestness.
In November 2010, "The Telegraph" reviewed her experimental concert "Nutan juger bhore" (নূতন যুগের ভোরে), Thanks to Mukherji’s powerful singing that never allowed a note to waver or an emotional resonance to overstep its suggestion, the music remained as embellishment and never took an iota away from her performance.However, "The Statesman" was critical of the "excess of external support", and commented:[T]he passion that went into her singing may have raised questions on whether there was any need to think about external aids to support the musical tastes of the band era.

Leprechaun Returns

Leprechaun Returns is a 2018 American comedy horror film made as a direct sequel to "Leprechaun" from 1993. Directed by Astron-6's Steven Kostanski, the film stars Taylor Spreitler as the daughter of Jennifer Aniston's character from the original film, who encounters the titular creature 25 years after her mother trapped it in a well. Warwick Davis elected not to return as the Leprechaun, and Linden Porco took over the role for this film.
Plot.
Lila Jenkins (Taylor Spreitler) arrives at Devil's Lake, North Dakota, to help greenify an old house owned by her sorority at Laramore University. Lila hitches a ride from Ozzie Jones (Mark Holton) and reveals that her mother, Tory Redding, had died the year prior to cancer. Ozzie accidentally drops his phone while unloading Lila's luggage and heads back to retrieve it, only to get sprayed by water from the old well, rebirthing the Leprechaun and causing it to punch his way out of Ozzie's torso. 
Lila meets her sorority sisters consisting of Katie (Pepi Sonuga), an eco-friendly and intelligent girl; Rose (Sai Bennett), the self-appointed leader of the group; and Meredith (Emily Reid), a stoner who brings over a group of dudes consisting of Andy (Ben McGregor), a dimwitted student attracted to Katie; and Matt (Oliver Llewellyn Jenkins), a self-proclaimed wannabe filmmaker. After Meredith insults Lila's mother for her fear of monsters, Lila goes to bed and encounters visions of Zombie Ozzie. The next morning, Katie and Andy install a solar panel, while the Leprechaun learns that his powers are too weak due to his loss of gold, and determines that killing will solve his problems. That night, the Leprechaun reveals himself to Lila and Meredith, who takes pictorial evidence of the creature when Matt and Rose rebuff their suspicions. Andy also encounters the Leprechaun, who bifurcates him in half with the solar panel after he mocks the leprechaun for his height.
Meredith and Lila sneak inside the house to recover the car keys, where Meredith locks Lila in the basement and reveals she made a deal with the leprechaun to have Lila in hopes of leaving the rest alone. The group leaves Lila behind when Meredith reveals that Lila was killed, but soon learn of Meredith's true intentions. Meanwhile, Lila encounters Ghost Ozzie, who helps Lila learn of the Leprechaun's true weakness and of the basement's exit hole. When the Leprechaun catches up to the group on Matt's drone, they crash into a tree and run away, leaving Meredith behind when the Leprechaun reveals a loophole he created in order to continue the murders. The Leprechaun slows Meredith down using sprinklers, and kills her by impaling her mouth with sprinkler faucet. Matt attempts to slow down the Leprechaun with his drone, but he overrides the controls and decapitates Matt with the drone blades. 
Rose and Katie run into Lila and follow a treasure map that Ghost Ozzie helped Lila discover. The three discover a pick-up truck that contains the gold, but Rose reveals that she cashed in some of the gold to help finance the greenify project. To deceive the leprechaun, Lila stuffs the pot with tampons and offers the gold back to the Leprechaun, but he realizes their true intentions. Lila is able to trap the leprechaun in a circle of iron objects (iron is a leprechaun's weakness) in order create a plan to defeat the leprechaun. Katie restores the power while Rose creates clover juice. Lila stuffs a hose in the Leprechaun's mouth and fill him with the juice, causing him to explode. Rose offers to clean the house, but the Leprechaun is able to multiply himself into multiple small leprechauns using chunks of his body. Rose is able to defeat most of the creatures, but the leprechauns outsmart her and impale her on a trophy. The leprechaun is able to form again before Lila and Katie discover Rose's body. 
Lila is able to surround the leprechaun's feet with gold before electrocuting the Leprechaun, blowing up the house in the process. Lila and Katie become covered in green slime and they escape. It's revealed Lubdan survived at the end. He hitchhikes a ride on a chicken truck on its way to Bismarck, North Dakota so he can reclaim his gold before the credits roll.

Scott Foster (ice hockey)

Scott Foster (born January 17, 1982) is a Canadian accountant and amateur ice hockey player. He appeared in one game for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) near the end of the 2017–18 season as an emergency goaltender following injuries to the team's starting and backup goaltenders, becoming the first emergency goaltender to be called into a game due to injuries in recent years.
Playing career.
College.
Foster played junior hockey with the Petrolia Jets of the Western Ontario Hockey League in the 2001–02 season. He then moved on to play for Western Michigan University's hockey team in the 2002–03, 2003–04, and 2005–06 Central Collegiate Hockey Association seasons. He played in tandem with Mike Mantua in 2002–03, playing 21 games to Mantua's 26 and recording a 7–8–2 record with a .868 save percentage. His next year was more successful as he served as the team's starting goaltender, playing 33 games and recording an .881 percentage. His final stint with the team was less successful, as he played just one game in 2005-06, allowing three goals on seven shots in just one period of play.
Chicago Blackhawks.
Foster was signed by the Chicago Blackhawks to an amateur tryout contract on the eve of their March 29, 2018, game against the Winnipeg Jets when the presumed starter Anton Forsberg was sidelined by injury. Forsberg himself had become the Blackhawks starting goaltender after Corey Crawford suffered a season-ending concussion. Foster had gone to 15 games as an emergency goaltender prior to this game, but never dressed. Serving as the Blackhawks' emergency backup goaltender for the game, Foster was not expected to play, considering his lack of high-level experience and the fact that only one goaltender of his kind had suited up for NHL action in recent years: Jorge Alves, who made his seven-second Carolina Hurricanes debut at the end of a game in December 2016.
However, before the mid-way mark of the third period, Blackhawks starter Collin Delia, who was also making his NHL debut that night, was injured, forcing Foster into NHL action for his debut. He saved seven shots out of seven in about 14 minutes of play, becoming the first emergency goaltender to ever stop a shot, and preserving a 6–2 Blackhawks' win. Although Delia was credited with the win, Foster was named the game's first star. Asked about his performance following his NHL debut, Foster quipped, "I think I'm just hitting my prime." Assuming Foster does not play again in the NHL, he is one of 18 players since 1982 to record a perfect 1.000 save percentage in the league.
For the game Foster received "Just beer league glory", he said. He kept his game-worn jersey but no other compensation; under the terms of the NHL collective bargaining agreement, players signed to amateur tryout contracts like Foster are unpaid for their services.
Foster appeared at the 2018 NHL Award Ceremony, where he and Jim Belushi presented the Vezina Trophy to Pekka Rinne. Previously, he was voted the "Best NHL First" at the Blackhawks Fan Choice Awards.
During the 2018–19 season, Foster was asked to be an occasional second goalie for the Blackhawks optional morning skate.
Personal life.
Foster lives in Oak Park, Illinois, and works as an accountant with Golub Capital. He was previously with Aurora Investment Management. He plays for two beer league hockey teams as a goaltender. After his turn in the NHL, the United States Hockey League’s Chicago Steel offered to hire him as their "emergency accountant" and hoped to host him at their final home game to conduct the ceremonial puck drop. Foster declined further interviews the next months, preferring to "prioritize his family and work following his NHL stint", even as interview requests came from as far away as Turkey. He agreed to be interviewed by ESPN in April 2019.

George Phillip Stevens

George Phillip Stevens (24 June 1861 – 20 November 1941) was a senior public servant, transitioning from the State Post and Telegraph Department to the Federal Department following Federation. In later years he was secretary of the State Civil Service Association. But he was best known for having conducted the earliest wireless experiments in the State of Western Australia.
Early life and family.
Stevens was born 24 June 1861 at Keynsham, Somerset, England and was the youngest of a family who arrived in Western Australia on 5 August 1868 on board the Palestine. Stevens married Ann Elizabeth Graham (born 8 June 1863) on 23 December 1884 at South Australia. They had three sons and five daughters.
Professional career.
At the age of 13 years he entered the telegraph service as a messenger at Toodyay. Twenty years of Mr. Stevens's life were passed on the south coast as telegraph stationmaster at Bremer Bay, Israelite Bay and Eucla. From the latter station he controlled the traffic during the boom days of the goldfields. From there he was recalled to Perth in 1896 to assume the management of the telegraph department from the central office, and after its transfer to the Commonwealth service in 1901 he was appointed electrical engineer. He retired from the service in 1906. In 1908 Mr. Stevens became secretary of the Civil Service Association, and held the position until he retired in November, 1932.
Wireless experiments.
George Phillip Stevens Western Australia, was slow to engage in wireless telegraphy experiments, but there was public outcry in response to a number of marine disasters on the Western Australian coast in 1898. A need for communication between the Rottnest Island lighthouse and Fremantle Port (16 miles) was identified. In January 1899, W. J. Hancock (Government electrician) suggested that wireless telegraphy could be employed for the task at much lower cost than submarine cable and noted that greater distances had already been achieved in England. In May 1899, George Phillip Stevens (Manager and Electrician, General Post-office) announced that preliminary tests had just been completed in a workshop environment and provided a comprehensive description of the equipment which was described as simple. Two further marine disasters of the W.A. coast in July 1899, forced the Government to act immediately and an order for submarine cables was placed. Nevertheless, wireless experiments continued. Various difficulties were encountered in extending transmission distance, but in September 1899, Stevens announced that reliable transmissions were now being achieved across 5 rooms in the basement of the Telegraph Office. It was further announced that attempts would now be made between the General Post-office, Perth and the Windsor Hotel, South Perth (about 1 mile). In October 1899, successful tests were conducted between the Perth Yacht Club and a police launch, out to a distance of 3/4 mile. Stevens was limited by local workshop facilities and his coherer was not able to be evacuated, resulting in loss of sensitivity. He recommended acquisition of Marconi apparatus, but this in turn led to excessive establishment costs and experiments ceased at this point. The submarine cable between Rottnest Island and the mainland was officially opened in March 1900. Stevens continued to promote wireless telegraphy through public education activities, including practical demonstrations. As part of the Federal Government proposals in 1906, Stevens made enquiries of the Fremantle Harbour Trust as to their attitude to establishment of a station on Rottnest Island, which was supported.
Personal life.
Stevens was a member of the Claremont Municipal Council for upwards of a quarter of a century, and held the office of Mayor during the four years of the 1914-18 war. During World War I he initiated the Battalion Comforts Committee, was vice-president of the State Recruiting Committee and was an active member of the first Soldiers' Welcome Committee. He devoted a considerable amount of time to Freemasonry, and formerly was one of the foremost bowlers in the State. He was a member of the Claremont Bowling Club. Mr. Stevens was a member of the Western Australian Historical Society.
Late life and legacy.
Mr. George Philip Stevens, formerly an official of the Postmaster General's Department and later secretary of the State Civil Service Association, died at his home Wadella, Stirling Highway, Claremont, yesterday. He was aged 80 years.

Beni (music)

Deriving from English 'band', Beni is a popular wedding entertainment with a strong focus on rhythm and dance, and audience participation. Commonly, Zanzibar is recognized as place of origin around the turn of the 20th century as a mockery of colonial style military bands. 
Beni appropriated symbols of colonial authority as the military drill, uniform, and elaborate hierarchies. 
History.
Beni has its origins in urban Swahili communities on the Kenyan coast in the 1890s. Around 1914, the style spread to Tanga and Dar es Sallam. During the First World War, beni was danced in both armies. First accounts of beni in Nyasaland were around 1918. Prisoners of war danced it in the detention camp at Zomba, followed by detachments of the 2nd KAR when they returned to Nairobi.
In 1921, beni was linked to those who served in the WWI. In the late colonial period, beni was a way for young people to express their independence.
In Zanzibar, Beni is performed both as a street parade and stationary as a wedding dance.

Funan DigitaLife Mall

Funan DigitaLife Mall, formerly Funan The IT Mall and Funan Centre, was a shopping centre formerly located near the Civic District in Singapore. Completed in 1985, the mall specialised in electronics and IT-related goods. It was a more upmarket competitor of Sim Lim Square, the latter of which catered more to those seeking more budget purchases. It was closed and demolished in 2016.
History.
The mall opened in January 1985 as Funan Centre as a general shopping centre, which provided more options for shoppers to shop at other than Orchard Road. In the early 90s, the mall began to attract a critical mass of electronic and IT retailers over the years. Its main and long-time anchor tenant is Challenger Superstore, a major homegrown IT store established in 1984. In 1992, the mall was refurbished. It later adopted the name Funan The IT Mall in 1997 to reflect its current focus on IT related outlets. In 2005, the mall received minor upgrades, and was again renamed to Funan DigitaLife Mall.
There were a total of 178 outlets spread over six floors. Challenger Superstore occupied almost the entirety of the sixth floor, and was accompanied by another anchor tenants such as Harvey Norman in the other floors.
Decline and revamp.
Due to the popularity of online shopping, business at the mall had been declining over the past few years, forcing tenants to close down. The mall was initially planned to be renovated in 2014. However, it was later slated for demolition. The last day of mall operation was 30 June 2016. All tenants have since relocated and the building was later demolished.
The new commercial building known as Funan was being built on its former site. Originally slated to be reopened in 2020, the building was re-opened in June 2019. The new commercial building will have a 24-hour drive-thru, underground walkway to City Hall MRT station, The Adelphi Lifestyle Mall and Capitol Theatre. It also will have serviced apartments and offices as well. The new shopping mall was officially opened on its former site on 28 June 2019.
Transportation.
The nearest MRT Station to Funan DigtaLife Mall is City Hall MRT station (NS25/EW13).

William Tomison

William Tomison was a Scottish fur trader who helped found and build a number of trading posts for the Hudson Bay Company such as the Edmonton House. He was involved in the fur trade for over thirty years, during which time he served in York Factory and the Severn House. During his fifty years of service with the Hudson Bay Company, Tomison worked his way through the ranks.
Early life.
Tomison was born in the Orkney Islands in 1739.
Career.
William Tomison's career with the Hudson Bay Company started in 1760. There was a lack of trading posts in particular areas, when Tomison started there was not one in the Western interior. This was vital information that helped William Tomison progress within the Hudson Bay Company, giving him insight. He progressed within the Hudson Bay Company and moved through the ranks and became the Governor Inland Master and later helped them as a company to expand. Whilst the smallpox epidemic occurred Tomison's journals showcased the sheer work that had and the employees at Cumberland House to be put in to try and help the Aboriginal people. It displayed a compassionate side to Tomison despite many regarding him as a man that was not pleasant, but the journal suggests that he was not entirely cold-hearted. William Tomison was selected to lead the Hudson Bay Company's expansion and this one could suggest he was partly the reason for the Hudson Bay Company compete throughout Saskatchewan River with other Canadian traders. After the outbreak of the smallpox disease in 1730 the pursuit and conquest to gain control of fur production was important. William gained hands on experience in a somewhat unconventional manner. For the duration of two years Tomison was at the Lake Winnipeg and gained invaluable education that helped set him apart from other Hudson Bay Traders. During that period he learned and he understood the Aboriginal customs, language and their general community. In 1767 Tomison became one of Hudson Bay's inland travellers from York Factory He was one of the earliest employees that were sent to network and create vital connection with the First Nations. Tomison's personality hindered him from progressing any further in the company. Many Indians refused to trade and directly make deals with him which was arguably, one of the reasons that jeopardised Tomison moving higher. He delegated with authority and recorded his thoughts in his journal, although he protected his men and tried to ensure they were safe in the process he stated that "its dangerous to send out men with the Natives at present, as several of them is of a very savage Nature." However due to his observation there were new strategies put in place, the traders made the decision to avoid the Natives from seeing them so they shipped furs during the night. There was great hunger during this time and there were extreme measures put in place
Smallpox epidemic.
At the beginning of the 1780s there was an outbreak of smallpox in the Western Canada, the Northern Great Plains which severely affected the villages and the population reduced drastically in size by about 70-80%. William Tomison is greatly known for the records that he made of this epidemic, he recorded in his diary in great detail concerning this. Giving thorough detail and updates regarding Cree Indians who were struck by smallpox, he also journalled about those that came to him to seek help. His journal contained great detail about this outbreak and it brought clarity about the epidemic. From records and accounts from the time it is clear that the British employees did not suffer from smallpox as they were in contact with it or had smallpox or a similar disease when they were infants. The British employees of HBC did not contract or catch this disease because they had smallpox, cowpox or chicken pox when they were infants. This led to them being immune to the disease when it spread in Western Canada Employees that were Hudson Bay Company and Canadians (despite sexual activity between Indigenous women and employees being banned) were sensitive to the disease, however some individuals did not contract the disease. Unfortunately, there is no concrete evidence to show that the Aboriginal people blamed the British or French traders for this incident.
Edmonton House.
Edmonton House, built in October 1795. Tomison was the founder of Edmonton House and the Officer, Chief from 1795-98. After him succeeded James Curtis. Buckingham House, Cumberland House and Hudson House were properties that were a part of the Hudson Bay Company.
Food shortages.
In 1880 there were severe food shortages and some of the workers decided to stay with Indigenous peoples so that they could survive through the winter. Changes in climate essentially led to starvation due to food shortages in the area. The primary cause of large loss of life due to smallpox was not solely due to the shortage of food, however, the lack did not help strengthen the individuals in any way. It hindered them and correlated with the lack of wild animals to kill, which connected with the change in climate.
Journal.
The journals Tomison wrote not only shed light from a personal perspective onto the events that had occurred. But there was a constant entries into the journal with his private thoughts regarding the epidemic and how it had affected the land, the people and the business. This journal gives great insight into one's life during the spread of smallpox in the 1780. This enables Historians and other fields such as sociologists, biologists in their quest to understand when a particular epidemic occurred, where it spanned geographically. The personal account also shows the impact it had on people that knew those that died and the effect it had on their lives, or the extent it affected both communities. There were many observations and accounts that were made by Tomison, daily reflections that covered the fluctuations in daily life and the way the smallpox affected those in his surrounding area. In his entries it gav insight into what was going on during that time but it also brought forth parts of his character and his perspective on particular matters. In one journal entry on December 25, 1781 it states "in the Evening Traded with the Indians &amp; made them presents as usual, but never expect to see them again." The personal accounts from William Tomison expose the true feelings of one working first hand in the fur trade and having to negotiate, experiencing the epidemics and starvation that spanned across Western Canada.

Sea ice microbial communities

Sea Ice Microbial Communities (SIMCO) refer to groups of microorganisms living within and at the interfaces of sea ice at the poles. The ice matrix they inhabit has strong vertical gradients of salinity, light, temperature and nutrients. Sea ice chemistry is most influenced by the salinity of the brine which affects the pH and the concentration of dissolved nutrients and gases. The brine formed during the melting sea ice creates pores and channels in the sea ice in which these microbes can live. As a result of these gradients and dynamic conditions, a higher abundance of microbes are found in the lower layer of the ice, although some are found in the middle and upper layers. Despite this extreme variability in environmental conditions, the taxonomical community composition tends to remain consistent throughout the year, until the ice melts.
Much of the knowledge concerning the community diversity of the sea ice is known through genetic analyses and next-generation sequencing. In both the Arctic and Antarctic, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteriia are the common bacterial classes found. Most sea ice Archaea belong to the phylum Thaumarchaeota while most of the protists belong to one of 3 supergroups: Alveolata, Stramenopile and Rhizaria. The abundance of living cells within and on sea ice ranges from 104-108 cells/mL. These microbial communities play a significant role in the microbial loop as well as in global biogeochemical cycles. Sea ice communities are important because they provide an energy source for higher trophic levels, they contribute to primary production and they provide a net influx of Carbon in the oceans at the poles.
Habitat.
Sea ice matrix: chemical and physical properties.
Sea ice formation and physical properties.
The autumnal decrease in atmospheric temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic leads to the formation of a surface layer of ice crystals called frazil ice. A mixture of salts, nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) known as brine is expelled when frazil ice solidifies to form sea ice. Brine permeates through the ice cover and creates a network of channels and pores. This process forms an initial semisolid matrix of approximately 1 meter in thickness with strong temperature, salinity, light and nutrient gradients.
Since thickening of the sea ice during winter months results in more salts being expelled from the frazil ice, atmospheric temperatures are strongly and negatively correlated to brine salinity. The sea ice-seawater interface temperature is maintained at the freezing point of seawater (~1.8 °C) while the sea ice-air interface reflects more the current atmospheric temperature. Brine salinity can increase to as much as 100 PSU when sea ice temperature reaches ~3 °C below the freezing point of seawater. Brine temperature typically ranges from -1.9 to -6.7 °C in the winter. Sea ice temperatures fluctuate in response to irradiance and atmospheric temperatures, but also change in response to the volume of snowfall. Accumulating snow on the ice cover combined with harsh atmospheric conditions can lead to the formation of a snowpack layer that absorbs UV radiations and provides insulation to the bottom ice layer. The fraction of irradiance reaching the sea ice matrix is thus also controlled by the amount of snowfall and varies from &lt;0.01% to 5% depending on the thickness and density of the snowpack.
The surface of sea ice also allows the formation of frost flowers, which have their own unique microbial communities.
Carbon species, nutrients and gases.
The fluctuation of brine salinity, which is controlled by atmospheric temperatures, is the single-most influential factor on the chemistry of the sea ice matrix. The solubility of carbon dioxide and oxygen, two biologically essential gases, decreases in higher salinity solutions. This can result in hypoxia within high heterotrophic activity regions of the sea ice matrix. Regions of high photosynthetic activity often exhibit internal depletion of inorganic carbon compound and hyperoxia. These conditions have the potential to elevate brine pH and to further contribute to the creation of an extreme environment. In these conditions, high concentrations of DOM and ammonia and low concentrations of nutrients often characterize the ice matrix.
High brine salinity combined with an elevated pH reduces the rate at which gases and inorganic nutrients diffuse into the ice matrix. The concentration of nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate inside the sea ice matrix relies largely on the diffusive influx from the sea ice-water interface and to some extent on the atmospheric deposits on the sea ice-air interface. Iron concentrations in the Southern Ocean ice cover are thought to be regulated by the amount of new iron supply at the time of ice formation and were shown to be reduced during late winter.
The chemical properties of the sea ice matrix are highly complex and depend on the interaction between the internal sea ice biological assemblage as well as external physical factors. Winters are typically characterized by moderate oxygen levels that are accompanied by nutrient and inorganic carbon concentrations that are not growth limiting to phytoplankton. Summers are typically characterized by high oxygen levels that are accompanied by a depletion of nutrients and inorganic carbon. Because of its diffusive interaction with seawater, the lower part of the sea ice matrix is typically characterized by higher nutrient concentrations.
Colonization.
Microorganisms present in the surface seawater during fall are integrated in the brine solution during ice formation. A small proportion of the initial microbial population colonizes the ice matrix while the rest is expelled with brine. Studies have shown that sea ice microbial retention can be enhanced by the presence of extracellular polymeric substance/polysaccharides (EPS) on the walls of the brine channels. EPS are proteins expressed on the cell walls of microorganism such as algae. They improve the cell adherence to surfaces and when found in sufficient concentration, are thought to play a role in recruiting other organisms such as microbes.
Airborne microorganisms make up a significant proportion of the microbial input to the ice matrix. Microorganisms located in the sea or in the ice matrix brine can be incorporated in falling snow or in aerosols, and subsequently transported by strong winds such as the West Wind Drift that causes the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. These airborne microorganisms can originate from terrestrial environment and marine environment, thus contributing to the diversity of the SIMCO.
Distribution.
Spatial Distribution.
Microbes colonizing the Antarctic sea ice are eventually incorporated in the pore spaces and brine channels of the ice matrix, but can also inhabit the ice-seawater interface. Pore spaces in the matrix lose their ability to exchange nutrients, DOM and microorganisms with brine at approximately -5 °C. This suggests that the Antarctic microbial community is fluid along the ice matrix during fall and spring and that it is restricted during winter.
In the Arctic, brine channels are also inhabited by bacteria. Channels as small as ≤200 μm offer a spatial refuge with microbial community concentrations of 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than in the remaining channel network.
Both the Antarctic and Arctic sea ice environments present strong vertical gradients of salinity, temperature, light, nutrients and DOM. These gradients were shown to induce strong vertical stratification in bacterial communities throughout the ice layer. Microbial abundance declines significantly with depth in the upper and middle ice, but not in the lowest, suggesting that much of the prokaryotic bacterial community is resistant to extreme environmental conditions. Heterotrophic bacteria were also shown to be more abundant at the bottom of the ice layer in zones of greater algae concentration, which characterized by higher DOM and nutrient concentrations.
Temporal Distribution.
The temporal distribution of microbial community composition in the Antarctic and Arctic sea ice does not present significant seasonal variability, despite extremes in environmental conditions. Previous studies of sea ice habitats have shown that the composition of SIMCO in early fall is identical to the source seawater community. The microbial community composition does not seem to change significantly in fall and winter, despite the extreme variability in irradiance, temperature, salinity and nutrient concentrations. In contrast, the abundance within the SIMCO is reduced throughout the winter as resources become limiting. Studies have shown that sea ice microalgae provide a platform and organic nutrient source for bacterial growth, therefore increasing community diversity and abundance. It has also been proven that microbes produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to help retain nutrients and survive under high salinity and low temperature conditions.
The increase in irradiance levels in late spring promotes ice algal photosynthesis which in turn affects the microbial community abundance and composition. While most of the sea ice cover melts in late spring in the Antarctic and Arctic, multiyear sea ice occasionally persists when late spring and summer temperatures are lower than average. This suggests that certain microbial lineages may have adapted more efficiently to the extreme conditions of sea ice environments. Temporal abundance can also be affected by the thickness of the annual ice cover and seasonal temperature variations. The ice cover thickness was shown to regulate microbial production and the temperature of the ice matrix through layer insulation.
Community composition.
A majority of the information on sea ice microbial community composition comes from 16S ribosomal RNA taxonomic marker genes and metagenomic analyses. Next-generation sequencing has allowed researcher to identify and quantify microbial communities, and to gain a more complete understanding of its structure.
Bacteria.
Arctic.
Metagenomic studies of Arctic sea ice show classes Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria. Within the Flavobacteriia class the genera Polaribacter, Psychrobacter, Psychroflexus, and Flavobacterium are the most common. Within Gammaproteobacteria the genera Glaciecola and Colwellia are the most common. Also found in Arctic sea ice samples were bacteria of the following classes and phyla: Opitutae, Bacilli, Cyanobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Sphingobacteria, and Aquificae.
Antarctic.
Metagenomic studies of the Ross Sea illustrate the high abundance of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in sea ice environments. These specialists were shown to mostly belong to the Alphaproteobacteria class. Genera of the Alphaproteobacteria class were shown to include Loktanella, Octadecabacter, Roseobacter, Sulfitobacter and Methylobacterium and to agree with previous phylogenetic analyses of sea ice around the Antarctic. A study of the SIMCO 16S ribosomal RNA at Cape Hallett in the Antarctic has shown that aerobic oxygenic phototrophic bacteria may be equally abundant.
Members of the Gammaproteobacteria and Flaviobacteria classes were also shown to be abundant within the ice matrix, and thus to be adapted to the sea ice conditions. Genera of the Gammaproteobacteria class found in the Ross Sea and around the Antarctic waters include Colwellia, Marionomonas, Pseudoalteromonas and Psychrobacter. The orders Chlamydiales and Verrucomicrobiales were also found in the sea ice microbial assemblage of these locations. The predominance of Gammaproteobacteria in sea ice around the globe have been reported by many studies. A large proportion of the identified SIMCO in these studies were shown to belong to phylotypes associated with heterotrophic taxa
While this gives researchers an insight into the microbial community composition of the Antarctic sea ice, there are clear shifts between locations in the Southern Ocean. These shifts are attributed to biological and physical forcing factors. These factors include the composition of the microbial communities in place at the moment of sea ice formation, and the regional weather and wind patterns affecting the transport of snow and aerosols.
Archaea.
Studies of the 16s ribosomal RNA subunits found in the sea ice cover of Terra Nova Bay have shown that archaea consist of ≤ 6.6% of the total prokaryotic community in this environment. 90.8% of this archaeal community belonged to the phylum Thaumarchaeota, a close parent to marine ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, while Euryarchaeota made up the rest of the community. Other molecular phylogenetic analyses of the SIMCO have detected no trace of the archaeal domain.
Protists.
Metagenomic studies of Arctic sea ice using 454 sequencing of 18S rDNA and 18S rRNA. These studies showed dominance of three supergroups: Alveolata, Stramenophile, and Rhizaria. Within the Alveolates most common were Ciliates, and Dinoflagellates. Within the Stramenophile group most organisms were classified as Bacillariophyceae. Finally most of the Rhizarians were classified as from Thecofilosea.
Adaptation.
Studies have shown that high concentrations of microbial cryoprotective exopolymer (EPS) were found in the sea ice brine. These EPS were shown to correlate with a stable microbial community composition throughout the winter season. They are thought to play an important role in sea ice environments where they act as a buffer and cryoprotectant against high salinity and ice-crystal damage. These exopolymers are believed to constitute a microbial adaptation to low temperatures in extreme environments.
Sea ice microbes have also developed anti-freeze proteins, which prevent the formation of ice crystals that could damage bacterial membranes. It is common for these proteins to be rich in beta-sheets as they prevent the formation of ice crystals/
Metabolic diversity.
Role in the Microbial Loop.
Bacteria in all environments contribute to the microbial loop, but the roles of sea ice microbial communities in the microbial loop differ due to the rapidly changing environmental conditions found in the Arctic and Antarctic. Sea ice algae contribute 10%–28% of the total primary production in ice-covered regions of the Antarctic. Microalgae provide a vital source of nutrition for juvenile zooplankton such as the Antarctic krill "Euphausia superba" in the winter. DOM derived from phototrophic microalgae is crucial to the microbial loop, by serving as a growth substrate for heterotrophic bacteria.
The microbial loop functions differently in sea ice, as compared to oligotrophic or temperate waters. Animals found in the extreme polar environments depend on the high bacterial production as a food source, despite the slow turnover of DOM. The microbial production of ammonium in nitrate-rich Antarctic waters may provide the necessary reductants for nitrogen fixation, increasing primary productivity of light-limited phytoplankton. Phytoflagellates and diatoms found in the Antarctic pelagic environment are directly digestible by metozoan herbivores.

Rome, Ellis County, Kansas

Rome was a short-lived postbellum frontier settlement in Ellis County, Kansas, United States.
Rome is notable for its association with the early plains career of its co-founder, William Frederick "Buffalo Bill" Cody. Rome was the first town established within the future Ellis County, followed very shortly by rival Hays City.
History.
In 1867, William Rose, a railroad contractor, and William Cody founded the townsite to take advantage of the recent relocation of Fort Hays adjacent to the planned crossing of Big Creek by the Kansas Pacific Railway. It soon became a recreation center for 1200 railroad construction workers as well as their shelter in the indian conflict that the railroad construction triggered. However, the railway's selection of Hays City for the station combined with the cholera outbreak in Rome the same summer resulted in the wholesale abandonment of the town in favor of Hays City.
In 1868, the Clarkson Brothers, Charlie, Matthew, and George, set their buffalo hunting headquarters at the abandoned Rome site. By 1872, they had completed the requirements for their homestead claim on the land Rome had occupied.
Although the town had quickly failed, Cody maintained an interest in the location. At the 1876 Centennial Exposition, Cody convinced I. M. Yost (the husband of a cousin) to build a water-powered grain mill at Rome. With assistance from soldiers from Fort Hays, Yost built a wooden dam there on Big Creek to power the mill and provide ice to the fort. While the dam was soon destroyed by animals and flooding and the mill by fire, Yost was committed to the locality and built more mills in and around Hays, and later founded nearby Yocemento.
A map of Rome was reconstructed in the 1930s as a WPA project. This map was compiled by H. R. Pollock from newspaper articles, interviews, and correspondence with people with historical connection with the town, including I. M. Yost, the miller, C. L. Henderson, who had a farm adjoining Rome, and Simon Motz, an early settler in Rome.
The historic townsite north of Noose Road is presently a private gated facility, managed by Rome Corporation. 
Hangman's Bridge.
In late-1867, the Kansas Pacific Railway completed a wooden through-truss bridge across Big Creek. Vigilantes active in early treeless Hays City used the bridge for hangings, and so it is known locally as Hangman's Bridge. Although the bridge was a full mile west from the early Hays City, it adjoined Rome; the Clarkson brothers noted seeing a body hanging on the bridge (probably Jack McGee who had stabbed a police constable, Frank Sheperd).
The bridge site is particularly associated with the 1869 lynching of three black soldiers of the 38th United States Colored Infantry Regiment.
Transportation.
The Kansas Pacific track defined the southern edge of the Rome townsite. Here, the railroad was constructed at a significantly elevated grade justified by the potential for flooding on Big Creek. However, town residents suspected that the excessively elevated tracks were built intentionally to interfere with commerce of the town. The combination of the high track with the deeply cut ravine of Big Creek surrounding the remaining boundaries of Rome resulted in the derisive nickname "The Walled City". Today, the track is operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. 
In 1867, the Ellis Trail passed along the north side of the town, crossing Big Creek at the east and west ends. The Butterfield Overland Despatch briefly operated a station in Rome, before relocating to Hays City.
Originally constructed as "Yocemento Road", present day Rome Avenue passes through the townsite east and west, crossing Big Creek just east of the townsite (This road was named Noose Road in 1989 for 9-1-1 services; but, was renamed to Rome Avenue in 2020.)
While Rome Avenue was the original U.S. Route 40 alignment (locally "Highway 40"), the United States Highway system vacated this alignment in 1947 when the highway and railroad tracks were realigned at Yocemento, moving the highway just to the south of the tracks between Yocemento and Hays. This newer alignment lost the U.S. Route 40 designation when Interstate 70 was completed and the road is now named Old Hwy 40.
Rome Road makes a short connection across the track between Rome Avenue and Old Hwy 40.

Career.
Born in Ghanaian capital city of Accra Mensah grew up with his mother, sister and two brothers. As a child he started playing football at age 14 in the Accra football school. Here he was noticed by a Ghanaian prosecutor, who had contacts with Italian agents. From there begins his adventure in Europe. In January 2015, Mensah leaves his family and Ghana and moves to Italy by plane. His first audition was with the Primavera team of Sampdoria, followed by the transfer to Sorrento. He was registered by Taranto but made no appearances because of bureaucratic problems. In between he was registered for the youth team of Santo Agnello. Pino De Filippis discovered him and brought him to Vastese thus Mensah becoming one of the biggest talents of Group F. He became new player of Vastese at late August 2016. He made 29 appearances for Vastese in 2016–17.
During winter-break of 2017–18 season he joined FK Temnić Lipa Varvarin playing in the Serbian First League.
In summer 2018 he return to Italy and joined Castelvetro Calcio.

Awapoko River is an estuary, almost long, where the Aurere and Parapara Streams merge before entering Doubtless Bay in the Northland Region of New Zealand.
Ngāti Kahu had lived in the area for about 700 years until most of their land was sold under government pressure in the 1850s.
The present land use is predominantly a mix of agriculture, forestry, housing along SH10, indigenous vegetation and sand-dunes.
Spotless crake, banded rail, bittern and herons live in the estuary.
Despite court action in 2011, a 2016 report said the Aurere Stream "stands out in particular as having degraded water quality".

<doc id="56980761" url="?curid=56980761" title="Gynaephora rossii">
Gynaephora rossii

Gynaephora rossii, in English known as Ross' tussock moth, is a species of tussock moth in the family Erebidae. It is widespread in the tundras and highlands of the Holarctic. It has large, furry caterpillars which seem to eat mostly saxifrages.
Taxonomy.
This moth was first described in 1835 by John Curtis as "Laria rossii", who placed it in the genus "Laria" described by Franz von Paula Schrank in 1802; the genus "Laria", however, had already been used in 1763 for a genus of beetles by Scolipi (now "Pria"), so the species required moving to another genus. Heinrich Benno Möschler first moved it to the genus "Dasychira" in his 1870 work on the moths of Labrador. Otto Staudinger also classified it in the genus "Dasychira" in 1901, but in 1927 William Schaus moved it to the genus "Byrdia". Also in 1927 Otto Bang-Haas described the subspecies "Dasychira rossii relictus" from the eastern Sayan Mountains. A year later, in 1928, Shōnen Matsumura described "Konokareha daisetsuzana" from a single specimen from the Daisetsu mountains in Hokkaido, but in 1932 Max Gaede synonymised "Konokareha daisetsuzana" to "Dasychira rossii relictus". In 1956 Hiroshi Inoue subsumed "Konokareha daisetsuzana" as an independent subspecies under "Byrdia rossii" instead, and moved the "relictus" subspecies to the "Byrdia" genus as well, giving three subspecies including the nominate. Inoue states, however, that although he finds the type of "Konokareha daisetsuzana" distinctive enough, his own just collected specimen, in his time only the second moth of this species ever found in Japan, was almost identical to the nominate form, and that he found the validity of the taxon potentially untenable.
"Gynaephora lugens" was described by Igor Vasilii Kozhanchikov in 1948 from northern Siberia in eastern Russia. Dubatolov published an article in 1997 in which he mentioned doubting the taxonomic distinctiveness of "G. lugens" from "G. rossii", based on the identical wing pattern and the morphology of the genitalia. In 2015 Lukhtanov and Khruleva subsumed it under "G. rossii" as a subspecies based on DNA and morphological research.
It has been placed in the subfamily Lymantriinae (the tussock moths) and the tribe Orgyiini.
Etymology.
According to one website the generic epithet "Gynaephora" means 'women-seeker', which refers to the behaviour of the males. However, the word "gynaephora" in fact means 'women-bringer' or 'bringer-of-woman'; it is compounded from the Greek γυνή ("guní"), meaning "woman", and φορά ("phorá"), usually meaning "bringer" (along with some other related meanings). The specific epithet commemorates John Ross who lead the for which John Curtis served as an entomologist.
Subspecies.
There are two subspecies recorded as accepted in The Global Lepidoptera Names Index (LepIndex) belonging to the species "Gynaephora rossii" as of 2011:
These subspecies are not necessarily recognised:
Description.
The females have a forewing length of 17 mm, the males slightly smaller. The hindwings of the males are a light ochre yellow, with a dark gray band along the edge of the wing, and a light amount of hairs extending from that edge (fringe). The hindwings of the females are dark brownish grey and also have a band. Both sexes have mottled grey forewings with jagged black lines across them. There is further a small black disc-shaped dot surrounded by paler grey, and a black and pale grey mark near the end similar to the mark in other Orgyiini. The antenna has teeth- or comb-like structures on both sides, these are larger in males.
The eggs are around 1.4 mm.
The caterpillars are densely covered in soft grey hairs and have seven pairs of tufts of yellow hair on their back, while most other Lymantriinae have five pairs of tufts.
The cocoon is made of silk, incorporating the hairs of the caterpillars on the outside, and is about the size of the cocoon of a common silkworm, oval-shaped and coloured grey.
Similar species.
It is most likely to be confused in British Columbia with "Polia richardsoni", which has wings of a similar colour and is in flight at the same month as this moth. That species has a different wing pattern, hair on its eyes and a much thinner antenna. They can be distinguished from their congener "Gynaephora groenlandica" in the larvae by the form of their hairs, which are finer and feather-like (plumose) in contrast to stiffer and un-branched (spinulose) hairs. "G. rossii" imagos (adults) have more patterned wings than "G. groenlandica" and "G. groenlandica" lack the broad, dark band along the edge of their hind wings characteristic of "G. rossii". The two species are sympatric in Arctic areas in northern Canada and the Canadian archipelago, and on Wrangel Island in Russia. The eggs are somewhat smaller and the cocoons of this species are single-layered, as opposed to the double-layered cocoons of "G. groenlandica".
Distribution.
"Gynaephora rossii rossii".
The nominate subspecies occurs in the United States and Canada, In the United States it occurs in Alaska, and isolated populations occur on mountaintops in the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians. Alpine populations occur in Maine (at the top of Mount Katahdin), in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Wyoming and Colorado. There is also a specimen from Michigan.
In Canada it is known from Labrador, Yukon (far northern coast and the Richardson Mountains), Northwest Territories (North Slave Region, Fort Smith, Ulukhaktok), Mackenzie County in far northern Alberta, northern Manitoba (outside the town of Churchill), British Columbia (Pink Mountain and the north) and Nunavut (Somerset Island, Bylot Island, north to coasts on central Ellesmere Island).
It has been recorded from northernmost Alaska in Point Barrow, along the Meade River and elsewhere in Alaska North Slope, and southwards in Lake and Peninsula, the Darby Mountains, the city of Fairbanks, and alpine areas in Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. In Colorado it has been recorded in Clear Creek County, Teller County (Florissant) and Rocky Mountain National Park. In New Hampshire it has been found in Coös County in the village of Jefferson and on Mount Washington.
"Gynaephora rossii relictus".
This taxon was originally described from the eastern Sayan Mountains, while the taxon "daisetsuzana", now considered a synonym, was only known from the mountains of Hokkaido in Japan. It has also been recorded from the mountains of Buryatia and at low elevations in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. "G. rossii lugens", sometimes considered a synonym of the previous subspecies, occurs in Russia from the Siberian Arctic from the northern Urals and the Yamal Peninsula eastwards to the Chukchi Peninsula, north to the Arctic Ocean and on Wrangel Island. Southwards it is only found in mountainous areas such as in the Suntar-Khayata Range (eastern Yakutia), the mountains of southern Yakutia and southwest Irkutsk Oblast, the Yablonoi Mountains of Chita Oblast, and mountains in the northern regions of Amur Oblast, in Kamchatka and in northern Magadan Oblast along the upper reaches of the Kolyma River.
Ecology.
Habitat.
This day-flying moth is found in tundras in Arctic and Subarctic areas. It also occurs in rocky alpine tundra habitats on top of high mountains, and has been caught flying in muskeg habitat with trees growing in it in Canada. It is able to survive in extreme environments such as at 2200m above sea level in the Suntar-Khayata Range or at 2400m in Buryatia. It has been recorded at altitudes of 1561m in Coös County, New Hampshire, at 800m in the Richardson Mountains, Yukon, Canada, and at 300m in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia.
Behaviour.
The females have fully developed wings and can fly, although they usually do not, but are said to "call out" to the males. This allows the female to save energy. The males are slightly smaller than the females. Males fly rapidly searching for the females during daylight, and are difficult to catch unless waiting near a "calling" female. They are usually on the wing in July in northern British Columbia, although this can depend on the weather and if the snow has melted. On Somerset Island in Nunavut the moths and their caterpillars would appear in large numbers for one or two days in June. In North America as a whole adults have been collected from May to August. In the mountains of Hokkaido females of this species do fly; in this area they lay eggs on upright, woody plant stems. On Ellesmere Island the females typically lay their eggs in a mass on or in their cocoon, although they sometimes lay their eggs on the ground or on vegetation around the cocoon. Females can produce fertile eggs without mating (parthenogenesis). Vladimir Dubatolov was able to rear a female from eastern Yakutia, and subsequently from northwestern Chukotka, without a male present from its emergence from its cocoon, and both times the moths laid eggs which hatched into viable caterpillars. Despite the large distance between these two localities, on Ellesmere Island in Canada Morewood did not observe the same.
The caterpillars may take many years to metamorphose, seven to eleven years. In the Suntar-Khayata Range a cocoon was recovered on the end of a branch of a shrub of "Pinus pumila". In northwestern Chukotka Autonomous Okrug the caterpillars begin making their cocoons in August. The caterpillars can be exposed to subzero temperatures, in which they freeze solid, but when brought back indoors, many start moving around again as soon as they thaw. John Ross, when after being trapped in the ice of northern Canada for a number of years during his expedition seeking the Northwest Passage, kept and fed a number in the ship hold. These were repeatedly frozen and thawed through the winter; after four such cycles two survived to pupate, and of those one cocoon was full of flies whilst the other developed into a fully formed adult moth.
Species interactions.
The caterpillars feed on "Saxifraga tricuspidata", "S. oppositifolia", "Salix arctica", "Dryas" and possibly also "Potentilla". It has also been found on "Rubus acaulis", and caterpillars have been raised in laboratory settings on raspberry, "Rubus idaeus", leaves. In Russia the caterpillars were successfully raised no a diet of "Rosa", "Rubus" and "Taraxacum" in the laboratory. On Somerset Island their main food plants were recorded to be "Saxifraga tricuspidata" and "S. oppositifolia".
Ross observed many of the caterpillars parasitised by a species of ichneumonid wasp and a type of fly in the Canadian archipelago. Up to six flies can inhabit one caterpillar. The flies emerge from the cocoons or hibernaculae in the spring. These animals are parasitoids. The flies Ross saw were likely the tachinid fly "Chetogena gelida", which appears to be host specific to "Gynaephora rossii". On Ellesmere Island, where this moth was found to be sympatric with the closely related "G. groenlandica", "Chetogena gelida" only attacked "G. rossii", whereas the new species "Exorista thula" was only hosted by "G. groenlandica".
Despite living in areas free of bats, they still show avoidance responses to their sounds. In the High Arctic these moths are preyed upon by birds. The eggs are also eaten by small foraging birds; on Ellesmere Island such birds may tear open the cocoons to feed on the egg mass usually laid inside.
Uses.
This species is numbered as 8290 in the List of moths of North America (the MONA or Hodges number).
Conservation.
In 1832 is was recorded as common on the beach of Fury Bay of Somerset Island, Nunavut, with about a hundred specimens of caterpillars and moths collected on 16 June. In Hokkaido it would appear rarer, with only two specimens collected between the 1920s to the 1950s.
It has been recorded as present in the following protected areas:

Plot.
Once upon a time, there was a kingdom Malava. Its King Ugrasena (Gummadi) loves his daughter Rupa a lot. According to astrologer's prediction, Rupa marries an ordinary citizen. Here Ugrasena becomes furious and wants to change the fate, so, he finds whereabouts of the boy Chandrasena through astrologers and orders to eliminate him. But the boy escapes and grows up at an ashram along with his mother Annapurna (Malathi). Years roll by, once in hunting, Rupa (Jayasri) gets acquaintance with Chandrasena (N. T. Rama Rao) and both of them fall in love. Meanwhile, Ugrasena announces a sports competition in the capital in which Chandrasena prevails and the king honours him. That night, Chandrasena secretly enters the fort, meets Rupa and captured by soldiers. At that moment, Annapurna pleads the king to leave her son, but in vain Ugrasena recognises him as the same and commands to throw him into the cellar of demons. But Chandrasena kills the demon, reaches Rupa and while escaping they drop into a death house. Hence, the king announces whoever brings his daughter will be largess with a huge amount for which two guys, Takku (Relangi) and Tikku (Ramana Reddy) moves. In the death house, Rupa is caught by an enchanter (Shobhan Babu) and takes her to their Queen Gandharva Rani (Mohana) and entrusts a challenge of getting a musical tree to Chandrasena from "Chambala Island", ruled by wizard Kanakaksha (Mukkamala) in exchange of Rupa. After setting off on an adventurous journey, Chandrasena reaches the island where Kanakaksha's daughter Champa (Girija) falls for him, trapping her, he succeeds in achieving the musical tree and relieves Rupa. But unfortunately, Kanakaksha takes Chandrasena back by transforming into a garland. Helpless, Rupa seized by Takku-Tikku. Parallelly, on the island, Kanakaksha demands Chandrasena to marry his daughter, but he refuses, so, he keeps him in the prison and tortures. Fortunately, Rupa escapes from Takku-Tikku and gets back to the death house, reaches "Chamba Island" with the help of the musical tree and lets Chandrasena free.

The university is considered to be the leading educational, methodological and scientific center of the Russian Armed Forces. Since October 2017, the Commanding officer of the university has been Lieutenant General Igor Mishutkin.
History.
The Military University started as the Teaching Institute of the Red Army which opened on November 5, 1919 by the order of N.G. Tolmachev of the Petrograd Military District. The first commanding officer of the school was Mikhail Apletin. On August 1, 1974, the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union) was formed as an affiliated school of the Vladimir Lenin Military-Political Academy. The modern university was established on July 20, 1994 on the basis of the unification of the Military-Political Academy and Military Institute of the Armed Forces of the USSR. For the first time in one school, the economic, humanitarian, legal and philological areas of officer training were taught at the university level.
Offerings.
The university focuses on the five areas of military-humanitarian, military-legal, military-philological, military-conductor and military-financial. It has undergraduate, post graduate and professional continuing education. There are 53 departments across 10 faculties. It teaches 22 foreign languages. There are 11 dissertation councils. In addition to training active duty military, the school offers 15 civilian specialties for recently discharged military members seeking retraining.
The university is organized into the following sections:
Institute of Military Band Conductors.
The Institute of Military Band Conductors (), which falls as part of the College of Military Music, is a sub-branch of the Military University of the Ministry of Defense. The institute is a unique educational institution providing training for military conductors with a higher musical education for the armed forces and foreign states. Many graduates of the military institute have become laureates of international and national competitions, leading Military bands that conduct active concert activities in Russia and abroad.
History.
The history of the institution dates back to 1935, when a military department was created on the basis of the department of the orchestra faculty of the Moscow State Conservatory. In 1938, the faculty was expanded, organizing full-time post-graduate studies in the specialties of conducting and instrumentation. In 1944, the military department became a separate military musical university and in August 1945, the university was solemnly awarded Battle Banner. In November 1946, the university was renamed to the Higher School of Military Conductors of the Soviet Army. In 1960, during a campaign to reduce the size of the Soviet Armed Forces, the Institute of Military Conductors was reorganized into the Military Conducting Department at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory 
On 4 April 2001, the Government of Russia renamed the department as the Moscow Military Conservatory. On 10 April 2006, it was transferred to the Military University, becoming today the Institute of Military Band Conductors.
Activities.
It often holds inter-university practical conferences on musical training methods.
Bands.
The Cadet Band of the Institute of Military Band Conductors () is a military marching band and instrumental ensemble in the Ministry of Defense of Russia (MOD) and the larger Russian Armed Forces. The band has repeatedly performed at international competitions and festivals, in various television and radio broadcasts. The university band team is the affiliated marching band of the university, being the equivalent of the Band of the Royal Military College of Canada. It is a diploma winner of the review competition of the regular military bands of Moscow Military District. It plays an important role in the educational activities of the university. It annually participates in the Moscow Victory Day Parade and the parade dedicated to 1941 October Revolution Parade. It often performs at central venues in Moscow, such as the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, the Central Academic Theater of the Russian Army, and the Central House of Officers of the Russian Army.
Foreign students.
Most nations in the Commonwealth of Independent States have an agreement with the university that calls for the intake of their military personnel into the university. A number of individual Arab countries (Libya, Yemen, Egypt etc.) are being trained at graduate courses of the special faculty of the Military University. In January 2020, the Council of Ministers of Thailand approved a draft agreement on sending cadets of the Royal Thai Armed Forces cadets to courses at the university.

Carcuma Conservation Park (formerly Carcuma National Park) is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Carcuma about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north-east of the town of Coonalpyn.
The conservation park consists of crown land in section 23 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Carcuma. It acquired protected area status as the "Carcuma National Park" on 28 August 1969 by proclamation under the "National Parks Act 1966". On 27 April 1972, it was reconstituted as the "Carcuma Conservation Park" upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:Carcuma is a moderately large park featuring mallee heath vegetation representative of the original vegetation which once covered much of the region. The park displays a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Carcuma Conservation Park is situated on an undulating plain featuring large stabilized sand ridges and numerous small depressions. The dominant vegetation associations are "Banksia ornata" / "Casuarina" sp / "Xanthorrhoea australis" open heath with "Eucalyptus incrassata mallee" scrub. Discrete areas of "E. leucoxylon" and "E. baxteri" open forest are found in depressions and on the lee side of dunes respectively. This park is in a relatively undisturbed condition with cultural and disturbed natural surrounds. Access is limited to 4-wheel drive vehicles. This and its size affords added protection from disturbance.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category Ia protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Forest for the Trees (album)

Forest for the Trees is the debut studio album by Forest for the Trees. It was released through DreamWorks Records on September 9, 1997. It peaked at number 190 on the "Billboard" 200 chart and number 16 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. "Dream" was released as a single, peaking at number 72 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and number 18 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.
Background.
Forest for the Trees' Carl Stephenson co-wrote and co-produced Beck's 1993 song "Loser". Signed to Geffen Records at that time, Stephenson submitted an entire album of songs. After recording the album, Stephenson was hospitalized with a mental illness. Stephenson, his family and the label thought it best not to release the album at the time. However, his health condition improved afterward and they thought that releasing the album would help him deal financially and emotionally with the healing process.
Release.
The album was released through DreamWorks Records, Geffen Records' sister label, on September 9, 1997. Prior to the release of the album, "Dream" was released as a single. Kevin Godley directed the music video for the song. In the music video, Stephenson was seen briefly in a still photograph.
Critical reception.
Kembrew McLeod of AllMusic says, "Forest for the Trees tries to be everything at once and ends up being nothing at all, pleasing only those who favor 'interesting in theory' collage-oriented music over some semblance of catchy songs." Meanwhile, James Lien of "CMJ New Music Report" called Carl Stephenson "one of the key architects of the zeitgeist of the times." He said, "Stephenson creates a musical world where hip-hop beats blend with bagpipes and B-movie sitars, acoustic folk guitar strums, found vocal samples and hazy, dazed stoner raps."

Levi Isaacs

Levi Isaacs (c. 1860 – 30 October 1913) was a tobacconist and Jewish lay leader in Adelaide, South Australia and Melbourne, Victoria.
History.
Isaacs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the eldest son of itinerant jeweller Solomon Isaacs (c. 1830 – 30 August 1917) and his wife Pauline (c. 1830 – 14 July 1923), and came to South Australia with his parents and their family around 1865 and settled at 4 Tavistock Street, Adelaide.
He was educated at the Pulteney Street School and at Adelaide Educational Institution. His father opened a jeweller's and watchmaker's shop in Rundle Street, where by 1875 Isaacs was being employed. By 1884 his father had a tobacconist's shop on Rundle Street east between Pulteney Street and Synagogue Place. He also ran a tailor's establishment.
Isaacs was a serious young man, and showed great interest in religion and literature. He became a leading lay member of Adelaide synagogue's congregation:
He travelled extensively throughout South Australia, particularly the north as far as Oodnadatta, where he founded a literary society.
Isaacs ran the well-known tobacconist's business at "Isaacs' Corner" on the north corner of King William and Hindley streets 1891–1904, and was charter president of the South Australian Retail Tobacconists' Association 1894–1897. This was at a time when the retail tobacco shops were being used by many as a front for illegal "tote" bookmakers.
Citing health reasons, Isaacs left for Melbourne in May 1904, where his reputation had preceded him and was soon just as immersed in the Jewish community there as he had been in Adelaide.
He took over John Lipshut's tobacconist's shop on the corner of Swanston and Little Collins streets. His son Eric took "The White Florist" shop next door.
He became president of the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, serving for three years, and was also president of the Melbourne Jewish Philanthropic Society, United Jewish Educational Board, and the Melbourne Tobacconists' Association. They had a home at 30 Jackson Street, St. Kilda, Victoria, where he died.
Recognition.
The northern corner of the Hindley Street - King William Street intersection was for years known as "Isaacs' Corner". It had been previously known as "Platt's Corner", then "Howell's Corner", and was also known as "Stump's Corner" for its dominating signs advertising the upstairs premises of photographer Alfred Stump, where one of Adelaide's many fires started in 1900.
Family.
Solomon Isaacs (c. 1830 – 30 August 1913) and his wife Pauline (c. 1830 – 14 July 1923), married at Sernas Golenz, Germany, on 6 October 1855, lived in Newcastle upon Tyne, emigrated to South Australia aboard "Sophia" around 1865 Their family included:

"Scoobynatural" is the 16th episode of the 13th season of the paranormal drama series "Supernatural", and the 280th episode overall. The episode was written by Jim Krieg and Jeremy Adams and directed in live action by Robert Singer and in animation by Spike Brandt. It is the only "Supernatural" episode to be animated by Warner Bros. Animation. It was first broadcast on March 29, 2018, on The CW. In the episode, Sam, Dean, and Castiel are sucked into the animated world of "Scooby-Doo" and must help the Scooby Gang solve a mystery when a real ghost crashes the events of the 1970 "Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!" episode "A Night of Fright Is No Delight".
The four current voice actors who appear in current "Scooby-Doo" media reprise their roles for the episode: Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo and Fred Jones, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy Rogers, Grey Griffin as Daphne Blake, and Kate Micucci as Velma Dinkley.
The episode received critical acclaim for its humor, meta references, sense of nostalgia, and the natural fit between the two series.
Plot.
After stopping a plush dinosaur that comes to life in a pawn shop and attacks, the grateful owner gives Dean a new TV for free. While testing out the TV, the Winchesters are sucked into Dean's favorite episode ("A Night of Fright Is No Delight") of "Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!", followed soon after by Castiel. To the group's shock, they discover an actual ghost that begins killing people (including the real culprit Cosgood Creeps) and the Winchesters and the Scooby Gang are forced to team up together to stop it. Working together, the Winchesters and the Scooby Gang trap the ghost, who reveals himself to be a young boy who is being used by a greedy real estate developer in the real world to scare away reluctant shop owners. The ghost helps the Winchesters and Castiel fool the Scooby Gang into thinking that it was a human villain with the ghost boy turning into Cosgood Creeps before returning the Winchesters and Castiel to the real world. There, the three put the ghost to rest and get the criminal arrested for tax evasion. Before getting sucked into "Scooby-Doo", Castiel is shown to have gotten the fruit from the Tree of Life, bringing the Winchesters one step closer to their goal of opening a portal to Apocalypse World.
Production.
The idea of a crossover episode with "Scooby-Doo" had been discussed by the writers and producers of "Supernatural" for several years. The ability to do a crossover was made possible because the rights to both shows are owned by Warner Bros.
Reception.
The episode received critical acclaim. In her review for "Den of Geek", Bridget LaMonica gave the episode a score of 5/5, calling it a "milestone" and "a shameless dose of humor and nostalgia that found a way to blend two tonally different series." Samantha Highfill of "EW" echoed the sentiment and gave the episode an "A" grade, adding that "No other show could do this "and do it so well"." Kaitlin Thomas of "TVGuide" compared the episode favorably to past meta-installments "Changing Channels" and "The French Mistake" and said that it "is destined to become an instant classic."

Zbrojovka Z 9

The Zbrojovka Z 9 was a car produced by Československá Zbrojovka in the 1930s. First shown in 1929, the car had a conventional design, with a liquid-cooled two cylinder two stroke mounted at the front driving the rear wheels. In addition to a four door open top phaeton body, the car was also produced as a two-door to order, as both a roadster and a sedan, and a doorless pickup. In 1931, one car was raced across Europe, while another participated in the Monte Carlo Rally, although it did not finish. Production ran until 1932, with a total of 850 produced.
Design.
At the Prague Motor Show October 1929, Zbrojovka showed a slightly larger car than the Z 18 designed for a more upmarket customer. The car was put into production in 1930 as the Z 9 to replace the earlier vehicle. The Z 9 was of a conventional front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout, with drum brakes on all wheels, rigid axles, a three speed manual gearbox and a Gleason rear differential. Power was provided by a front-mounted, liquid-cooled, two cylinder two stroke engine with a bore of and stroke of . The car was equipped with a fuel tank, ran on a fuel to oil ration of 33:1 and had a 12V electric starter.
The basic body style was a four door open top phaeton which was available in black and cost 42,000 Kčs. The phaeton was long with a wheelbase of . It was wide and high. Curb weight was . The Z 9 was also available as a two door roadster by order and a two door Tudor sedan, which was high and available in dark blue and dark green. Other vehicles were fitted with bodies produced by third parties, including two door cabriolet and semi-cabriolet designs created by Fischer of Brno and Brožík of Plzeň, and a four door cabriolet produced by Sodomka. In addition to the various passenger car models, the Z 9 was produced as a doorless pickup.
The car was produced between October 1930 and June 1932, with a total of 850 vehicles manufactured of all body styles.
Performance.
The Z 9 could reach a top speed of and had a typical fuel consumption of between .
The car saw moderate success as a racing machine. Antonin Kahle and Rudolf Müttermüller completed a European cross-country race that started from Berlin in May 1931 and covered in ten countries from Portugal to Yugoslavia in a Z 9, finishing in June. The Kroup brothers were unsuccessful in their bid to win the 1931 Monte Carlo Rally, retiring after losing their way in fog near Lyon.
Production.
The car was produced between October 1930 and June 1932, with a total of 850 vehicles manufactured of all body styles.

Makhibaha is a historical village passing through so many years with many historic events. It is said that in later 14th century, Sree Sree Sankardev’s ancestor Gadadhar Bhuya was the "bhuya" of its nearby area. At that time it was surrounded by jungle and these jungles are full of bees which is in Assamese are called "mou-makhi" and so the name of the village is Makhibaha.
This village is under Tihu Police Station, Nalbari (Assam). The village is 90 km away from Guwahati, 20 km away from Nalbari, and 3 km away from Tihu Railway station. Pin code 781374.
There are 21 neighbouring chubas in Makhibaha. The population of Makhibaha is approximately 15,000. Most of people in this village depend upon agriculture. A large number of them are also engaged at government sectors and few in business.
Makhibaha has fifteen primary schools, one higher secondary school including both science and arts stream, one girls high school one venture high school, one Swaraswati Sikhu Niketan, one Jatiya Bidyalaya and one government technical school, B K S Motor Driving School.
The village is surrounded by Tihu in the north, Kshetri Dharmapur and Bhojkuchi in the south, Haribhanga in the east and Jalkhana in the west.

Chen-Kao reaction

The Chen-Kao reaction (named after Ko Kuei Chen and Chung-Hsi Kao, Madison, Wisconsin 1926) is a chemical method for determining the presence of Pseudoephedrine, Ephedrine, and similar phenylalkylamines.
The reaction is used in spot tests and is also known as Chen-Kao test (or simply as Chen, Test T in UN Precursor Test Kit). 
The test is often used to distinguish ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, Norephedrine, Cathinone and Methcathinone from Amphetamine and Methamphetamine,
which do not react with Chen’s test reagent.
Testing Method.
The Chen-Kao test is performed by creating an acidic solution of the compound to be tested and adding dilute Copper (II) Sulfate and Sodium hydroxide solutions.The procedure is as follows:
Further, the coordination complex might be extracted with organic solvent like Diethyl Ether or n-Butanol (see Table II), 
as proposed in the literature, which provides additional confirmation of the original results, but no further differentiation. 
This modification is not included in the UN Precursor Test Kit and other spot tests alike.
In order to further differentiate between ephedrine enantiomers - ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and other ephedrine-related compounds, Simon’s test (with acetaldehyde) and Simon’s test (with acetone) are used. (see Table III)
Reaction mechanism.
When acidic solution of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is mixed with copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide solutions, a violet color is formed. Upon shaking with ether, the organic phase turns red/purple and the aqueous phase turns blue. The staining is based on the formation of a coordination complex of two ephedrine molecules and a copper ion Cu2+
This works, because, in an alkaline solution, the hydroxyl and amine groups are de-protonated, leaving a negative charge on the central atoms. They can then form a coordination complex with the positively-charged cupric ions from the copper sulfate. Phenethylamines (and their derivatives) that have a β-ketone group will also react, but less predictably and dramatically (the carbonyl oxygen is less nucleophilic than the deprotonated hydroxyl group). They usually form a deeper blue color, and often a grey-ish precipitate. This includes the cathinones and presumably βK-2C-x compounds.
Description.
The execution of the Chen-Kao reaction is simple, needs little practice and limited skills. 
Also, the violet color obtained in the reaction is easy to define. 
For a correct execution, it is important to note that the typical colors develop relatively slowly, and that a good color intensity requires a sample of a few milligrams of the substances tested (i.e., more than what would typically be required for most other tests included in the UN test kits).
Of all ephedrine-related compounds, only ephedrine and pseudoephedrine produce the typical, stable violet color. Other ephedrine-related compounds produce a blue to greenish-blue precipitate. This precipitate could be seen as characteristic for the members of the ephedrine group other than pseudoephedrine and ephedrine itself, hence, the Chen-Kao test appears to show a significant specificity within the ephedrine group. However, it is known from previously published cross-testing work that various pharmaceuticals not related to the ephedrine group may produce similar blue copper complexes.
The two keto-amines, cathinone and methcathinone, initially also produce blue-colored complexes with the Chen-Kao reagent. However, a slow transition of the initial color into yellow, followed by an orange-brown color can be observed with both compounds, thus indicating the instability of the complexes initially formed, and an obvious decomposition of the two compounds under the alkaline conditions of this color reaction.
The results of the solvent extractions, summarized in Table II appear to add little novelty to the results of the original Chen-Kao reactions. However, in cases of doubts, they may serve as confirmatory steps.

Tan Xiaolin

Tan Xiaolin (; April 25, 1911 – August 1, 1948) was a Chinese composer.
He was born in Shanghai to parents from Kaiping, Guangdong. He composed works for Chinese instruments and several songs while studying music theory and the pipa at the Shanghai Conservatory. In 1939, he moved to the United States, where he did further studies with Paul Hindemith at Yale and the Oberlin College. He had won a John Day Jackson scholarship with his string trio (1945). He returned to Shanghai in 1946 to teach at the Conservatory. His pupils include Qu Xixian, Chen Peixun and Sang Tong. In 1948, he died in a hospital in Shanghai when he was only 37 years old.
Most of Tan's works in the Western classical music style are art songs and chamber works. His later pieces show the influence of Hindemith and his interest in aspects of neoclassicism. Some of his songs are published in "Tan Xiaolin gequ xuanji (A selection of songs by Tan)" (Beijing, 1982). Tan is regarded as one of the pioneers of the modern art music of China.

George Avery (professor)

George Avery (July 27, 1926 – March 5, 2004) was an American professor for German Studies at Swarthmore College.
Life.
After growing up in the Greek immigrant community of Philadelphia, he served in Germany as a soldier during World War II. His experience in Germany led to his deep interest in German culture. Immediately after the war, he participated in humanitarian efforts in Finland and Greece. After returning to the USA, he studied German at the University of Pennsylvania. He received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees there, as well as the Ph.D.
After a temporary teaching engagement at St. Joseph's University, he was hired by Swarthmore in 1959 and taught there until his retirement. He served as Chair of the Department of Modern Languages from 1975 to 1980. His student Jonathan Franzen portrayed Avery's endearing, if eccentric, manner of teaching in his memoirs.
Research.
Avery was specialized on German literature of the twentieth century, be it German, Swiss, or Austrian in origin. He published monographs and scholarly editions on the work of Robert Walser, Herwarth Walden and Karl Kraus. Avery received international recognition for his research on Walser. Andreas Kramer noted Avery's "meticulous notes and his commented index" regarding the correspondence between Karl Kraus and Herwath Walden, concluding that "Avery's edition [...] substantially contributes to our understanding of the wider cultural and social context of the German and Austrian avant-garde before 1914."

Because of their fear, he called for this meeting to eliminate them. At the same time, the tribal leader Puli Dora brings his pregnant daughter Gauri (S. Varalakshmi) to the court. Insulted, Gouri commits suicide in front of all. Puli Dora furiously says that he will take revenge. Vikram asks to arrest Pulidora, Vijayarayulu objects for this injustice and allows the tribals to go. Vikram arrests Vijayarayulu and sets fire to his palace. The Queen escapes with her son. Puli Dora helps Vijayarayalu to escape. Army commander Dharmadeva (Chittor V. Nagaiah) chases Puli Dora and Vijayarayalu. Puli Dora makes Dharmadeva believe that Vijayarayalu is dead and he changes himself as Rechukka. On Dharmadeva's way back, he finds Vijayarayalu's son and takes him to his house. Sumathi comes to know this and joins as a caretaker to the baby. The child is named as Vijay Kumar. After some time, Veera Raghava is blessed with a baby girl.

Wang Xin (artist)

Wang Xin (born 1983) is a Chinese artist whose artworks take the form of installations, moving images, and new media. She was born in Yichang, Hubei, China and currently lives and works in Shanghai. She graduated from China Academy of Art with a B.F.A. in 2007, then went on to earn her master's degree from the Art Institute of Chicago in 2011. In 2007, Xin received the Pierre Huber Creation Prize Award of Excellence. Galleries, artists, art agents, and artworks are often the subject of her work.
Xin is also a certified hypnotist and has explored using hypnosis in her art. With an interest in lucid dreaming, she has tried to use self-hypnosis to achieve these dreams. In 2014, Xin founded the 8HZ Hypnosis Lab in Imago Kinetics' Art Center in Hangzhou. 8ZH is an artistic project focusing on spontaneous inner vision by using hypnosis methods and experimenting with the possibilities of hypnosis in art. She is also the founder of The Gallery, an alternative art space/system.
Her work frequently uses language to challenge the status of the artist and the functioning of the art market. In 2016, Xin had a solo show at the de Sarthe Gallery called "Every Artist Should Have A Solo Show." Her works in this show were part of her "Rose-Color" series, which are about the art world and its systems. The colour pink is used to mark her artwork and projects related to these topics, because Xin feels that it matches the feeling of the art world. It also adds to the hypnotizing effect and gives a sense of fervency to her work. Some of her works include bold slogans about her own position and relation to the art world, which contain a sense of sarcasm or irony. Her second solo show, "The Must-See Art Show Where You Can Find 10,000 Artists," focuses on the structure of the art world through its institutions, systems, and dogma. Both exhibitions consisted of multiple interactive, site-specific installations that encouraged participation once visitors entered the gallery.
Other solo exhibitions from Xin include:

He graduated in 1870 at the Thomason Civil Engineering College, Burki, obtaining the gold medal for mathematics. The same year he was appointed to the Public Works Department of the Government of India and served at Dera Ghazi Khan and other locations in the Punjab.
In 1875 he was appointed Professor of Engineering at the Presidency College Calcutta, and in 1880, when the Engineering Department of that College was formed into an independent residential Engineering College at Sibpur, he took a leading part in its organisation, became one of the original members of its staff, and was eventually appointed Principal in 1891. He inaugurated a scheme of modern education for the District Schools of Bengal and Assam, and was responsible for the reorganisation of the technical schools of those two provinces. In 1897 he was for some months Inspector of Schools of the Rajshahi Division, and in 1901 officiated as head of the Educational Department of Bengal. In 1904 he was incapacitated by a serious illness which necessitated his retirement from India. 
He was responsible for teaching astronomy to the students of the Engineering College, and was always keenly interested in that science. In 1891, while on leave, he devised and patented an armillary sphere. He presented this to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1891. which he used for instructional purposes. 
After his retirement he devoted himself enthusiastically to an investigation of the pollen of plants, and prepared by micro-photography a very large number of enlarged photographs of pollen grains. The value of his work in this direction was recognised by the botanical authorities at Kew.

NGC 1052-DF2

NGC 1052-DF2 is an ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) in the constellation Cetus, which was identified in a wide-field imaging survey of the NGC 1052 group by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. It has been proposed that the galaxy contains little or no dark matter, the first such discovery. On 20 March 2019, a follow-up study announcing the discovery of a second UDG lacking dark matter, NGC 1052-DF4, was published.
Distance.
The distance to the galaxy from Earth obtained by an international team of researchers is 22.1 +/-1.2 Mpc. Due to close proximity, it is assumed to be associated with the elliptical galaxy NGC 1052 and to lie at a distance of about from NGC 1052.
On 3 June 2019, however, a separate team used a full observing dataset on the same object to review this claim, and found out that the actual distance of the galaxy was different, and that it may contain dark matter after all.
A more recent study on NGC 1052-DF2 suggests the previously reported distance of the galaxy was greatly exaggerated. Consequently, the galaxy now looks "normal" in every way. Using five independent methods to estimate distances of heavenly bodies, a team of researchers from the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) found the correct distance of NGC 1052-DF2 to be 42 million light years (13 MPc), not some 64 million light years (19 MPc) from the Earth. The total mass of the galaxy is around one-half of the mass estimated previously, but the mass of its stars is only about one-quarter of the previously estimated mass. This implies a significant part of NGC 1052-DF2 could be made up of dark matter, like any other galaxies.
Dark matter.
The apparent lack of dark matter in NGC 1052-DF2 may help prove that dark matter is real: If what appears to be dark matter is really just a currently unknown effect of the gravity of ordinary matter then this apparent dark matter should also appear in this galaxy. Further study will be needed before this and any other possible implications can be confirmed. If confirmed, the absence of dark matter may also have implications for theories of galaxy formation, as dark matter has been thought to be needed for galaxy formation.
A later study purports to show that the galaxy may contain more dark matter than initially reported. It may have a mass-to-light ratio towards the low end of expected values for a dwarf galaxy. However, a follow-up study on 20 March 2018 and a new discovery of a second ultra diffuse galaxy, NGC 1052-DF4, also apparently lacking dark matter, challenges the prior study's conclusion. In June 2021 further observations by Hubble have confirmed NGC 1052-DF2 as deficient in dark matter.
Other similar galaxies.
Astronomers discovered a second Galaxy with no dark matter, NGC 1052-DF4, which is another ultra diffuse galaxy - quite large, spread-out, and faint to observe. Discovering another galaxy with very little to no dark matter means the chances of finding more of these galaxies may be higher than cosmologists previously thought.
Another group of astronomers have found the existence of tidal tails in NGC 1052-DF4 indicating that the lack of dark matter has been caused by the interaction with a nearby neighbor (a low mass disk galaxy, NGC 1035). The interaction naturally explains the low content of dark matter inferred for this galaxy and reconciles these type of galaxies with our current models of galaxy formation.

Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavindrulu

Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavindrulu (also known as Rama Rao) (1875–1914) was an Indian poet, author, yogi, Sanskrit scholar and a philosopher. 
Ramaraya Kavi wrote nearly 148 classic works in Sanskrit . All but 45 are missing. While some are available in part, the remaining are available full length. 
Sanskrit scholars view Ramaraya Kavi as a strong proponent of "Advaita siddhanta" (theory) of Adi Shankara. His philosophical interpretations and dialectics of logical disputation of "Advaita" system of thought earned him the name "Apara Adi Shankara" which means—Ramaraya Kavi is another incarnation of Adi Shankara. 
Ramaraya Kavi was a Yogi from a very young age following his inititiation into spirituality by Lord Hayagreeva, as claimed by his first disciple Lanka Sundararama Sastri. 
Early life and education.
Ramaraya Kavi's earlier name was Rama Rao. He was born to Bellamkonda Mohan Rao and Hanumamba on 27 December 1875, in Pamidipadu in Andhra Pradesh. Though they were 6000 Niyogi Brahmins, they paradoxically embraced the Vaishnava cult headed by Sri Ramanuja Acharya.. As such, Rama Rao's family was also deeply religious and devoted to Lord Vishnu and pursuing "Vishishtadvaita".
Rama Rao lost his father at the age of 7 years. He had homeschooling and could not pursue higher education due to poor health. Sankaramanchi Lakshminarayana Sastri and Sankaramanchi Seetaramaiah taught him the Upanishads, "Namaka Chamakam" or "Sri Rudra Chamakam", "Vedas", etc. 
Rama Rao later continued his studies in "Mahabhashyam", "Vyakaranam" (Grammar), and "Tarkam" (logic) under Purighatla Rama Sastri, Bhagavatula Hari Sastri and Purighatla Subrahmanya Sastri. He learnt "Manorama", "Sabdendu Sekharamu", "Patanjali Bhashyam", etc. under Purighatla Rama Sastri. Initially, Rama Rao learnt up to "Siddhanta Kaumudi" to "Sandhi Panchakam" under Purighatla Rama Sastri. Based on this simple instruction, he ventured into writing a simplified commentary on "Siddhanta Kaumudi" entitled as "Saradratri", and "Kuvalayanandamu".
His biographer and first disciple Lanka Sundararama Sastri had written that Rama Rao was initiated into spirituality at the age of 14. As a consequence of his initiation into spiritual realm, Rama Rao has changed his name from 'Rao' to 'Raya'. Subsequently, in praise of the Lord Hayagreeva, he has written "Srimad Hayavadana Satakam," "Hayagreeva Ashtottara Satanamavali," "Sri Hayagreeva Sahasranamavali", "Hayagreeva Navaratnastuti" which are said to be rare and very difficult compositions in Sanskrit. Perhaps that is the reason, scholars argued, why Ramaraya Kavi himself had given commentaries to these poetic works.
Refuting Visishtadvaita.
Ramaraya Kavi's contribution to "Advaita Siddhanta", refuting Visishtadvaita, is said to be central to the Indian vaidic literature and spirituality. Though Ramaraya Kavi's family embraced the Vaishnava cult , his critical studies of "Sri Bhashyam" of Ramanuja and the commentary of Adi Shankara on the Bhagavad Gita had lent him deep insights into the gaping holes in the dialectics of Vishistadviata.
Ever since he turned into a complete "Smarta"by adopting "Advaita" of Adi Shankara. He did not stop there. In his commentaries on "Advaita", especially in his work "Sankaraasankara Bhasya Vimarsaha", he has proved wrong ten most important interpretations of Ramanuja's Sri Bhashyam.
Similar efforts of blasting Visishtadvaita continued in his later works such as "Siddhanta Sindhuhu." and "Vendanta Sangrahaha".
Uniqueness of Ramaraya Kavi's Literature.
According to Professor R.Balasubramanian and Revathy, Ramaraya Kavi's "Vedanta-Sangraha" is one of the fundamental and important texts on Advaita philosophy. It describes the basic theories and concepts of Vedanta. The interpretation and explanation of the text give us an insight into concepts like -"Tat-tvam-Asi-" of Advaita. It is also significant to note that Ramaraya Kavi has explained in detail the different technical terminologies of Vedanta used by the philosophers of that period, while establishing his own doctrines. They further added that Ramaraya Kavi belongs to the group of illustrious commentators on the basic texts and commentaries on Advaita Vedanta.
Professor K.S.R.Datta has written in his article "Ramaraya Kavi: A Modern Literary Giant" published in "Bhavan’s Journal" in 1977 : He was not only an original writer but also a commentator par excellence. His writings are marked by easy style, clarity of expression and vigour. His contributions to Advaita in particular and Sanskrit in general is immeasurable but this is not recognized by the scholars due to non-availability of his works, many of which were unfortunately lost or unpublished.Mellacheruvu Subrahmanya Saastri who rendered a number of Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi's works into Telugu has opined in his introduction to these books that Ramaraya Kavi is a poet whose depth of knowledge appears to be equal to a repository of millions of books. His ability to quickly grasp any given literary nuance of a spiritual text by offering new evidences and interpretations to the earlier texts is beyond anybody's imagination. Subrahmanya Saastri has not only extensively studied the works of Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi but also has written commentaries on "Paramatma Sahasranamavali", "Dasasloki", "SankarasankaraBhasya Vimarsanam", "Advaita Vijayamu", of Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi.
Death.
Ramaraya Kavi died following a brief illness in 1914 at the age of 39. 
The Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavindrulu Trust in Narsaraopet has published a number of Ramaraya Kavi's works in Telugu and Sanskrit and placed them in Google..

Fountain Bridge Halt railway station

Fountain Bridge Halt was a small halt which served the community of Rudry in Caerphilly, South Wales. It opened in 1908 and closed in 1956.
The halt was situated on the PC&amp;NR's Machen Loop Line, and as such, was served only by 'up' trains. Correspondingly, Waterloo Halt served the same community, though catered only for 'down' services.
The halt had a ground-level platform, and was provided with only a lamp and a name board. Passengers were confined to a gated enclosure behind the platform, which was unlocked by the conductor on the train's arrival. The halt closed in 1956 when passenger services (already reduced to three a day) were withdrawn. The line is still present, but the site is now overgrown, with the trackbed having become waterlogged, and the bridge over the River Rhymney just beyond the halt has long been dismantled.

Anthony Lejeune

Edward Anthony Thompson (7 August 1928 – 3 March 2018), known as Anthony Lejeune, was an English writer, editor, and broadcaster. He was known for his weekly radio talk "London Letter" that was broadcast in South Africa for nearly 30 years and for his crime novels and writing about the history of London's gentleman's clubs. He also produced a number of political books written from a conservative point of view. He was described by "The Times" as "always out of period, a misfit in the modern world for whom the term 'young fogey' might have been invented".
Early life and family.
Anthony Lejeune was born in Hendon on 7 August 1928 to the journalist and editor Edward Roffe Thompson, and Caroline Alice Lejeune, a film reviewer for "The Observer". He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood, and undertook his national service in the Royal Navy (March 1947 – June 1949), serving on and HMS "Drake". In 1949, he went to the University of Oxford, where he won the Newman Exhibition in Greek and English at Balliol College. He graduated with a first class degree in 1951. He took his mother's surname but never legally changed his name. He had close female friends but never married.
Career.
Lejeune was reading for the bar when he was offered the job of deputy editor of the literary review magazine "Time and Tide". He subsequently became the editor but left after the ownership of the magazine changed. He then worked at the "Daily Express", and through Ian Fleming, got a job as the crime correspondent for "The Sunday Times". He wrote a number of detective novels, six up to 1965 and three in the 1980s, and from 1953 reviewed detective stories for the Catholic weekly newspaper "The Tablet", although he was not Catholic himself. He recorded a weekly radio talk titled "London Letter" for the South African Broadcasting Company for nearly 30 years. He wrote a weekly column for "The Daily Telegraph" colour magazine in the 1970s and 1980s and was the London correspondent for New York's conservative "National Review" for over 40 years.
Lejeune produced a number of political books which were written from a conservative point of view. He edited Enoch Powell's "Income Tax at 4/3 In The £" and the collection "The Case For South West Africa" both of which were published by Tom Stacey. He also produced "Shadow Over Britain – An Examination of Labour Party Policy and Socialist Leaders" (1964) and "Socialized Medicine: Showcase of Failure" (1969). His best-remembered non-fiction is "The Gentlemen's Clubs of London" (1979) and "White's: The First Three Hundred Years" (1993) which drew on his knowledge of the London gentleman's club scene. He was a member of five such clubs which he described as "a peculiarly English institution".
In 1991 he edited a reader of his mother's film criticism and in 1998 he edited "The Concise Dictionary of Foreign Quotations" for Tom Stacey that was subsequently reissued in five different language volumes in 2007. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the novels of Rider Haggard.
Later life.
Lejeune was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2010 and resigned from his five clubs. He died from complications of the disease on 3 March 2018 and received obituaries in "The Times" and "The Daily Telegraph".

Bundwerk

Bundwerk is a method of building with timber that was used especially in the 19th century in Austria, South Tyrol and Bavaria. After log construction and timber framing, "bundwerk" is one of the most widespread forms of timber building techniques. It involved using wooden beams that were arranged partly in a lattice or diagonally over a cross. It often decorated the front and gable sides of agricultural buildings, frequently the grain barn or "Stadel" of quadrangular farms ("Vierseithöfen").
In northeastern Upper Bavaria "bundwerk" is especially varied and colourful. By contrast, in the Werdenfelser Land and the region around Innsbruck only a few places exhibit this type of timber building throughout.
"Bundwerk" had its heyday between 1830 and 1860 when artists and woodcarvers, as well as carpenters, decorated the "bundwerk" with paintings and carvings, often with mythical creatures or Christian symbols.

Abbey of St Martin, Autun

The Abbey of St. Martin is a former Benedictine monastery in Autun, Saône-et-Loire, France, to the northeast of the city just outside the city walls, on the right bank of the Arroux and to the north of the Roman road from Autun to Langres, Beaune and Besançon.
History.
The abbey was founded by Queen Brunhilda and the bishop of Autun, Saint Syagrius, in or around 589. Brunhilda was later buried there. The new foundation was richly decorated and furnished, largely with marbles, mosaics and other items which Brunhilde took from neighbouring Gallo-Roman buildings. The abbey was however largely destroyed in 731 by invading Saracens. It was not rebuilt until 870, and then destroyed again in 880, doubtless by the Normans. It was rebuilt again in 885 by Charles the Fat.
From 1058 it answered directly to the pope rather than to a bishop.
At the latest from the time of this rebuilding, the abbey was also fortified. In 1570, it was pillaged by the troops of Admiral de Coligny, the fortifications having fallen into disrepair. In 1589 the "États de Bourgogne" refused financial help to Nicolas Brulard, the then commendatory abbot, for the repair of the fortifications. The abbey was deserted soon afterwards and occupied by bandits: once they were expelled the fortifications were dismantled and the abbey left empty.
The vacant and dilapidated premises were taken over by the reformist Congregation of St Maur in 1635 (or 1654), who repaired them, but not the fortifications.
The abbey was entirely rebuilt between 1740 and 1752. It was suppressed in the French Revolution and sold off as national property in 1793, to be used as an armaments factory. A few years later it was almost entirely demolished apart from a few service buildings. The city authorities of Autun eventually acquired what remained and undertook restoration in 1976–77. The renovated buildings now operate under the name "Prieuré Saint-Martin" as a local government social centre, with rooms for hire.

Buchberger Leite

The Buchberger Leite is a gorge near Hohenau in the Lower Bavarian county of Freyung-Grafenau in Bavaria.
The gorge runs between Freyung and Ringelai.
As early as 1846 Bernhard Grueber and Adalbert Müller, in their book "Der bayrische Wald" wrote: "One shouldn't forget to visit the nearby Buchberg from Freyung, where the waters of the Ohe rush wildly through a gorge enclosed by vertical walls".
Here, after breaking through the rock formation of the Pfahl, the Wolfsteiner Ohe river carved up its way to 100 metres deep in the dark Pfahl slate rock of the "Buchberger Nebenpfahl".
The protected area of "Buchberger and Reschbachleite" (officially: "Schutz des Landschaftsteils Buchberger- und Reschbachleite, im Bereich der Gemeinden Freyung, Hohenau, Kumreut und Wasching, Landkreis Wolfstein") on 14 February 1961 has an area of 184 hectares. The white water gorge was designated in 2003 by the Bavarian Environment Ministry as one of the 100 mos beautiful geotopes in Bavaria. Further south its waters empty into the River Ilz.
At the westernmost of the two entrances into the gorge is the Freyung Carbide Works ("Carbidwerk Freyung"). In its vicinity lie the few remains of Neuenbuchberg Castle. This had been the seat of the Puchbergs since the 13th century but later went to the bishops of Passau. At the Carbide Works the trail runs through a short tunnel, cutting across a bend in the river.
Geotope.
The gorge is designated by the Bavarian State Office of the Environment (LfU) as a geo-scientifically valuable geotope (geotope no.: 272R003). It was assessed by the LfU with the official seal of approval to be included in the list of Bavaria’s most beautiful geotopes.

Veritable Records

Veritable Records are historical records compiled by government (court) historians of Chinese dynasties since the 6th century, and later in Korea, Japan and Vietnam which adopted the Chinese bureaucratic system and the writing system of Classical Chinese. Typically they were compiled immediately following the death of a monarch (preparations sometimes began while he was still alive) and follow a strictly prescribed format. Veritable Records are highly detailed and contain a wealth of political, economical, military, and biographical information.
Famous examples include (all written in Classical Chinese):
During the Yuan and Qing dynasties of China, Veritable Records were also written in Mongol and Manchu respectively.
Origin.
The earliest Veritable Records were those compiled under the direction of Zhou Xingsi (周興嗣, 469–521) for the reign of the Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502–549), but the practice of writing Veritable Records did not become standardized until the reign of the Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649), who was obsessed with his historical legacy.

Cracolândia

Cracolândia (literally "Crackland" in Portuguese) is a popular denomination for a region of the city of São Paulo, which is notorious for high incidence of drug trafficking and drug use in public. It is located within the central region of the city, near Luz Station.
Recent history.
Since 2005, the city hall has shut down bars and hotels associated with drug distribution and prostitution, displaced homeless people, and increased police presence with the intent to inhibit drug use in Cracolândia. Hundreds of building were designated as public utility in a 1.1 million square feet area, and were expropriated. The objective of the project was to increase the attractiveness of the region to private businesses.
In 2007, the São Paulo city hall launched a program named Nova Luz ("New Light" in Portuguese, referring to the broader region around Luz Station) in order to promote the execution of the planned changes to the region. Among the proposed measures were tax breaks, especially on real estate taxes, to stimulate the renewal of the facades of buildings, which are generally poorly maintained.
Critics of this program, however, claimed it to have a basis on social hygiene movements, highlighting that the renovations in buildings, parks, and streets were not accompanied by assistance towards the vulnerable groups who inhabit or work in the region, who are being effectively removed. The homeless are displaced, trash collectors have their job put in jeopardy, and crack users and dependents are left without a place to gather, being left to wander adjacent and otherwise nearby neighborhoods.

<doc id="56981586" url="?curid=56981586" title="Mederic (monk)">
Mederic (monk)

Saint Mederic or Medericus, also known in French as Saint Merri or Médéric (died 29 August 700), was a monk and a hermit, who is considered patron saint of the right bank of the river Seine in central Paris.
Early life.
Born into an illustrious family in the Morvan near Autun, he was offered at the age of 13 as an oblate at the Abbey of St. Martin, Autun. He receives an education of prayer, obedience and chastity. The oblate crowned with flowers, double symbol of innocence and sacrifice, was led to the church surrounded by his relatives and their friends. The religious assembled in the choir prayed for the one whom their adoption would initiate to the labors and the joys of a new family. The celebrant began the divine service and called on his head the grace of Christ. After the gospel, the oblate approached the altar carrying a host and a chalice with a little wine which the priest received as a deposit to the Lord. His father or his parents wrapped his hand and offering in the altar cloth, which was spread over him as a sign of adoption by the Church. After warning the child of the austerities of the monastic life, he read to him the rule of St. Benedict and the parents pledged for him. His hair was shaved and he put on the monks' cucula. He was no longer entitled to the paternal inheritance. Around the age of 15, he was allowed to make a profession. Wealthy parents made an offering to the monastery.
Career.
Mederic astonished the fifty of his classmates by the observance of a rigorous discipline. Barley bread dipped in water was his only food, which he only took twice a week. His eyes still fixed on the Crucifix, he was wearing a hair shirt under his coat. He lived thus for several years, hiding from the other monks. But his reputation for holiness passed the doors of the convent, and celebrity came to fetch him at the end of the cloister.
Herald, abbot of Saint-Martin, having died about 680, it is quite naturally that the brothers elected him, following the advice of the bishop of Autun, Hermenarius, who recommended them to choose a pastor able to save the flock of the Christ of the Wolf Tooth. After three days of fasting the monks assembled at the church, sang the Mass of the Holy Ghost, intoned the Veni Creator, and proceeded to the election of their abbot by designating Mederic unanimously. The crowd ran to the monastery. The bishop, hearing him proclaimed from the top of the ambo, addressed the new abbot: "Flambeau du Christ, vase d'élection du trésor divin, reçois la mesure dispensatoire du Dieu éternel pour nourrir les troupeaux du créateur. Instruis-les par tes conseils et tes préceptes et mérites d'entendre ces paroles du juge miséricordieux : O bon fidèle serviteur, parce que tu as été fidèle en peu de choses, je t'établirai sur beaucoup d'autres, entre dans la joie de ton Seigneur" (Math.25.11)
The more he was raised, the more he faded away. This new life soon weighed on him. His many miracles attracted the crowds. No longer finding in this place peace and deep communion with God, Mederic decided to withdraw into the solitude of the forest of Morvan to finally be alone with God. He built a cell there some distance from Autun but this secret was quickly broken because the monks, plunged in sadness by his disappearance, went in search of him. Mederic not wanting to follow them, they asked the bishop who, threatening excommunication, managed to get him back to the monastery.
Later life.
Among his clergy the young monk Frodulphe, also known as Saint Frou, was close to the master who had held him on the baptismal font and had educated himself to raise him to the highest degrees of perfection. Frodulphe, enamored of solitude like his master, proposed to him a pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Denis and Saint Germain, their compatriot, abbot of the Abbey of St. Symphorian, Autun, before becoming bishop of Paris.
The two monks took the road to Paris and on the way they multiplied the miracles. The aging Mederic had great difficulty in making this journey on foot, and fell ill on arriving at the Collegiate Church of Saint-Martin de Champeaux, near Melun, where they stopped for several months. The two men spent long hours praying in the church. Sometimes they went to Melun to exercise charity; hearing some of the prisoners moaning from the depths of their cell, Mederic moved his heart and asked God for their deliverance. The doors of the prison opened on their own. His cure delayed, he left the monastery of Champeaux. The people came to make him many gifts which he hastened to distribute to the poor.
Halfway to Paris, he cures a poor man's fever answering to the name of Ursus. A woman named Bénédicte recovered health through her intercession. Arrived at Bonneuil-sur-Marne where he learns that two thieves were in chains, he asks God for his intercession and obtains the release of the two men. On the side of Charenton-le-Pont, he delivered another criminal who had broken the bridge. He was again forced to stop by fatigue. It was in this uninhabited place that a chapel was erected to honor its memory, and that some houses were grouped around the building which was at the origin of the village of Saint-Méry, in the diocese of Paris. They decided to make a detour to go to the tomb of Saint Denis and stopped at Thomery. Mederic arrived in Paris. It was near the church of Saint-Pierre-des-Bois that he found refuge in a cell open day and night to the prayers of passers-by. He rested his body broken by fatigue and illness. There, living in recluse, he served God for two years and nine months after having accomplished with joy the purpose of his pilgrimage and kneeling in the church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés at the tomb of the illustrious abbot of the Abbey of St. Symphorian of Autun.
Feeling his coming end, the 18th of the calends of September, he died in peace surrounded by many of his disciples. He was buried in St. Peter's Chapel. His tomb was the object of true veneration as miracles took place and Charles the Bald established a cult in his honor. This church was later too small and, falling into ruins, it was rebuilt and transformed into a basilica by Odon the Falconer. Thibert, priest in 884, solicited Gozlin, bishop of Paris, to translate it.
The bones of the saint were raised and placed above the altar in a silver shrine enriched with precious stones and supported by two angels. Adalard, former Count of Autun, made for the occasion rich gifts to the new church which was placed under the name of St. Peter and St. Merry. The Abbey of Champeaux, formerly illustrated by its presence, received a portion of its relics; the abbey of St. Martin in Autun founded a solemn Mass in his honor. Left alone, Frodulphe returned to St. Martin.
Veneration.
The Church of Saint-Merri in Paris is named after him.

The thickback sole occurs in the northeast Atlantic, from Great Britain and Ireland south to the Baie du Lévrier in Senegal, they are also found around Madeira. In the Mediterranean Sea, this species can be found throughout the basin except for the coasts of the Levantine Sea.
Habitat and biology.
This species is benthic on sea beds consisting of sand and mud, preferring coarse sand. on the continental shelf and slope, at depths between 80–400 m. It feeds on a wide range of small benthic organisms, largely crustaceans such as amphipods and shrimp, also polychaetes and bivalves. The spawning season runs from early March to early summer in the English Channel but from late winter and spring to early autumn off Ireland. They can live for up to 14 year. The young thickback sole develop in open-sea nurseriesand settle into a benthic mode at a relatively young age compared to common sole and this may be why they are rarely recorded in coastal waters.
Fisheries.
The thickback sole is not utilized in fisheries in the central eastern Atlantic but in the Mediterranean it is a commercially exploited species and is regularly observed in markets in Morocco, the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Adriatic Sea. Elsewhere it is not common in markets. The flesh is highly esteemed and is marketed both fresh and frozen.
The average depth of commercial trawls in the Atlantic is between 35m and 200m and this could mean that thickback soles are caught in a significant amount as bycatch and that most are discarded, the effects of this bycatch on the population is not known. The commercial fisheries for thickback sole in the Mediterranean uses trawls, gill and trammel nets.

Frodulphe

Frodulphe de Barjon, known as St. Frou, born in the seventh century at Autun, and died in the eighth century at Barjon, is a religious and holy French Catholic, disciple of Saint Mederic, patron saint of the right bank.
Early life.
Placed as an oblate at the Abbey of St. Martin, Autun, Frodulphe de Barjon learns prayer, meditation, and penance. It was under his abbacy that Saint Mederic made him his disciple and his friend; he had kept it on the baptismal font and devoted himself to his education. When St. Merry left the monastery to take refuge in the solitude of the great woods of the Morvan, surely he was one of those who went in search of him and found him, begged him to return to take care of them. Not having succeeded, he was surely brothers who went to fetch the bishop of Autun, Ansbert, to bring him back to the heart of his monastery [ref. necessary]. Once back home, life resumed.
Frodulphe de Barjon accompanied his master on his journey to Paris, about 696, on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Denis, and met their compatriot Germain de Paris, who was formerly abbot of the abbey of Saint-Symphorien d'Autun. On the way, he stopped at the Collegiate Church of Saint-Martin de Champeaux in Brie, near Melun, Merry being sick. They had made this long journey on foot. Having left for Paris, the two men stopped at Bonneuil-sur-Marne and Charenton-le-Pont, the Abbe Merry multiplying the number of miracles on his way. Having settled again in a solitary place, some faithful grouped themselves and thus was born in the hamlet of Saint-Méry. Deciding to collect themselves also on the tomb of Saint Denis, they made a stop at Thomery.
Arriving in Paris, they discovered, in a small wood, on what was formerly the island Saint-Martin, in the marsh, a small chapel near the church of Saint-Pierre-des-Bois, where they decided to stay. They stayed there for two years and nine months. It is in this hermitage that his companion died on August 29, 700. Frodulphe de Barjon returned to Burgundy and became abbot of the monastery of St. Martin, which he left when the Saracens of General Ambiza sacked Autun on August 22, 725, and retired as a hermit in the solitude of Barjon.
Part of his body was repatriated to Paris to be buried near his master in St. Peter's Chapel. Bones of his body are preserved in a reliquary of gilded wood in the parish church of Saint-Philibert in Trouhaut (Côte-d'Or)

Shanay-Timpishka

The Shanay-Timpishka, also known as La Bomba, is a tributary of the Amazon River, called the "only boiling river in the world". It is long. It is known for the very high temperature of its waters—from to nearly . The name means 'boiled by the heat of the sun', though the source of the heat is actually geothermal.
Location and Mythology.
The river is located in the Mayantuyacu sanctuary, part of the Huánuco high forest. The area is inhabited by an Asháninka community. Local shamans believe that the boiling water is birthed by Yucamama, a giant serpent spirit known as the "Mother of the Waters."
Scientific Explanation.
Andrés Ruzo, a geothermal scientist, has investigated the source of the heat. He initially learned of it as a child from his grandfather. The river maintains its high temperature despite not being near any known active volcanoes or geothermal vents, which normally provide geothermal heating for groundwater. Despite its unique nature, National Geographic has described it as an entirely natural feature: a non-volcanic, geothermal feature flowing at anomalously high rates. The predominant theory for the source of this heat is from the geothermal gradient of the Earth. Being closer to the Earth's mantle, underground water tends to be of a higher temperature than surface water. The theory is that rainwater falls onto the surface of the Amazon Rainforest and finds deep-rooted faults where it travels down into the crust. The water is thus heated in accordance with the geothermal gradient. It is then likely fed to the surface of the Earth through fault-fed hot springs that act to heat up the river along its stretch.
Threats.
The Shanay-Timpishka faces threats from deforestation. According to National Geographic, it is in fact the local native population which carries out most of the deforestation around the area. Up to ninety nine percent of deforestation around the Boiling River being caused by locals selling the larger and more expensive trees, then clear burning the rest. A local oil and gas company called Maple Energy has in fact taken to protecting some of the jungle around the area.

Guillaume de Vienne

Guillaume de Vienne, sometimes identified as Guillaume VI de Vienne (died 18 February 1407), was a French prelate, archbishop of Rouen from 1389.
Family.
Originally from Burgundy, he was the son of Guillaume de Vienne, lord of Roulans, and his wife Claude (Marguerite) née de Chaudenay. One of his sisters, Jeanne, was the mother of Jean de Nant, archbishop of Vienne (14051423), then of Paris (14231426). Another sister, Marguerite, married, firstly, Robert de Saint-Beuve, knight and lord of Saint-Beuve, then, secondly, Georges, lord of Clères. His brother was the Admiral of France Jean de Vienne (died 1396) and his uncle was Jean de Vienne (died 1382), archbishop of Besançon.
Biography.
Guillaume was a monk in the Abbey of St Martin, Autun, of which he became abbot. Around 1375, he became the abbot of Saint-Seine, a position he held until 1379.
He was named bishop of Autun on 13 February 1379 by bulls of Pope Clement VII and was appointed bishop of Beauvais on 26 August 1387. He was not there long, as on 29 March 1389 he was named archbishop of Rouen, although he did not take possession of the archdiocese before November 1389 (the "Gallia Christiana" dates his solemn entry to 1393; he was however present at the manor of Déville as of August 1389).
He attended the first embassy with the new Pope Benedict XIII in 1394. He was also present at the convent of the Celestines of Avignon during the burial of Clement VII in September 1401. He celebrated mass in the Sainte-Chapelle at the coronation of Queen Isabeau of Bavaria, wife of King Charles VI of France. He was also present in Rouen during the translation of the relics of Saint Louis.
He died on 18 February 1407 in the "hôtel" of the archbishops of Rouen in Paris and was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Seine in an imposing tomb with a recumbent effigy.

Ponerorchis faberi is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to south-central China (Sichuan, north-west Yunnan, north-east Guizhou).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described by Robert Allen Rolfe in 1982 as "Habenaria faberi", although he later transferred it to "Gymnadenia". It was later transferred again to "Amitostigma". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with "Amitostigma faberi" becoming "Ponerorchis faberi".

The Gulf of Gorgan (), also known as Gorgan Bay, is the largest gulf in the Caspian Sea. It is located at the south-eastern shore of the Caspian Sea near the cities of Behshahr, Gorgan and Sari in Iran and is separated from the main water body by the Miankaleh peninsula and extends until the Ashuradeh peninsula.
The gulf and the peninsula form a wetland of about 100,000 ha with a maximum depth of 2 m in the bay. The elevation varies between 18 m and 25 m below sea level.
Due to evaporation and lack of water inflow, the gulf and the marshland suffer from increasing silting, with adverse effect to local marine life and economy. Inflow of freshwater from rivers such as the Qarasu reduces salinity, with the additional effect of the water becoming muddier. According to a member of the Caspian Sea National Research Center, the gulf will have vanished by 2025 " if no efficient remedial measure is adopted".

Andrew R. Barron

Andrew R. Barron (born 20 May 1962) is a British chemist, academic, and entrepreneur. He is the Sêr Cymru Chair of Low Carbon Energy and Environment at Swansea University, and the Charles W. Duncan Jr.-Welch Foundation Chair in Chemistry at Rice University. He is the founder and director of Energy Safety Research Institute (ESRI) at Swansea University, which consolidates the energy research at the University with a focus on environmental impact and future security. At Rice University, he leads a Research Group and has served as Associate Dean for Industry Interactions and Technology Transfer.
Most of Barron's work has revolved around the study of nanoparticles and their applications. Early on, he studied how the structure of a molecule could overcome thermodynamic control and create new solid state structures. Some of his early work also dealt with alumoxanes and ceramic nanomaterials. In the early 2000s, his research began to focus on carbon nanomaterials, the functionalization of fullerenes and single walled carbon nanotubes. Later, application of nanotechnology to energy problems became the focal point of his work. He has authored over 440 papers and 6 books, including a book co-authored with his wife, Merrie Barron, entitled "Project Management for Scientists and Engineers".
Barron is the co-founder of Oxane Materials and Natcore Technology. He was a co-founder of the Rice Alliance.
Barron has received several awards for his research and work. He received the Humboldt Senior Scientist Research Award in 1997, the Welch Foundation Norman Hackerman Award in Chemical Research in 2002 and the Lifetime Achievement Award by Houston Technology Center in Nanotechnology in 2011. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.
Early life and education.
Barron was born in Welwyn Garden City, and brought up in Farnham, Surrey. In 1983, Barron completed his BSc in Chemistry from Imperial College. Subsequently, he received his PhD degree in 1986 from Imperial College under the supervision of Geoffrey Wilkinson.
After completing his PhD, Barron moved to the United States and joined University of Texas at Austin for his post-doctoral research, which dealt with the chemistry of multiple bonds to phosphorus and carbon. He published the first structural characterization of a C≅P triple bond in 1988 in a paper he co-authored with Alan Cowley. In 1987, he joined Harvard University as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1991. Barron founded Gallia inc. in 1992 and became Chairman of its Scientific Advisory board.
Later career.
Barron left Harvard University in 1995, when he joined Rice University as professor of Chemistry and Materials Science. He stepped down from his position at Gallia in 1997. In 1998, he was appointed as the Charles W. Duncan Jr.-Welch Foundation Chair in Chemistry at Rice University.
Following his studies on ceramic nanoparticles and the discovery of their applications, he founded Oxane Materials in 2002. The company developed nanoproducts with applications in the field of energy. Building on his research with nanoparticles, Barron founded Natcore Technology in 2004 and joined the scientific advisory board of the company. The company manufactures nanoparticles and technology with applications in the solar sectors.
From 2006 to 2008, he served as the Associate Dean of Industry Interactions and Technology Transfer at the institute. In 2013 he was appointed as the Sêr Cymru Chair of Low Carbon Energy and Environment, College of Engineering, Swansea University. He taught as a visiting professor for one year at University of Wales in 2009. Barron has served as a board member of the Houston Clean Energy Park. His research in the field of energy resulted in the foundation of Energy Safety Research Institute, which he leads, at Swansea University. The vision of the Energy Research Safety Institute (ESRI)and Swansea University is "building the bridge to a sustainable, affordable and secure energy future."
Barron is the editor of Journal of Nanomaterials since 2013 and Scientific Reports since 2014. He is also part of the editorial boards of Main Group Chemistry and Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing. Barron has served on the advisory board of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Zhu Zhou International Research Institute China, and Yellow River Delta Efficient Eco-economic Development.
Research.
Molecular control over solid state structure.
In the early 1990s, Barron developed interest in studying how the structure of a molecule could overcome thermodynamic control and create new solid state structures. As such, he synthesized a class of cubic Gallium chalcogenide compounds and showed that a new meta-stable phase could be synthesized.
Alumoxanes.
Following from his work on the chalcogenides, Barron was the first person to crystallographically characterise an alumoxane in 1993. These structures were spectroscopically consistent with methylalumoxane and he showed that despite being octet molecules they had significant Lewis acidity, he termed this as “Latent Lewis acidity”, and showed that this mechanism applied to a number of MAO style polymerization systems. Barron's model has been evolved by others but is essentially the same as now widely accepted.
Ceramic nanomaterials.
While investigating MAO-like structures, Barron noticed the relationship between clusters and minerals, at the same time he became interested in metalloxane polymers. He determined that these "polymers" were actually nanoparticles. Furthermore, he showed that these metal oxide nanoparticles could be chemically made by a top-down approach from mineral with which they shared their structures. With the ability to make a range of nanoparticles with different functional groups and control over size, Barron found that the structure and physical properties of macroscopic materials could be controlled by alterations at the nanometer scale.
Barron was the first to discover that nanoparticle derived ceramics could be designed to have intra-granular porosity, meaning that the pores are within the crystal grain rather than between the crystal grains as normally observed. This had implications in composites and in membranes and separation processes. Through his research, Barron developed a process that forms hollow spheres of ceramic with exceptional crush strength.
Barron rationalized that if hollow ceramic spheres could be made on a large scale they could replace dense ceramics being used in oil extraction and minimize waste. He created a spin-of company to commercialize this technology. In 2010, Barron and his team, on the request of U.S. Navy, developed a ceramic membrane with microscale pores that could filter out contaminants from waters and protect divers' wet suits without getting blocked.
Carbon nanomaterials.
Barron investigated the impact of a fullerene on wide range of systems. Initial work was concerned with the toxicity on various cell types. The results of this work demonstrated that inclusion of C60 into a peptide structure drastically lowered any toxicity effects.
In his latest work, Barron has studied catalysis with growth of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). He pioneered the concept of amplification of a CNT.
Environmental research.
In mid 2010s, Barron returned to the issue of water purification. He has investigated the nano control over the surface of a material that allows for the creation of both super hydrophilic surfaces that allow for separation of oil and water without fouling. In this area, his research has been focused on energy problems including sustainable resources and waste recovery, reducing the impact of hydrocarbon energy sources, carbon dioxide valorisation and long-term sequestration and the next generation of the energy distribution.
Personal life.
Barron lives with his wife, Merrie Barron, in both Swansea (Wales) and Houston (Texas). Since he moved to Texas in 1990s, he has participated in motor racing as a sport. In 1999 American Lemans Series, he was team principle for team in the GTS class. He participated in the final season of USRRC under Ross Racing. Barron has previously raced Lotus Seven, Caterham Seven, and Lotus Type 61 Formula Ford. He has been SW Division SCCA E-Production Champion, 2013 Monoposto Formula Ford Champion, 2013 SVRA Group 2 Sprint Series Champion and 2014 Monoposto Formula Ford Champion. In 2018, he raced FIA Formula Opel Racing with a Formula Vauxhall Lotus.

Bloody Christmas Eve in Ochotnica Dolna

Bloody Christmas Eve in Ochotnica Dolna – symbolic name given to pacification of the Ochotnica Dolna village (currently Lesser Poland voivodeship, Nowy Targ County), made by German Occupiers in the last months of World War II. 23 of December 1944 members of SS murdered 56 residents of Ochotnica Dolna and partially burnt the village. The name "Bloody Christmas Eve" refers to Eve of the Christmas, that previously was celebrated on 23rd of December. 
The course of pacification.
On December 22, 1944, Germans arrived in Ochotnica Dolna, who within the so-called the food campaign robbed the village. Despite the opposition of the local residents, a group of Soviet partisans attacked German soldiers, killing two of them, including non - commissioned SS-Unterscharführer Bruno Koch.
The next day, about 200 SS men came from Krościenko with six cars. The Germans ran into the homes, demanding money first and then murdering people. Children were thrown alive in the fire or brutally murdered.
The Germans wanted to burn and plunge the next village Ochotnica Górna, but the snow was too heavy and their cars were not able to travel up the hill.
Executioners.
The crime in Ochotnica Dolna was made on December 23 by the SS (SS-Kampfgruppe Jagdkommando Matingen) criminal special order under the command of SS-Untersturmführer der Waffen-SS Albrecht C. Matingen (number SS 338 969). This division consisted of soldiers of various nationalities. It was created in mid-1944 from members of the Waffen-SS and police in Montelupich prison in Krakow. Most of them were SS men from the 3rd SS Panzer Division "Totenkopf" and the 4th SS "Polizei" Panzergrenadier Division, volksdeutsche from Poland, Russia and Ukraine. The company was stationed from the autumn of 1944 at the school in Krościenko.
Albrecht C. Matingen (born June 3, 1920, died October 23, 1974) lived in West Germany after the war. Neither he nor any of his unit members was ever convicted of crimes committed in Poland.
Victims.
According to the list of deaths registered by the Civil Registry Office (Parish Office) in Ochotnica Dolna on December 23, 1944, 56 people were murdered, including 19 children, 21 women. In almost two hours, almost all members of the families of Chlipałów, Rusnaków, Brzeźne and Karczewski were murdered. A fire station, a folk house and 32 farms burned down .
The pacification of Ochotnica was one of the bloodiest German repressive actions in Podhale.
Memory.
The martyrdom of the village was commemorated by the memorial designed by Henryk Burzec, erected in 1964 in the center of Ochotnica Dolna, showing 20-year old Maria Kawalec, who is holding her small child next to her chest. After shooting her husband, Maria jumped out of the window with her son in her arms. The first bullet hit the child in the forehead and the other pierced the mother's shovel and jaw. Maria sat under the willow tree and not letting go of the child, she froze in this position. You can see she was trying to protect the child from the bullets holding her hand up in the air.
The commemorative cross dedicated to these events also stood, among other crosses, at the Sanctuary of the Martyrdom of the Polish Countryside located in Michniów, where one of the largest pacification of villages in Polish territories during the occupation took place.

Estriol (medication)

Estriol (E3), sold under the brand name Ovestin among others, is an estrogen medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone which is used in menopausal hormone therapy. It is also used in veterinary medicine as Incurin to treat urinary incontinence due to estrogen deficiency in dogs. The medication is taken by mouth in the form of tablets, as a cream that is applied to the skin, as a cream or pessary that is applied in the vagina, and by injection into muscle.
Estriol is well-tolerated and produces relatively few adverse effects. Side effects may include breast tenderness, vaginal discomfort and discharge, and endometrial hyperplasia. Estriol is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. It is an atypical and relatively weak estrogen, with much lower potency than estradiol. When present continuously at adequate concentrations however, estriol produces full estrogenic effects similarly to estradiol.
Estriol was first discovered in 1930, and was introduced for medical use shortly thereafter. Estriol esters such as estriol succinate are also used. Although it is less commonly employed than other estrogens like estradiol and conjugated estrogens, estriol is widely available for medical use in Europe and elsewhere throughout the world.
Medical uses.
Estriol is used in menopausal hormone therapy to treat menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, vulvovaginal atrophy, and dyspareunia (difficult or painful sexual intercourse). The benefits of estriol on bone mineral density and osteoporosis prevention have been inconsistent and are less clear. Estriol has been found to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and other urogenital symptoms. A combination of estriol and lactobacilli as a dual estrogen and probiotic has been marketed for the treatment of vaginal atrophy and urinary tract infections.
Available forms.
Estriol is available in oral tablet, vaginal cream, and vaginal suppository forms. It is also available over-the-counter or from compounding pharmacies in the form of topical creams. The medication is available both as estriol and in the form of estriol ester prodrugs such as estriol succinate, estriol acetate benzoate, and estriol tripropionate, as well as the polymeric ester prodrug polyestriol phosphate.
Estriol was originally marketed in the 1930s in the form of oral capsules containing 0.06, 0.12, or 0.24 mg estriol under the brand names Theelol (Parke-Davis) and Estriol (Lilly, Abbott). Subsequently, many decades later, oral tablets containing 0.35, 1, or 2 mg estriol were introduced under brand names such as Gynäsan, Hormomed, Ovestin, and Ovo-Vinces.
Contraindications.
General contraindications of estrogens include breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and others. In animals, estriol is contraindicated during pregnancy and in ferrets.
Side effects.
Estriol is well-tolerated and produces relatively few adverse effects. Breast tenderness may sometimes occur as a side effect of estriol. Local reactions with vaginal estriol such as discomfort (irritation, burning, itching) and discharge may occur. Estriol may produce endometrial hyperplasia similarly to estradiol and other estrogens, and hence should be combined with a progestogen in women with intact uteruses to prevent this risk. However, it appears that typical clinical dosages of vaginal estriol are not associated with an important risk of endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia. As such, combination with a progestogen may not be needed in the case of vaginal estriol. Some studies suggest that this may also be true for oral estriol. However, dosage and frequency of administration, as well as meal consumption, may be determining factors as to whether or not estriol produces endometrial proliferation.
Overdose.
Estrogens and other steroids are relatively safe in acute overdose. Estriol has been assessed in single oral doses of up to 75 mg. General symptoms of estrogen overdose in humans may include nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, and reversible feminization. While there are no known studies describing the acute toxicity of estrogen overdose in dogs, this species is known to be more sensitive to the toxic effects of estrogens than humans and other animals. The most serious short-term adverse effect of estrogens in dogs is bone marrow suppression and consequent pancytopenia, which can be life-threatening.
Interactions.
Interactions with estriol might be expected to be similar to those of estradiol. No interactions with estriol have been reported in animals. However, it should not be used in combination with other drugs that suppress bone marrow production in dogs.
Pharmacology.
Pharmacodynamics.
Estriol is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. In terms of relative binding affinities (RBA) for the ERs compared to estradiol, it was found in one study to possess 11 to 14% of the RBA for the human ERα and 18 to 21% of the RBA for the human ERβ. Its relative transactivational capacities at the ERs compared to estradiol were 11% at ERα and 17% at ERβ. In addition to being a ligand of the classical nuclear ERs, estriol is an antagonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a membrane estrogen receptor (mER), at high concentrations (~1,000–10,000 μM). This is in contrast to estradiol, which is an agonist of this receptor. Like other estrogens, estriol does not importantly interact with other steroid hormone receptors.
Estriol is a much less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and is somewhat weak and atypical in its properties. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. With clinical use, estriol is said to be weakly estrogenic in certain tissues, such as the liver and endometrium, but produces pronounced and full estrogenic responses in the vaginal epithelium. The medication has been found to reduce hot flashes, improve vaginal atrophy, reverse the postmenopausal decline in skin thickness and collagen content, suppress gonadotropin secretion, and produce proliferation of breast epithelium. Conversely, estriol does not consistently affect bone resorption or fracture risk, does not seem to increase breast density, and, at oral doses of 2 to 4 mg/day, does not affect liver proteins, lipid metabolism, or hemostatic parameters. Additionally, vaginal estriol does not appear to produce endometrial proliferation or increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, and some studies have found this to be the case for oral estriol as well. On the other hand, it appears that estriol may be able to stimulate the growth of active breast cancer. In rodents, estriol induces mammary gland development similar to that with estrone. By the oral route in women, estriol has approximately 30% of the potency of estradiol in terms of hot flashes relief and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, and about 20% of the potency of estradiol on stimulation of liver production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. A study of ovulation inhibition by estrogens in women found that prevention of ovulation occurred with 5 mg/day oral estriol in only 1 of 7 cycles. Due to its differing effects from those of estradiol, estriol may be considered a safer estrogen in certain regards.
The weak and atypical estrogenicity of estriol is thought to be related to its short duration in the body and hence the fact that it stays bound to the ER for a relatively short amount of time. Whereas estradiol remains bound to the ER for 6 to 24 hours with a single short-acting injection, estriol dissociates from the receptor much more rapidly and stays bound for only 1 to 6 hours. As a result, estriol can only induce estrogenic effects which require short-term interaction with the ERs. Induction of endometrial mitoses requires the ligand to remain bound for at least 9 to 12 hours, and this is thought to be responsible for the lack of endometrial proliferation with estriol in many studies. If estriol is delivered more continuously than a single administration per day however, for instance if it is given as a subcutaneous pellet, as a depot injection, or in multiple doses two or three times per day, this results in more sustained exposure to estriol and full estrogenic responses equivalent to those of estradiol occur. For these reasons, estriol has been described as a "short-acting" estrogen and it has been said that descriptors like "weak" and "impeded" are inaccurate. Consumption of food after oral administration of estriol also results in more prolonged exposure to estriol, due to enterohepatic recycling and resurgences in estriol levels. As such, if avoidance of endometrial hyperplasia or other full estrogenic effects is intended, it may be preferable to take estriol in a single dose, as low as possible, once per day at night before bedtime.
Although estriol is an estrogen, it has also been reported to have mixed agonist–antagonist or partial agonist activity at the ERs. On its own, it is said to be weakly estrogenic, but in the presence of estradiol, it has been found to be antiestrogenic. However, this is again due to the fact that estriol is a "short-acting" estrogen. If estriol is present continuously with estradiol, it shows no antagonism of estradiol. The co-administration of estriol with estradiol has been found not to influence the effects of the latter in women, including neither enhancing nor antagonizing the effects of estradiol.
Pharmacokinetics.
Absorption.
Estriol has significant bioavailability, but its potency is limited by rapid metabolism and excretion and its relatively weak estrogenic activity. With oral administration, during first-pass metabolism, a considerable portion of estriol is conjugated via sulfation into estriol sulfate and rapidly excreted. Only about 10 to 20% of a dose of estriol remains in the circulation, and of this, only about 1 to 2% is present in its active, unconjugated form. Peak levels of estriol occur about 1 to 3 hours after an oral dose. Similarly to the case of progesterone, taking oral estriol with food greatly enhances its absorption. In addition, due to enterohepatic recycling, consuming a meal 4 hours after taking oral estriol can produce a second peak in estriol levels. Dosages of oral estriol of 4 to 10 mg have been found to result in a fairly large range of maximal estriol levels of 80 to 340 pg/mL. After a single oral dose of 8 mg estriol in postmenopausal women, maximal levels of 65 pg/mL estriol and 60 ng/mL estriol conjugates were produced within an hour. With continued daily administration, this increased to peak levels of 130 pg/mL estriol, whereas maximal levels of estriol conjugates remained at 60 ng/mL. Levels of estriol rapidly decreased to low levels following occurrence of peak levels. Consumption of a meal 4 hours after taking an oral dose of 8 mg estriol during continuous daily administration resulted in a second estriol peak 2 hours later of 120 pg/mL, with estriol levels declining slowly thereafter to about 25 pg/mL after 24 hours.
The bioavailability of estriol is markedly increased with vaginal administration compared to oral administration. The relative bioavailability of oral estriol was found to be about 10% of that of vaginal estriol. In accordance, a single dose of 8 mg oral estriol and of 0.5 mg vaginal estriol have been found to produce similar circulating concentrations of estriol. It has been said that 0.5 to 1 mg vaginal estriol may be equivalent in clinical effect to 8 to 12 mg oral estriol. The high bioavailability of vaginal estriol is due to rapid absorption and low metabolism in atrophic vaginal mucosa. Vaginal estriol at typical clinical dosages results both in high local concentrations of estriol in the vagina and in systemic action. Vaginal administration of low doses of 30 µg estriol and of higher doses of 0.5 and 1 mg estriol have been found to produce equivalent local effects in the vagina and improvement of vaginal symptoms, suggesting that a saturation of estrogenic effect of vaginal estriol has been reached in the vagina by a dose of only 30 µg estriol. In contrast to higher doses of vaginal estriol however, 30 µg/day estriol is not associated with systemic effects. Similarly, the use of 0.5 mg vaginal estriol twice a week instead of daily has been said to largely attenuate the systemic effects of estriol. Whereas oral estriol results in high levels of estriol conjugates which greatly exceed those of unconjugated estriol, vaginal estriol has been found to produce levels of unconjugated estriol and estriol conjugates that are similar.
The absorption of estrogens by the skin is described as low for estriol, moderate for estradiol, and high for estrone. This is related to the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecules; the more hydroxyl groups, the lower the skin permeability. This may account for the relative lack of use of transdermal or topical estriol.
Rectal administration of estriol has been assessed in one study. Administration of a rectal suppository containing 100 mg estriol resulted in estriol levels in pregnant women at term increasing by about 53%. Estriol levels at term are normally between 5,000 and 20,000 pg/mL, which suggests that estriol levels may have increased following the suppository by about 5,000 to 10,000 pg/mL (precise levels were not provided).
Estriol succinate is an ester prodrug of estriol which is used medically via oral and vaginal routes similarly. In estriol succinate, two of the hydroxyl groups of estriol, those at the C16α and C17β positions, are esterified with succinic acid. As such, when adjusted for differences in molecular weight, a dose of 2 mg estriol succinate is equivalent to 1.18 mg unconjugated estriol. Unlike other estrogen esters, such as estradiol valerate, estriol succinate is hydrolyzed almost not at all in the intestinal mucosa when taken orally, and in relation to this, is absorbed more slowly than is estriol. Consequently, oral estriol succinate is a longer-acting form of estriol than oral estriol. Instead of in the gastrointestinal tract, oral estriol succinate is cleaved into estriol mainly in the liver. After a single 8 mg oral dose of estriol succinate, maximum levels of circulating estriol of 40 pg/mL are attained within 12 hours, and this increases up to 80 pg/mL with continued daily administration.
Distribution.
Similarly to estradiol, but unlike estrone, estriol is accumulated in target tissues. The plasma protein binding of estriol is approximately 92%, with about 91% bound to albumin, 1% bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 8% free or unbound. Estriol has very low affinity for SHBG, with only about 0.3% of the affinity of testosterone for this protein (or about 0.6% of that of estradiol). Relative to estradiol, which is about 98% plasma protein-bound, a significantly greater fraction of estriol is unbound in the circulation and hence available for biological activity (2% relative to 8%, respectively). This appears to account for the greater than expected biological activity of estriol relative to estradiol when considering its affinities for the estrogen receptors.
Metabolism.
Estriol is metabolized extensively via conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Glucuronidation of estriol takes place mainly in the intestinal mucosa, while sulfation occurs in the liver. More minor amounts of estriol can be oxidized and hydroxylated at various positions. One such reaction is transformation into 16α-hydroxyestrone. Estriol is an end-product of phase I estrogen metabolism and cannot be converted into estradiol or estrone. The main metabolites of estriol are estrogen conjugates, including estriol sulfates, estriol glucuronides, and mixed estriol sulfate/glucuronide conjugates. 16α-Hydroxyestrone is known to occur as a metabolite of estriol as well.
The biological half-life of oral estriol has been reported to be in the range of 5 to 10 hours. The elimination half-life of estriol following an intramuscular injection of 1 mg estriol has been found to be 1.5 to 5.3 hours. The blood half-life of unconjugated estriol has been reported to be 20 minutes. The metabolic clearance rate of estriol is approximately 1,110 L/day/m2, which is about twice that of estradiol. Hence, estriol is eliminated from the body more rapidly than is estradiol. Enterohepatic recycling may extend the duration of oral estriol.
A single 1 to 2 mg dose of estriol in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a duration of about 3 or 4 days. Estriol esters such as estriol dipropionate and estriol dihexanoate, when administered via intramuscular injection in an oil solution, have been found to maintain elevated levels of estriol for much longer amounts of time than oral or vaginal estriol, in the range of days to months. These two estriol esters have not been marketed, but estriol acetate benzoate and estriol tripropionate are medically used estriol esters which are given via depot intramuscular injection and are long-acting similarly. Polyestriol phosphate is an ester of estriol in the form of a polymer, and has a very long duration of action.
Excretion.
Estriol is excreted more than 95% in urine. This is due to the fact that estriol conjugates in the colon are completely hydrolyzed via bacterial enzymes and in turn estriol in this part of the body is reabsorbed into the body. The main urinary metabolites of exogenous estriol administered via intravenous injection in baboons have been found to be estriol 16α-glucuronide (65.8%), estriol 3-glucuronide (14.2%), estriol 3-sulfate (13.4%), and estriol 3-sulfate 16α-glucuronide (5.1%). The metabolism and excretion of estriol in these animals closely resembled that which has been observed in humans.
Chemistry.
Estriol, also known as 16α-hydroxyestradiol or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,16α,17β-triol, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds between the C1 and C2, C3 and C4, and C5 and C10 positions and hydroxyl groups at the C3, C16α, and C17β positions. The name "estriol" and the abbreviation "E3" were derived from the chemical terms estrin" (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and triol" (three hydroxyl groups).
Analogues.
A variety of analogues of estriol are known, including both naturally occurring isomers and synthetic substituted derivatives and esters. 16β-Epiestriol (epiestriol), 17α-epiestriol, and 16β,17α-epiestriol are isomers of estriol that are endogenous weak estrogens. Mytatrienediol (16α-methyl-16β-epiestriol 3-methyl ether) is a synthetic derivative of 16β-epiestriol that was never marketed. Estriol acetate benzoate, estriol succinate, and estriol tripropionate are synthetic estriol esters that have been marketed for medical use, whereas estriol dihexanoate, estriol dipropionate, and estriol triacetate have not been introduced. Quinestradol is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of estriol and has also been marketed. Polyestriol phosphate, an ester of estriol in the form of a polymer, has been marketed previously as well. These esters, ethers, and polymers are prodrugs of estriol. Ethinylestriol and nilestriol are synthetic C17α ethynylated derivatives of estriol. Ethinylestriol has not been marketed, but nilestriol, which is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinylestriol and a prodrug of it, has been.
Estetrol (E4), also known as 15α-hydroxyestriol, is a naturally occurring analogue of estriol with an additional hydroxyl group, at the C15α position. It is closely related to estriol and has similar but non-identical pharmacological properties. Like estriol, estetrol is a relatively weak and atypical estrogen. Estetrol is under development for potential clinical use for a variety of indications, such as menopausal hormone therapy and hormonal birth control.&lt;ref name="AdisInsight-E4/DRSP"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
History.
Estriol was discovered in 1930. Subsequently, it was introduced for medical use in oral and transdermal formulations under brand names such as "Estriol", "Oestrosalve", "Theelol", and "Tridestrin". In addition, conjugated estriol, containing mainly estriol glucuronide, was marketed in the 1930s, under the brand names "Emmenin" and "Progynon". They were the first orally active estrogen preparations to be introduced in medicine. In contrast to estrone, free estriol was never introduced for use by intramuscular injection. Estriol continues to be used medically today, widely throughout the world and in a variety of different formulations and brand names.
Society and culture.
Generic names.
"Estriol" is the generic name of estriol in American English and its , , , , and . It is pronounced . "Estriolo" is the name of estriol in Italian and "estriolum" is its name in Latin, whereas its name remains unchanged as "estriol" in Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. "Oestriol", in which the "O" is silent, was the former of estriol and its name in British English, but the spelling was eventually changed to "estriol".
Brand names.
Estriol is or has been marketed under a variety of brand names throughout the world, including Aacifemine, Colpogyn, Elinol, Estriel, Estriol, Estriosalbe, Estrokad, Evalon, Gydrelle, Gynäsan, Gynest, Gynoflor (in combination with lactobacilli), Incurin (veterinary), Klimax-E, OeKolp, Oestro-Gynaedron, Orgestriol, Ortho-Gynest, Ovesterin, Ovestin, Ovestinon, Ovestrion, Ovo-Vinces, Pausanol, Physiogine, Sinapause, Synapause, Synapause-E, Trophicrème, Vago-Med, Vacidox, and Xapro.
Estriol succinate has been marketed under the brand names Blissel, Evalon, Gelistrol, Hemostyptanon, Orgastyptin, Ovestin, Pausan, Sinapause, Styptanon, Synapsa, Synapasa, Synapausa, and Synapause. Estriol diacetate benzoate has been marketed under the brand name Holin-Depot and estriol tripropionate has been marketed under the brand name Estriel. Polyestriol phosphate has been marketed under the brand names Gynäsan, Klimadurin, and Triodurin. Emmenin and Progynon were estriol products marketed in the 1930s which were manufactured from the urine of pregnant women and contained estriol conjugates, primarily estriol glucuronide.
Estriol for multiple sclerosis had the tentative brand name Trimesta but did not complete development and was never marketed.
Availability.
Estriol is marketed widely throughout the world, including in Europe, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere. The medication is also available in some countries in the form of estriol succinate, an ester prodrug of estriol. Estriol and its esters are not approved for use in the United States or Canada, although estriol has been produced and sold by compounding pharmacies in North America for use as a component of bioidentical hormone therapy. In addition, topical creams containing estriol are not regulated in the United States and are available over-the-counter in this country.
Research.
Estriol may have immunomodulatory effects and has been of investigational interest in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and a number of other conditions. Estriol succinate was under development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in the United States and worldwide, and reached phase II clinical trials for this indication, but development was discontinued due to insufficient effectiveness. It had the tentative brand name Trimesta.
Veterinary use.
Estriol is used in veterinary medicine, under the brand name Incurin, in the treatment of urinary incontinence due to estrogen deficiency in dogs. Certain estrogens, like estradiol, can cause bone marrow suppression in dogs, which can be fatal, but estriol appears to pose less or possibly no risk.

Estrone (medication)

Estrone (E1), sold under the brand names Estragyn, Kestrin, and Theelin among many others, is an estrogen medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone which has been used in menopausal hormone therapy and for other indications. It has been provided as an aqueous suspension or oil solution given by injection into muscle and as a vaginal cream applied inside of the vagina. It can also be taken by mouth as estradiol/estrone/estriol (brand name Hormonin) and in the form of prodrugs like estropipate (estrone sulfate; brand name Ogen) and conjugated estrogens (mostly estrone sulfate; brand name Premarin).
Side effects of estrogens like estrone include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, headache, nausea, fluid retention, and edema, among others. Estrone is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. It is a relatively weak estrogen, with much lower activity than estradiol. However, estrone is converted in the body into estradiol, which provides most or all of its estrogenic potency. As such, estrone is a prodrug of estradiol.
Estrone was first discovered in 1929, and was introduced for medical use shortly thereafter. Although it has been used clinically in the past, estrone has largely been discontinued and is mostly no longer marketed.
Medical uses.
Estrone has been marketed in intramuscular and vaginal formulations and was used as an estrogen in the treatment of symptoms of low estrogen levels such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal or ovariectomized women. Estrone has also been used as an antigonadotropin and form of high-dose estrogen to treat prostate cancer in men as well as a form of high-dose estrogen to treat breast cancer in women. It has since largely been discontinued and is mostly no longer available, having been superseded by other estrogens with better potency and pharmacokinetics (namely oral bioavailability and duration).
Regardless of route of administration, if estrone is taken by a woman with an intact uterus, it should be combined with a progestogen such as progesterone to offset the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.
Estrone has been used by intramuscular injection at a dosage of 0.1 to 2 mg per week, or 0.1 to 0.5 mg given 2 or 3 times per week, for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy, and at a dosage of 0.1 to 1.0 mg weekly in single or divided doses for the treatment of female hypogonadism, surgical castration, and primary ovarian failure. The range of single doses of estrone by intramuscular injection that are typically used clinically in women is 0.1 to 5 mg. High doses of intramuscular estrone have been used for prostate cancer in men and for breast cancer in women.
Available forms.
Estrone for intramuscular injection was provided as 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 mg/mL aqueous suspensions and/or oil solutions. It has also been available in the form of vaginal creams (1 mg/g (0.1%)) and suppositories (0.2 mg, 0.25 mg) as well as subcutaneous pellet implants and oral tablets (1.25 mg). A combined oral tablet formulation containing estradiol (0.3 mg, 0.6 mg), estrone (0.7 mg, 1.4 mg), and estriol (0.135 mg, 0.27 mg) has been marketed under the brand name Hormonin as well. In addition, a combined injectable preparation containing estrone (1 mg) and progesterone (10 mg) is available in the form of ampoules under the brand name Synergon.
Although estrone by intramuscular injection was originally formulated as an oil solution, it was soon replaced by formulations of estrone as an aqueous suspension due to a longer duration of action of these formulations.
Side effects.
Side effects of estrogens like estrone include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, headache, nausea, fluid retention, and edema, among others. It can also cause endometrial hyperplasia.
Pharmacology.
Pharmacodynamics.
Mechanism of action.
Estrone is an estrogen, specifically an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs) ERα and ERβ. It is a far less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and as such is a relatively weak estrogen. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. According to one study, the relative binding affinities of estrone for the human ERα and ERβ were 4.0% and 3.5% of those estradiol, respectively, and the relative transactivational capacities of estrone at the ERα and ERβ were 2.6% and 4.3% of those of estradiol, respectively. In accordance, the estrogenic activity of estrone has been reported to be approximately 4% of that of estradiol. Other studies have reported that estrone has about one-tenth of the potency of estradiol in activating the ERs "in vitro". Because estrone can be transformed into estradiol, which is far more potent as an estrogen in comparison, most or all of the estrogenic potency of estrone "in vivo" is actually due to conversion into estradiol. As such, similarly to the case of estrone sulfate, estrone is considered to be a prodrug of estradiol. Some "in vitro" research has suggested that estrone might be able to partially antagonize the actions of estradiol, but this does not appear to be of clinical significance. In contrast to estradiol and estriol, estrone is not a ligand of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (affinity &gt;10,000 nM).
Effects in the body and brain.
In clinical research in the 1930s, estrone was given via intramuscular injection to ovariectomized women in order to study its effects and to elucidate the biological properties of estrogens in humans. In these studies, prior to administration of estrone, amenorrhea, atrophy of the breasts (as well as flaccidity and small and non-erectile nipples), vagina, and endometrium, vaginal dryness, and subjective symptoms of ovariectomy (e.g., hot flashes, mood changes) were all present in the women. Treatment with estrone was found to dose- and time-dependently produce a variety of effects, including breast changes, reproductive tract changes of the vagina, cervix, and endometrium/uterus, and relief from the subjective symptoms of ovariectomy, as well as increased libido. Breast changes specifically included enlargement and a sense of fullness, increased sensitivity and pigmentation of the nipples as well as nipple erection, tingling within the breast mammary glandular tissue, and aching and soreness of the breasts. Reproductive tract changes included increased growth, thickness, and differentiation of the endometrium, and reversal of vaginal and cervical atrophy, which were accompanied by increased congestion of the cervix and mucous discharge from the cervix, uterine cramps and needle-like pains, pelvic fullness, a "bearing-down" sensation, and increased vaginal lubrication, as well as uterine bleeding both during treatment and in the days following cessation of injections. Endometrial hyperplasia also occurred with sufficiently high doses of estrone.
Clinical research has confirmed the nature of estrone as an inactive prodrug of estradiol. With oral administration of estradiol, the ratio of estradiol levels to estrone levels is about 5 times higher on average than under normal physiological circumstances in premenopausal women and with parenteral (non-oral) routes of estradiol. Oral administration of menopausal replacement dosages of estradiol results in low, follicular phase levels of estradiol, whereas estrone levels resemble the high levels seen during the first trimester of pregnancy. In spite of markedly elevated levels of estrone with oral estradiol but not with transdermal estradiol, clinical studies have shown that doses of oral and transdermal estradiol achieving similar levels of estradiol possess equivalent and non-significantly different potency in terms of measures including suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, inhibition of bone resorption, and relief of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. In addition, estradiol levels were found to correlate with these effects, while estrone levels did not. These findings confirm that estrone has very low estrogenic activity, and also indicate that estrone does not diminish the estrogenic activity of estradiol. This contradicts some cell-free "in-vitro" research suggesting that high concentrations of estrone might be able to partially antagonize the actions of estradiol.
Pharmacokinetics.
Absorption.
Like estradiol, estrone has poor oral bioavailability. It has been said that, taken by mouth in non-micronized form, a dose of 25 mg estrone is approximately equivalent to 2.5 mg conjugated estrogens, 50 µg ethinylestradiol, or 1 mg diethylstilbestrol in terms of estrogenic potency. Due to its weak oral activity, estrone has been used parenterally instead, for instance by intramuscular injection or vaginal administration. The pharmacokinetics of vaginal estrone have been studied.
Estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a shorter duration than estrone in aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection. Estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection is rapidly absorbed, while estrone in aqueous suspension has a prolonged period of absorption. Upon intramuscular injection of estrone in aqueous solution, the water from the preparation is absorbed and a microcrystalline depot of estrone that is slowly absorbed by the body is formed. This is responsible for the prolonged duration of estrone in aqueous suspension compared to oil solution.
Distribution.
Unlike estradiol and estriol, estrone is not accumulated in target tissues. In terms of plasma protein binding, estrone is bound approximately 16% to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 80% to albumin, with the remainder (2.0 to 4.0%) circulating free or unbound. Estrone has about 24% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol for SHBG, and hence is relatively poorly bound to SHBG.
Metabolism.
Estrone is conjugated into estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate and estrone glucuronide by sulfotransferases and glucuronidases, and can also be hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 enzymes into catechol estrogens such as 2-hydroxyestrone and 4-hydroxyestrone or into estriol. Both of these transformations take place predominantly in the liver. Estrone can also be reversibly converted into estradiol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSDs), and this accounts for most or all of its estrogenic activity. 17β-HSD isoforms that are involved in the conversion of estrone into estradiol include 17β-HSD1, 17β-HSD3, 17β-HSD4, 17β-HSD7, 17β-HSD8, and 17β-HSD12, although the relative contributions of the different isoforms is unknown.
The biological half-lives of estrone and estradiol in the circulation are both about 10 to 70 minutes, whereas the biological half-life of estrone sulfate in the circulation is about 10 to 12 hours. The metabolic clearance rate of estrone is 1,050 L/day/m2 and of estradiol is 580 L/day/m2, while that of estrone sulfate is 80 L/day/m2. For comparison, the metabolic clearance rate of estriol is 1,110 L/day/m2. A single 1 to 2 mg dose of estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a duration of about 2 or 3 days. As an aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection, estrone was used at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg 2 to 3 times per week, or at a dose of 0.1 to 2 mg once a week or in divided doses. In one rodent study, exogenous estrone was administered and increased circulating estradiol levels by about 10-fold; co-administration of a selective 17β-HSD1 inhibitor decreased estradiol levels by about 50%.
The ratio of circulating estrone to circulating estradiol is the same at about 5:1 with both oral estradiol and oral estrone sulfate. An investigational estrone vaginal ring was found to result in a ratio of estrone to estradiol of 4:1 or 5:1 initially, but this decreased to about 1:1 with continuous therapy.
Excretion.
Estrone is excreted in urine in the form of estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate and estrone glucuronide. Following an intravenous injection of labeled estrone in women, almost 90% is excreted in urine and feces within 4 to 5 days. Enterohepatic recirculation causes a delay in excretion of estrone.
Chemistry.
Estrone, also known as estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds at the C1, C3, and C5 positions, a hydroxyl group at the C3 position, and a ketone group at the C17 position. The name "estrone" was derived from the chemical terms estrin" (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and "ketone.
A variety of estrone esters have been synthesized and described. These include the marketed esters estrone acetate, estrone sulfate, estrone tetraacetylglucoside, and estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), and the never-marketed esters estrone benzoate, estrone cyanate, estrone glucuronide, and estrone sulfamate.
History.
In 1927, Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim discovered that large amounts of estrogens were excreted in the urine of pregnant women. This rich source of estrogens allowed the development of potent estrogenic formulations for scientific and clinical use. In 1929, pure crystalline estrone was isolated from the urine of pregnant women by various researchers. By 1929, pharmaceutical preparations including "Amniotin" (Squibb), "Progynon" (Schering), and "Theelin" (Parke-Davis), purified from pregnancy urine, placentas, and/or amniotic fluid and containing purified estrone or mixtures of estrogens that included estrone, were being sold commercially for use by intramuscular injection. Other products and brand names of estrone marketed in the 1930s included "Estrone" (Abbott, Lilly), "Oestroform" (British Drug Houses), "Folliculin" (Organon), "Menformon" (Organon), and "Ketodestrin" (Paines &amp; Byrne), among others. These formulations included ampoules of oil or aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, oral tablets, and vaginal suppositories. Estrone in aqueous suspension for use by intramuscular injection was first described in 1941 and was introduced for medical use under the brand name "Theelin Aqueous Suspension" by 1944.

Availability.
Although estrone has been widely marketed in the past, it has mostly been discontinued and remains available in only a few countries. These countries reportedly include Canada, Georgia, Monaco, and Taiwan. However, estrone remains widely available throughout the world in the form of estrone sulfate, which can be found in estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), conjugated estrogens (Premarin), and esterified estrogens (Estratab, Menest).
Research.
An estrone vaginal ring was developed and studied for use in menopausal hormone therapy. It increased estrogen levels, suppressed gonadotropin levels, and relieved menopausal symptoms. Subcutaneous pellet implantation of estrone has also been studied.

Jean VI Rolin

Jean VI Rolin or Rollin (c.1450 – April 4, 1501), often referred to as Jean II Rolin to differentiate him from his father Jean Rolin or Rollin in the succession of the offices of Bishop of Autun, abbot of the Abbey of St. Martin, Autun, and prior of the Abbey of Saint-Marcel-lès-Chalon, was a French bishop.
Biography.
Jean VI Rolin was the illegitimate son of Jean V Rolin, Cardinal Rolin, and Raymonde de Roucy or Roussy, a nun of Avignon; he was legitimised by King Charles VIII in 1485. He spent his youth at the court of Burgundy, and won the tournament organized by John of Luxembourg for the feast day of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1472, in Valenciennes.
In 1477, after the death of Charles the Bold, he remained in the service of Charles' widow Margaret of York and became master of the petitions of the Duke of Austria.
He obtained a prebend in 1482 at the Collegiate Church of Our Lady, Beaune, and the position of dean of the Collegiate Church of Our Lady, Semur-en-Auxois. Antoine de Chalon, bishop of Autun, gave him his support in obtaining the position of dean of Autun Cathedral in 1484. The Estates of Burgundy named him ambassador to Charles VIII of France, of whom he quickly became the counsellor. He entered the Parlement of Paris and rose through the various levels.
He was bishop of Autun from June 8, 1500, to the date of his death on April 4, 1501, some considerable time after receiving the pallium, a position obtained with difficulty, because the previous bishop, Antoine de Chalon, had resigned to make way for Olivier de Vienne, a canon of Lyon, and Pope Alexander VI, had already granted the appropriate bulls. The canons of Autun protested and with the support of King Louis XII of France pressed their claim freely to elect their bishop, in this instance in the person of their dean, Jean Rolin. The Pope revoked the provision already made and transferred the bishopric to Rolin, but not until after the death of Olivier de Vienne. 
In his will Jean Rolin asked for a modest funeral and to be buried in Autun Cathedral, in the chapel of the Holy Cross, located in the eastern side, which he had put under the patronage of St. Martin. According to his wishes his body was accompanied during the funeral ceremony by thirty paupers, six foundlings and prayers of the Friars Minor, recently established in the city. He founded an anniversary mass in the Abbey of St. Martin, the Abbey of St. Symphorian and the Abbey of St. Andoche, all in Autun.

Guillaume Robin

Guillaume Robin, was a 15th-century architect and general contractor from Anjou.
Robin owes his fame to King René of Anjou who used his know-how for the realization of several monuments in Anjou.
As early as 1435, René d'Anjou asked his project manager, Robin, to double the size of his royal dwelling of the Château d'Angers with a gallery whose staircase bears his motto on the vault. He also had him build the "châtelet" around 1450.
In 1453, Robin redid the paving of the transept north of the Saint-Maurice Catheral of Angers. He also built in the cathedral the right handstaircase to provide access to the library in the south transept. He worked on the construction of the cathedral of Angers at the same time as the master glassmaker André Robin who placed the stained glass windows in the cathedral.
In 1454, at the end of the Hundred Years' War, René of Anjou inherited the ruins of his mother's castle in the town of Le Vieil-Baugé, still glowing with the French victory at the Battle of Baugé. He built a hunting lodge the size of a manor house, which became the Château de Baugé. The work was completed in 1465.

Electric railway of the White Knob Copper Co.

The electric railway of the White Knob Copper Co., Ltd. was operated by the White Knob Copper Co. at White Knob near Mackay, Idaho, in connection with its mines, having of railroad, two electric locomotives and 40 ore cars. The difference in level over the seven miles was , an average of 6 per cent. Eighty tons of ore were handled by each train.
Track.
The White Knob Copper Co., Ltd., of Mackay, Idaho, built a long single track railroad for the purpose of hauling ore in 1903. The railroad was put into operation in fall 1903 and was used entirely for freight trains, eight or ten cars being operated in one train.
The entire line was on a grade of about 6 per cent and the roadbed was laid with 60 lb/yard (30 kg/m) T-rails on rough cedar ties, between centers. Angle-bar joints were used and the railroad was rock ballasted.
Operation.
The railroad, was used exclusively as an industrial railway. There were two trains in regular service each of which carried about 80 tons of ore and each train made three to four trips daily.
The rolling stock included two Baldwin-Westinghouse electric locomotives long and wide over all. The locomotives had chilled castiron solid wheels with journals. They were equipped with Weslinghonse automatic air brakes. The rolling stock included 40 ore cars of 8 tons capacity, of the gondola type, each weighing , also two flat cars and two side dump ore cars, all of which were made by the American Steel &amp; Foundry Co. These were all equipped with Westinghouse automatic air brakes.
The regular scheduled speed of cars was , and the trains were operated by a dispatcher. A telephone system was installed along the line for use in dispatching.
The snow on the tracks of this road was deep in some places in the winter of 1903/04, but the company was able to operate it every day. The snow plow equipment consisted of two home-made pilot plows which were attached to locomotives.
Electrification.
The overhead line consisted of a No. 00 trolley wire and two aluminum feeders of seven-strand No. 4 wires, each of which was four miles long. The overhead material was furnished by the Ohio Brass Co. The railroad wound up through the hills and the feeders cut across ridges at times and in other places followed the track in order to give lapping points at a distance of every . The poles were long, of pine, and were in diameter at the top.
The power plant operated both the smelter and the railroad so that individual data are difficult to obtain. Water power has been acquired by the company and steps were being taken in 1904 to construct a new power house, lo supply both the smelter and the railroad from this water power instead of by the steam plant initially used.
The steam power house was and was a wooden building. It contained six 60-h.p. flue tubular boilers and three 155-h.p. McEwen engines directly connected to Westinghousc 500-Volt direct current generators. The boilers were fed with hot water 
from the blast furnaces. The switchboard was of marble, having six panels. It contained Weston ammeters and voltmeters and Westinghouse circuit breakers.
There was a car-house and a repair shop owned by the company, located at the smelter terminal of the road. The car-house was in dimensions and was used for storing the locomotives and for repairing cars. The building was of wood and had a 
 diameter fire line for fire protection. Two repair men were constantly employed at this shop, and it was equipped with a lathe, shaper, drill press, bolt machine, pipe machine, emery grinder and also a complete outfit for rewinding the motors of the locomotives and a blacksmith shop.
Management.
The railroad was under the management of the White Knob Copper Co., Ltd, initially with the following personnel:
Conversion.
After seven different managers had tried unsuccessfully to operate the property at a profit, the company was sold to George W. Young of New York on 18 March 1905, for $1 million. He replaced the expensive electric locomotives with a Shay geared steam locomotive. A aerial tramway replaced the Shay railroad in 1917/18 at a cost of $125,000.

Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny

Gabriel Count Cortois de Pressigny (Dijon, December 11, 1745 - Paris, May 2, 1823) was a French prelate, Bishop of Saint-Malo and then Archbishop of Besançon.
Biography.
Born in Dijon on December 11, 1745, Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny is the son of Claude-Antoine Cortois, coseigneur of Quincey, counselor to the Parliament of Burgundy, and Anne de Mussy. He is the youngest brother of Pierre-Marie-Magdeleine Cortois Balore successively bishop of the former diocese of Alais and Nimes and the nephew of Gabriel Cortois de Quincey, bishop of Belley.
Vicar General of Langres, abbot commendatory of Saint-Jacques in the diocese of Béziers, he is the prior of the priory of Commagny in Moulins-Engilbert, of which he holds the benefit at the time of the Revolution. He was appointed bishop of Saint-Malo on December 11, 1785, and crowned on January 15, 1786 by the bishops of Langres, Dijon and Chalons. He had chosen as vicar general Jacques Julien Mesle Grandclos, who was first archdeacon and, since 1782, abbot commendatory of the Abbey of Notre-Dame de la Chaume Machecoul.
On October 14, 1790, he was served the civil constitution of the French clergy and the abolition of his bishopric decreed by the National Assembly. Refusing to take an oath, he finds himself forced into exile, first in Chambéry, then in Switzerland and Bavaria.
Returning to France after the signing of the 1801 Concordat, he played no role under the First Empire. He offered his resignation to the pope only in 1816, a typical attitude of the survivors of the episcopate of the Ancien Régime, ultra-royalist and Gallican.
Charged in August 1814 by Louis XVIII to negotiate a new concordat with the Holy See, he was recalled in the spring of 1816, and was named peer of France and then archbishop of Besançon on September 20, 1817. But he did not officially take possession of his seat until November 1, 1819. Very often absent from the diocese, he died in Paris on May 2, 1823.

Tengku Permaisuri Norashikin

Tengku Permaisuri Norashikin (born Norashikin binti Abdul Rahman; 4 June 1971) is the queen consort of the 9th Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, making her the current Tengku Permaisuri of Selangor.
Background.
Norashikin was born in Kuala Lumpur on 4 June 1971 as the third child of her family. Her father, Abdul Rahman Baba, was an army veteran and a commoner. She received her secondary education at Convent Bukit Nanas Secondary School, Kuala Lumpur. Previously, she had worked as flight attendant for Malaysia Airlines before becoming a news anchor with Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) in 1996. She became an award winning news presenter as she won "Best TV News Presenter" award twice, during the 2001 and 2005 Seri Angkasa Award (ASA) respectively. She made her final appearance as a news presenter on 31 August 2016, on the evening after the private solemnization ceremony, anchoring the "Nasional 8" slot. She had already handed in her resignation letter shortly before her wedding.
From her previous marriage with an Etihad Airways pilot, Mustapha Kamal Halim, she has two children, a daughter and a son, named Nur Amanda and Adam Salleh respectively.
Marriage to Sultan of Selangor.
Norashikin married Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah on 31 August 2016 in a private ceremony at Masjid Istana Diraja, Istana Alam Shah, Klang. The couple had discussed beforehand that they wished for the ceremony to be private and intimate, with only close family and friends in attendance. For the sake of secrecy, she drove herself to the mosque without royal escort, while wearing her work clothing and only changed into her wedding outfit there.
They were solemnised by the Mufti of Selangor, Datuk Mohd Tamyes Abd Wahid. Selangor deputy mufti Dr Anhar Opir, Imam Mohd Rasid Mahful and former Selangor deputy mufti Datuk Abdul Majid Omar acted as witnesses of the ceremony. The simple ceremony was also witnessed by close family members of the bride and groom. In the evening, she went back to work and anchored the prime news segment, becoming the first queen consort to do so.
The marriage was announced to the public in the form of press statement and official photographs on 2 September 2016, just before the couple left for their honeymoon to Mauritius. The announcement came out as a shock towards Norashikin former coworkers as they had not known about her relationship with the Sultan prior to the wedding.

List of Parliamentary constituencies in the East of England (region)

The region of East of England is divided into 58 parliamentary constituencies which is made up of 16 Borough Constituencies and 42 County Constituencies. Since the general election of December 2019, 52 are represented by Conservative MPs, five by Labour MPs, and one by a Liberal Democrat MP.
Proposed boundary changes.
The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.
Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.
On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 was passed into law on 14 December 2020. This formally removed the duty to implement the 2018 review and set out the framework for future boundary reviews. The Act provided that the number of constituencies should remain at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.
The Act specified that the next review should be completed no later than 1 July 2023 and the Boundary Commission formally launched the 2023 Review on 5 January 2021. The Commission have calculated that the number of seats to be allocated to the Eastern region will increase by 3, from 58 to 61.
See 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies for further details.

The game has 32 cars, divided into 4 classes, A, B, C, D, which are in turn divided into multiple sub-groups. The game starts off where the player is lent a McLaren 570S to test out the controls and gameplay. With enough money to buy a Nissan 370Z or a Chevrolet Camaro 1LS.

Development.
The game started development in late 2014 when Eden Games became an independent games studio free of Atari.
In June 2017, publisher Microïds announced a line-up of games they were releasing for the Nintendo Switch, one of which was believed as a port of the mobile game "Gear.Club". In early August 2017, Microïds revealed via "Nintendo Life" that the title is in fact "Gear.Club Unlimited", which is an expansion to the free-to-play mobile game with additional cars and modes. Later that month, Microïds confirmed a 1 December 2017 release date, although they later clarified in October the December release date only applies to Europe, and announced the game will release in North America on 24 November 2017, with a limited physical release exclusive to GameStop.

In an interview with Red Bull, developer Eden Games clarified that "Gear.Club Unlimited", unlike its free-to-play mobile predecessor "Gear.Club", is a full premium title and has no microtransactions. They added that the game capitalises on the Nintendo Switch's power and attributes, stating the graphical fidelity will be 1080p at a steady 30 fps in docked mode, and that the game supports splitscreen local multiplayer with up to four players using a single Joy-Con controller. There are also plans for future downloadable content.
Reception.
The game received "mixed or average reviews" on Metacritic with a score of 64. It was consistently praised for its graphics, gameplay and lack of microtransactions, but criticised for its short and repetitive races and its weak AI.

The CDF is based at Wisma Pertahanan, Kuala Lumpur, nearby to the Ministry of Defence. The CDF is the highest rank in Malaysia Armed Forces only after the YDPA which hold the title Commander-in-Chief.
Also known as "Perintah Ulung" ( 'Superior Command'), the CDF is part of Armed Forces Council together with Minister of Defence, YPDA's representative, Chief of Army, Chief of Navy, Chief of Air Force, Chief of Staff and so on. CDF can be appointed from all three branch of Malaysia Armed Force—Malaysian Army, Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force.
The "Panglima Angkatan Tentera" (PAT; ) was formerly known as "Ketua Turus Angkatan Tentera" (KTAT; ) until in the early 1980s.
The current CDF is General Tan Sri Affendi Buang – having succeeded his predecessor, General Tan Sri Zulkifli Zainal Abidin on 2 January 2020.
History.
The United Kingdom governed Malaysia in its pre-independence days. Most of its military forces at that time is from Commonwealth nations. There is local military force such as the Penang and Province Wellesley Volunteer Corps, and other similar units created in Singapore and the other Malay States, however, it is more as a territorial army than as a federal army.
The Federal Council of the Federated Malay States passed the Malay Regiment Bill on 23 January 1933. With that, the first local federal military forces, the Malay Regiment (now known as the Royal Malay Regiment) formed.
After World War II, with the Malayan Emergency conflict emerges, the Malay Regiment increased to seven battalions. One multiracial regiment and one armoured vehicle squadron also formed. With this, the regiments merged into one single federal army, thus forming the Malayan Federation Army, the Malaysian Army predecessor. At that time, even with combinations with other branches (Navy and Air Force), the Malayan Armed Forces were relatively small. As the chief of the biggest branch of the armed forces, the Chief of Army was at the same time elected as the chief of the entire armed forces.
With Malaysia formation on 16 September 1963, North Borneo (now known as Sabah), Crown Colony of Sarawak (now known as Sarawak) and Singapore military forces merged with the Malayan Armed Forces into one single force. Because of this, the Chief of Armed Forces separated from the Chief of Army for ease of administration of the larger army.
List of Chief of Defence Forces.
Until 2020, 21 people had appointed as the Chief of Defence Forces, including two from Royal Malaysian Air Forces and one from Royal Malaysian Navy.

Reepicheep

Reepicheep the Mouse is a fictional character in the children's fantasy series "The Chronicles of Narnia" by C. S. Lewis. He appears as a minor character in "Prince Caspian" and as a major character in "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader", and also briefly at the end of "The Last Battle". Reepicheep is a Talking Mouse, the leader of the Talking Mice of Narnia; he is irascible yet imperturbably courteous, utterly without fear, and motivated by a deep concern for honour.
Description.
Reepicheep is a "gay and martial mouse", about two feet high when standing on his hind legs, with ears "nearly as long as (though broader than) a rabbit's"; small Talking Beasts in Narnia are very much larger than their "dumb" counterparts. He speaks with a shrill, piping voice. His fur is very dark, almost black. He wears a thin circlet of gold on his head, with a crimson feather. His weapon is a rapier.
Appearances.
In "Prince Caspian".
Reepicheep leads the Talking Mice in battle against the Telmarines under Caspian's command. He is badly wounded, losing his tail, in the climactic conflict. Lucy heals his wounds with her magic cordial, but he finds when he rises to address Aslan that his tail has not regrown, and he apologizes for appearing in such a dishonourable state. Aslan counters that he is perhaps too concerned about his honour. Reepicheep, in a key speech, replies to the effect that Talking Mice, being very small, would be at a constant disadvantage if they did not zealously guard their honour. The other Talking Mice prepare to cut their own tails off if their Chief is not allowed to retain his, at which Aslan relents and miraculously restores Reepicheep's tail.
In "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader".
The only Talking Beast amongst the eponymous ship's crew, Reepicheep reveals that he has been driven since infancy by a vision of finding Aslan's Country across the sea in the far east of the Narnian world. His aspirations and code of honour bring him into conflict early with the egregious Eustace, but when the latter is turned into a dragon by a curse, Reepicheep becomes his chief friend and comforter. It is Reepicheep who urges the "Dawn Treader" to sail into the mysterious Island of Darkness, thus facilitating the rescue of Lord Rhoop, the fourth of the Seven Lords of Narnia whom it is their mission to find. The final three are found in a cursed sleep on Ramandu's Island, which can only be broken, the party are told, if they sail to the End of the World and there leave at least one of their number never to return; Reepicheep volunteers for this role and, at the end of the book, carries through with it, thereby both breaking the curse and fulfilling his vision.
In "The Last Battle".
When the main characters reach the gates of the Garden in Aslan's Country at the end of "The Last Battle", it is Reepicheep who greets them.
Thematic significance.
Christian elements.
Whilst "The Chronicles of Narnia" are often described as an allegory for Christianity, Lewis (himself an expert on allegory in literature) disputed this description on technical grounds, since most of the characters and plot elements do not "stand for" figures or events in Christian doctrine in any simple way. When a class of American fifth-graders wrote asking what the characters in "Prince Caspian" represented, Lewis replied
In a letter to one reader, Lewis laid out the plan of the Narnia series: "The whole Narnian story is about Christ." Each book, he said, was intended to showcase a different aspect of Christianity, and for "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" it was "the spiritual life (specially in Reepicheep)".
Chivalry.
As a model both of ferocity on the battlefield and of courtesy in polite society, Reepicheep embodies the knightly ideal Lewis prescribes for manhood in his 1940 essay "The Necessity of Chivalry".

Von Bonde was born in Cape Town and matriculated at the Normal College Boys' High School, Cape Town, in 1912 before going on to the University of Cape Town where he attained his Master of Arts degree and was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in Zoology in 1918. He gained his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in zoology from the University of Cape Town in 1923, his thesis was "The zoogeographical distribution of the Heterosomata [flat fishes]". Between 1924 and 1925 he studied oceanography at the University of Liverpool, also serving as a lecturer in Zoology there. He returned to Cape Town in 1926 where he wa appointed as acting head of the Zoology Department following the death of Professor J.D.F. Gilchrist.
He was appointed as Director of Fisheries and Government Marine Biologist in South Africa in 1928 when he was also seconded to the Conference of East African Governors to conduct fisheries and marine biological surveys in Kenya and Zanzibar. The following year, he attended the International Conference on Oceanography and Continental Hydrography in Seville, Spain as a representative of the government of the Union of South Africa. In 1932 he travelled to the United States and Canada, following the award of a Carnegie Research Grant, where he visited the various marine biological and fisheries laboratories. In traveling to Europe in 1937 where he visited Germany, France and the United Kingdom as well as travelling to the United States and Canada again to broaden his experience of fisheries research and technology. He was a delegate of the Union Government to the second Conference of the F.A.O. in Copenhagen in 1946, becoming a member of the Fisheries Committee and being appointed to the Standing Advisory Committee of Fisheries of F.A.O. von Bonde was appointed as an International Whaling Commissioner in 1949 and later was appointed Chairman of the Whaling Technical Committee.
During von Bonde's tenure as Director of Fisheries, which ended in 1952, he had an important role in the development of the South African fishing industry, particularly the fishery of pelagic shoaling fishes, and in the research on Southern African marine resources. He was the author of numerous papers and articles on a number of marine biology and fisheries topics. He was also the author of textbooks, the last being 1956's "So Great Thy Sea". He was appointed as Managing Director of the Fisheries Development Corporation of South Africa in 1952 the position he remained in until his retirement in 1960. On retirement he went to live in Knysna, he remained an actively interested in all fisheries matters up until his death in 1983, following the developments and growth of the South African fishing industry and the resource research that he had helped to develop through its difficult early years. He married Marjorie Leibrandt in 1922.
He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Society of South Africa, as well as being a member of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science, for which organisation he served as president of Section D in 1931. His presidential address dealt with "The correlation between marine biology and the problems of the fishing industry". He was also a member of the South African Biological Society, the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, and a Fellow of the International Biographical Association (London). He received many awards including the Purcell Memorial Prize for Zoology of the University of Cape Town in 1926, the King George V Jubilee Silver Medal in 1936 and the King George VI Coronation Silver Medal in 1937.

Ocean Grazer

The Ocean Grazer is a conceptual energy collection platform, projected to house several renewable energy generation modules, including wave energy, solar energy and wind energy. The development of the Ocean Grazer platform has been carried out by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
The concept of the platform is currently on its version 3.0 centering on the modular design as opposed to the massiveness of the platform, as in the previous concepts. The majority of the harvested energy for all concepts is to be delivered by a wave energy converter that uses the motion of ocean surface waves to generate electrical energy
Wave energy converter operation.
The operating principle of the Ocean Grazer wave energy converter is to store potential energy by creating a hydraulic head, due to the differences in pressure between two reservoirs. All three concepts rely on this principle to function. The hydraulic head is created by circulating internal fluid from the lower to the upper reservoir via a novel hydro-mechanical power take off system, composed of distributed and coupled floaters. Each floater is linked to a separate multi-piston pumping system, consisting of differently sized pistons that regulate the amount of pumped fluid and that can be adapted to the surface wave conditions. Check valve systems are needed to minimize the back flow when the pistons return to their resting position. Lastly, similar to a hydroelectric plant, once enough fluid has been stored in the upper reservoir it can be circulated through a turbine system to generate electrical energy.

Lethe – Episode One

Lethe – Episode One is a 2016 first-person survival horror video game created by Greek indie developer Koukou Studios and published by Faber Interactive. It was released on 1 August 2016. "Episode One" is the first game of the "Lethe" series of planned video games that take place in the same universe but as of March 2018, no other episodes were published, which is why "Episode One" is also referred to as Lethe.
"Episode One" tells the story of Robert Dawn, a man on an adventure to fill in gaps in his memory. It received mixed reviews from critics.
Synopsis.
After his father died, protagonist Robert Dawn finds documents that reveal that he has forgotten a significant part of his past, prompting him to go on a quest for discovery. The game starts with Dawn washing up at the shore of an unknown mining town. In the course of the game, he has to navigate different environments and avoid enemies as he tries to piece together his forgotten past.
Gameplay.
Players take control of Robert Dawn from a first-person perspective. Unlike other adventure games, there are no weapons or combat. Instead, players have to rely on stealthily navigating the landscape, avoiding various hazards such as acid lakes and chasm. The player has three statistics, health, stamina and (psychic) energy, the latter of which allows them to use Dawn's telekinetic powers which the character develops mid-game. The game has no inventory system, allowing players to only carry five health and energy packs but nothing else.
Development.
"Episode One" was built using the Unreal Engine and first posted to Steam Greenlight on 31 August 2012. Two teaser trailers were released in March 2014, prompting comparisons to "" and . In November 2014, an alpha gameplay trailer was released. While the protagonist originally was supposed to wield multiple magic-like powers like shooting fireballs and lightning, the character's powers were reduced to telekinesis to emphasize the stealth approach.
Reception.
Reviewers praised the visual and audio design, highlighting that the immersive graphics and sounds will create a feeling for players as if they are actually in the game. Critics also emphasized that the game actually manages to scare players.
Conversely, the slow pace, forcing players to go slow even if they preferred faster travel, and the save system, forcing players to replay major parts of a level when the protagonist died, were criticized.

Production of Sense8

"Sense8" (a play on the word "sensate" ) is an American science fiction drama web television series created by Lana and Lilly Wachowski and J. Michael Straczynski for Netflix. The production companies behind "Sense8" include the Wachowskis' Anarchos Productions (replaced by Lana and her wife's Venus Castina Productions in the second season), Straczynski's Studio JMS, and Georgeville Television, with Unpronounceable Productions having been set up specifically for this show.
The show's first season introduced a multinational ensemble cast, with Aml Ameen, Doona Bae, Jamie Clayton, Tina Desai, Tuppence Middleton, Max Riemelt, Miguel Ángel Silvestre, and Brian J. Smith portraying eight strangers from different parts of the world who suddenly become "sensates"; human beings who are mentally and emotionally linked. Freema Agyeman, Terrence Mann, Anupam Kher, Naveen Andrews, and Daryl Hannah also star. In the second season Toby Onwumere replaces Ameen. The show aims to explore subjects that its creators feel have not been emphasized in many science fiction shows to date, such as politics, identity, sexuality, gender, and religion.
All episodes of the first season of "Sense8" were written by the Wachowskis and Straczynski; in the second season, Lilly Wachowski took a break from the show, and the episodes were written by just Lana Wachowski and Straczynski, with the exception of the series finale which was written by Lana, David Mitchell, and Aleksandar Hemon. Most of the episodes of the two seasons were directed by the Wachowskis (or just Lana, in the second season), with the remainder being divided between their frequent collaborators James McTeigue, Tom Tykwer, and Dan Glass. Lilly's break during the second season marked the first time in the sisters' career that they did not work together as a writing and directing unit. "Sense8" was filmed almost entirely on location in a multitude of cities around the world.
Conception.
According to the Wachowskis, the origins of "Sense8" date back several years before the announcement of the show to "a late-night conversation about the ways technology simultaneously unites and divides us". Straczynski recalls that when the Wachowskis decided to create their first series, because of Straczynski's extensive experience working with the format, Lana chose to invite him to her house in San Francisco to brainstorm ideas together. Both the Wachowskis and Straczynski agreed that if they were to do a television series, they wanted to attempt something that "nobody had done before", and change the "vocabulary for television production" the same way "The Matrix" became a major influence for action movies. After several days of discussion they decided on creating a show that would explore the relationship between empathy and evolution in the human race, and whose story would be told in a global scale, necessitating filming on location in several countries over the world, in contrast to the standard production model for television which attempts to limit or fake that as much as possible. A source of inspiration for Straczynski was his own experience concerning friends of his who live in different parts of the world but coordinate to watch a movie at the same time and comment to each other online about it.
The title of the show was thought up by Lana on their second day of brainstorming, during a time when they hadn't yet decided how many characters they were going to have. Lana appeared to Straczynski with a notebook with the word "Sense8" written in it, as a play on the word "sensate" and the notion of eight main characters, telling him "The hard part is over now!".
Development.
The trio became so excited with the concept they came up with, they decided to do initial development on their own instead of pitching it to someone else. The Wachowskis wrote three hour-long spec scripts, and together with Straczynski attempted to shop them around, such as at Warner Bros. and HBO, but when they saw that nobody could understand the concept they decided to shelve it. A few years later, when they felt that the landscape of television had become friendlier towards more experimental concepts, they decided to pitch it a second time. On October 2, 2012, "Variety" first reported the existence of the show, by writing that the Wachowskis, with the help of Straczynski's Studio JMS and Georgeville Television, would be shopping "Sense8" around Los Angeles the week to follow. If the series was picked up, the sisters and Straczynski would be sharing showrunner duties. Additionally, the Wachowskis were planning to direct a few episodes of the show if their schedule permitted it. According to Straczynski, the first meeting with potential buyers was with Netflix. The Wachowskis and Straczynski talked to them about subjects such as gender, identity, secrecy and privacy. According to Lana they pitched shooting on location all over the globe to which Netflix responded favorably, which was in contrast to the "clearly impossible" response they had received by other outlets during their earlier abortive attempt. They also told Netflix they were only interested if they had the freedom to "do anything", like "crazy psychic orgies with all sorts of different bodies" and "live births even" to which Netflix also responded positively. After the end of the meeting, despite it having seemingly gone well, they worried they had made a mistake because they had not pitched any action or otherwise commercial aspects. By noon, and before they had the chance to pitch it to other outlets, such as HBO, Netflix called them to preemptively offer to buy and produce the first season. Netflix announced that they had ordered a 10-episode first season for the series on March 27, 2013. Later, during filming, because of the density of the scripts and the extended length of the first cut of the first episode, the showrunners and Netflix came to an agreement to extend the season to 12 episodes. The Wachowskis and Straczynski's production company that was set up to run the show was named Unpronounceable Productions. The name was suggested by Straczynski, as a joke that references the difficulty of pronouncing the showrunners' long last names.
Before filming began, Straczynski and the Wachowskis mapped out five seasons worth of stories for the series, including the series' final episode, similarly to what Straczynski had previously done on his "Babylon 5" series. The actors cast were signed for five seasons. "We pitched it as a five-year story. We've mapped out five seasons of this thing, our actor deals are being made for five seasons, five or six depending on the breaks", said Straczynski. The first season acts as the origin story for the characters. When asked how long their story bible is, Straczynski replied "It's in our heads". However, Straczynski did compile a 30-page document detailing the key points of a hypothetical second season should the first season become a success.
Comic book artist Steve Skroce, who has been collaborating with the Wachowskis since "The Matrix" on both film and comic book media, has created storyboards for the show. Julie Wachowski, sister to the Wachowskis, is given the credit of "story researcher" in the closing credits of each episode of the first season. Karin Winslow Wachowski, Lana's wife, is credited for researching the story starting with the second episode of the second season.
Lilly Wachowski, after completing her gender transition, decided to take some time off and did not return as writer or director for the second season, although she remained active as co-creator. Straczynski, who had a very active role during season 1 from pre-production to post-production in order to assist the Wachowskis with their first foray into TV, said his primary involvement in season 2 finished with the completion of the writing phase, as Lana felt this time she had the required experience to tackle the filmmaking aspect of the show on her own. He also said that the second season was designed to explore the mythology of sensates, introduce other clusters, and provide answers to many of the questions viewers had after the first season. Lana came up with the idea of making the first episode of the second season a two-hour Christmas special, because of her love for such programming in the television shows that she watched as a kid, such as "Hill Street Blues", "Mork &amp; Mindy", and "All My Children". Lana explained she enjoyed watching the lives of the characters in specials intersect with her own and considered birthdays, holidays and celebrations unique events for their ability to make one feel connected but also isolated and alone.
Producer Roberto Malerba has disclosed that the first season had an average budget of about $15 million per episode, and the second season $9 million per episode.
Writing.
Initial writing for the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said a good portion of the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski believes writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.
Earlier versions of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, with the exception of the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. "The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.
Lana Wachowski, a trans woman, has written her first transgender character in her career in the series: Nomi Marks. For that she partly used her own experiences. "It has some very intense, autobiographical scenes, and that was very difficult and surreal," said Lana. Jamie Clayton, who plays Nomi, has provided the example of a scene where a young Nomi is bullied by boys in a gym shower, as a scene that was based on experiences from Lana's life. Freema Agyeman, who plays Nomi's girlfriend Amanita, has shared that her character was based heavily on Lana's wife, Karin Winslow. Straczynski has stated that (much like Lana's fondness towards the Nomi character) he felt close to Wolfgang Bogdanow, because both him and Wolfgang had a bad relationship with their respective fathers. "Wolfgang was my true north in the storytelling," said Straczynski. Straczynski did not reveal who was the character Lilly Wachowski felt the closest to during the writing process, saying it's up to her to do that. Since then, Lilly has come out as transgender too. The beginning of her transitioning process preceded the release of the first season, and Clayton had known about it early on.
Unlike the first season, where the Wachowskis and Straczynski split the number of scripts in half and worked remotely from each other (but with frequent meetings), writing for the second season was performed by Lana and Straczynski by collaborating inside a shared writers' room. The author of "Cloud Atlas" David Mitchell and the novelist and columnist Aleksandar Hemon worked as additional writers on the second season and were credited as "consultants"; they also made a cameo appearance in an episode as themselves. Both writers came to know and work with the Wachowskis prior to "Sense8". Lana became friends with Mitchell after adapting "Cloud Atlas" to film with her sister and Tom Tykwer, and was very surprised to read Mitchell's "The Bone Clocks" shortly before shooting the first season of "Sense8" to find it strongly resembled ""Sense8" and "Jupiter Ascending" [put] together", even though they each wrote their works separately. Hemon first met the Wachowskis in 2009, when they interviewed him looking for inspiration to write a movie script they wanted, and in turn he profiled them and wrote about the making of "Cloud Atlas" for "The New Yorker" in 2012. For the second season of "Sense8", Mitchell and Hemon were brought in to spend a week in September 2015 with Lana, Straczynski, and script supervisor Julie Brown, proposing to them situations, twists and turns, to be further developed by Lana and Straczynski. Afterwards and for the rest of the year, Mitchell and Hemon were regularly being tasked by Lana to write from distance select scenes on short deadlines, that she and Straczynski would further develop or reject. Hemon estimates he delivered around 120 pages, of which none made it to the second season's 700-paged script without changes. Later, once filming began, Lana did a lot of rewrites on a daily basis as she got inspired by the locations, actors, and so on, even on the set.
After completing writing for the second season, Straczynski moved on to other projects as a writer, while Mitchell and Hemon signed contracts to write for the third season over the summer of 2017. When the season was canceled by Netflix and later replaced by a special, Lana, Mitchell and Hemon returned as writers. Working 12–14 hours a day for six days per week, the three of them developed an outline within a week, and a 160-paged "writers' cut" of the completed script within three. Another week later they had it cut down to 130 pages and sent to the crew to begin pre-production, and some time later the actors received the final version, further revised and shortened, but with the ending omitted. The final 15 pages were delivered to each of them in a sealed envelope during the table read for the episode, with instructions to not open it before they are told to, so that they all get to read it for the first time together. The script during the table read bear the title "Amor Vincit Omnia", named after a famous Caravaggio painting, which translates to "Love Conquers All".
Casting.
On June 20, 2014, "Deadline Hollywood" announced the cast of the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers wanted to write a Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on "Cloud Atlas" and "Jupiter Ascending" before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on "Sense8" because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would have to be able to film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to "Sense8" because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing "Sense8" while working with them on "Jupiter Ascending" but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, "Deadline Hollywood" wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after "Speed Racer". Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' "Bound" and "The Matrix", was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.
On April 26, 2016, "Deadline Hollywood" reported that Aml Ameen abruptly left production a couple of episodes into filming of the second season over a conflict with Lana Wachowski that started during the table read for the season and progressively got worse. Both the "Deadline" article and Ameen's co-star on "Sense8", Tuppence Middleton, suggested the conflict was over creative differences. When asked about it, Straczynski commented he was not there to know what happened between Ameen and Lana but he respects the choices of both. Subsequent to Ameen's departure, the role of Capheus was recast to Toby Onwumere after a seven-day auditioning process. Onwumere watched a few episodes of the show to prepare for his audition, as he had not seen it before. The actor said about his approach to the character: "My duty [was] not to emulate exactly what [Ameen] has done, ... but just to give it my own spin, and kind of do my own thing, and just give this character the same essence, but ... maybe a different life and a different take on it." Lana described the unexpected change of the actors as "beautiful" and "perfect", commenting that it complimented her effort to explore the nature of identity in the series. She elaborated that in her opinion Ameen was an actor that was "quite good at being innocent and boyish" and Onwumere had similar qualities but was also someone that was "ready to ... become a political leader ... and also fall in love and be sort of sensual with another body", storylines that are explored in the second season of the show. Earlier in April, Kick Gurry, who had played parts in the Wachowskis' "Speed Racer" and "Jupiter Ascending" in the past, revealed he had been cast in the second season, after Lana called to inform him that they had a written a role specifically for him. In May, "Deadline Hollywood" reported Ben Cole had been cast as Todd, a sensate who would rather be "normal". In September, Sylvester McCoy reportedly revealed he filmed three or four episodes of the second season of a Netflix show, later identified to be "Sense8", and has signed to appear in further seasons if he is wanted. Martin Wuttke, who had minor roles in "Cloud Atlas", also joined the cast in the second season.
Carmen Cuba served as the casting director on the series.
Filming and locations.
To properly tell the international aspects of the story, filming for "Sense8" took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with the organizers of the Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to stare at the filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by "Slumdog Millionaire"s Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21, 2015. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.
For the second season, production credited 16 cities located in 11 countries for having been part of the filming. The major locations they filmed in, include all of the first season's except Reykjavík, and the following new ones: Amsterdam, Argyll, Chippenham, Los Angeles, Malta, Positano, Redwoods, and São Paulo. Production start for the main unit of the second season was given an expected date of March 2016, but a separate shoot involving the principal actors began on December 30, 2015, in Berlin, to capture footage during the Christmas holidays. This was followed by a short two-day shoot in Chicago, on January 23 and 24, 2016. Filming resumed in Berlin in the middle of March 2016, and proceeded to Mumbai on March 25, for a 10-day shoot. On April 7, filming started in Positano. Aml Ameen did not participated in the filming, as he had decided to depart from the production. Later in April, filming moved to Mexico, with Toby Onwumere replacing the departed Ameen, and specifically to Mexico City, and for one day in Metepec. Filming in California, San Francisco, began around May 5, and lasted up to May 20. Location manager Matthew Riutta was fined by the Department of Parks and Recreation when "someone accidentally got naked", during a romantic scene set at the tree swing in Billy Goat Hill. A short two-day shoot in Los Angeles, Malibu followed, starting May 24. Filming in São Paulo took place in late May, and specifically in its 20th Gay Pride Parade on May 29. Participating in the event was a late decision taken by Lana two days before the Parade began, as the production had previously abandoned their plans for the location due to scheduling conflicts. When Lana realized she could make it fit, they flew to São Paulo and filmed in the event in front of a crowd of millions, unrehearsed. Filming in Chicago began on June 5, and wrapped up on June 15, then moved to the United Kingdom, in London, Cambridge (Chippenham Park), and Scotland (Ardkinglas Estate and Castle Stalker, for 9 days), and wrapped on July 4. Then, filming moved to the Netherlands, in Amsterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, for about two weeks, up to July 19. In Amsterdam, they were the first production to film in the Rijksmuseum, with the real paintings of Rembrandt featured prominently in the scenes. Lana was told that insurance would never allow her to film there, but after writing an eight-page letter about what "The Night Watch" means to her and the importance of bringing art to the homes of those that are unable to go to Rijksmuseum, she eventually managed to get a permit. In Amsterdam's club Paradiso, they filmed Tuppence Middleton DJing with a real audience, and the rest of the cast dancing. After the Netherlands, filming proceeded to Nairobi as early as July 22, and later to South Korea, in Seoul and Bucheon, for the production's longest shoot, lasting about three weeks. Afterwards, filming moved to Berlin, until September 14, and during the same period, they also briefly returned to London to shoot outside the Houses of Parliament for two days. Filming then moved to Malta on September 18, for a two-day shoot, where they used the water tanks in Kalkara. On September 19, 2016, with the completion of the Malta shoot, filming for the second season came to an end. Overall, the cast and crew flew in excess of 250,000 miles to complete the season, while some directors and producers who also did location scouting flew as much as 370,000 miles.
Filming for the second special took place in Berlin, Brussels, Naples, and Paris. Production began in Berlin on October 2, 2017, and moved to Brussels on October 12, where they filmed in Villers Abbey in Villers-la-Ville. The next day filming began in Paris, where they remained up to October 24. Around midnight of October 22, they filmed a four-minute fireworks show near the Eiffel Tower. Due to insufficient notices posted by the Paris City Hall, reportedly some Parisians were taken by surprise and mistook the sound of the fireworks for a terrorist attack. On October 25 production moved to Naples where it remained up to November 4. They donated €7,000 to the local community to thank them for the hospitality, and to fund the construction of a pedestrian plaza. Filming resumed in Berlin later in November, and wrapped on November 12, 2017. A picture of the clapperboard used by the production shows that they consider the special as the twelfth episode of season 2.
Directing.
The show's directors were attached to locations instead of episodes and with several countries appearing in every episode, in reality none of them has a singular director. During the first season the Wachowskis were responsible for directorial duties in scenes shot in Chicago and San Francisco along with London and Iceland, two places which were initially announced to be helmed by Straczynski. Straczynski eventually opted to offer them to the siblings because of the extensive action scenes involved in those locations and instead focused his energy on post-production. James McTeigue ("V for Vendetta", "Ninja Assassin") worked on the Mexico City and Mumbai parts along with some in Reykjavík and German director Tom Tykwer ("Cloud Atlas"), whose "Nairobi Half Life" production impressed the Wachowskis, helmed Berlin and Nairobi. Dan Glass, who had been the visual effects supervisor for every Wachowski film since "The Matrix Reloaded", reprised his role in "Sense8" while also making his directorial debut in the Seoul part of the story. Even though there were times that units located in different countries were simultaneously shooting, the Wachowskis would travel to the various locations and have collaborations with the attached directors. Reportedly the Wachowskis directed such segments in locations where a different director was otherwise attached as the stunts the character of Silvestre performed for his action movie in Mexico City and in Nairobi car chase scenes with the "Van Damn" bus along with a fight scene involving machetes. In total, the Wachowskis were credited for directing seven episodes, McTeigue and Tykwer two each, and Glass one. During filming of the first season of "Sense8" the Wachowskis were shooting ten to fifteen pages a day, which was much faster than the two to three pages a day pace they were used to on the typical large budget film. They commented it put a lot of pressure on them, but Lilly also called it exciting learning how to adapt to it. Tykwer said he had to be moving at a pace of completing seven minutes per day, which he similarly found highly unusual coming from the world of film.
In the second season, Lana Wachowski took over many of the filmmaking aspects of the show, which combined with her sister's break, made her responsibilities as director shoot up. Production sound mixer Stevie Haywood recounted Lana's directing style was to use two cameras as the default setup, and develop the shot over "enormously long takes" which could last up to fifteen to twenty minutes. Additionally, the cast and crew under Lana did not use any rehearsals. "We rehearse on camera effectively", said Haywood. If there were any technical issues Lana expected the cast to improvise and keep the shoot going instead of calling "cut". Smith, Desai and Silvestre corroborated Lana's style of developing the shots on the set, her dislike for rehearsals, and the use of long takes, with the actors told to try different variations on how they play their parts. McTeigue returned as director for Mexico City. Tykwer returned as director for the Nairobi parts but not for the Berlin ones, as he was busy working on his own TV series, "Babylon Berlin". According to Glass, in the second season he directed the second unit in Seoul, and he also did some directing in Berlin. Overall, six episodes of the second season, including the Christmas special, credit Lana as director, three credit McTeigue, and Tykwer and Glass get credited each in one.
Lana returned as the main director of the series' second special, and Tykwer collaborated with her in Berlin.
Cinematography.
Netflix required the production to shoot with 4K cameras to make the look of the show future-proof and John Toll who is credited as the main director of photography for overseeing the distinct look of the nine featured locations, made the decision to shoot by using mostly Sony's CineAlta PMW-F55 cameras, paired with Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime and Cooke Optics S4 lenses. During the first season, Toll, once again collaborating with the Wachowskis and Glass after "Cloud Atlas" and "Jupiter Ascending", personally handled the cinematography in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Iceland, and Seoul. Toll's approach to shooting was to use a lot of Steadicam and hand-held partly out of the necessity to follow the faster schedule of a television production compared to the feature films he was used to working on. Additional cinematographers worked with the rest of the directors in the remaining locations and they used a similar shooting style because they were facing the same scheduling challenges. McTeigue's cinematographer of choice for shooting in Mexico City and Mumbai was Danny Ruhlmann, who previously shot "The Raven" and "Survivor" for him. Tykwer worked with Frank Griebe and Christian Almesberger for the Berlin and Nairobi scenes respectively. Griebe had previously shot seven feature films of Tykwer's including "Cloud Atlas" and Almesberger was the cinematographer of two films Tykwer had produced in Nairobi: "Soul Boy" and "Nairobi Half Life".
In the second season, production used again mostly F55 cameras, paired with Panavision Primo 11:1 zoom, Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime, and Fujinon 19-90mm Cabrio Premier lenses. Ruhlmann returned to work with McTeigue in Mexico City, Almesberger with Tykwer in Nairobi, and Toll with Lana Wachowski in all the remaining locations. They used a two camera setup (A and B), with the first being nearly all of the time Steadicam, and the second being hand-held all the time. Toll explained this setup was necessitated by both their tight schedule and large volume of the material, but also by Lana's commitment to stay with the A camera operator, Daniele Massaccesi, and make choices as they were filming. Toll further commented on their approach: "We adopted a system of shooting traditional wide master shots and, during the course of the shot, gracefully moving into other angles and even close-ups at times. Essentially, we were often doing masters and coverage within the same take." Toll's cinematography in the third episode of the second season, "Obligate Mutualisms", was recognized with a nomination for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series (One Hour) during the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.
Toll returned as cinematographer for the series' second special, teaming up again with Lana.
Effects and post-production.
Seoul unit director Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell were the visual effects supervisors of the first season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production made the decision to do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving in and out of the frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.
Technicolor provided dailies and worked with cinematographer John Toll and the Wachowskis to color grade the show giving it a look which colorist Tony Dustin describes as "both real and surreal, with a slightly elevated color-saturation". The Wachowskis made the mandate for production to not "lock reels", as it is typically done on TV shows, but instead be able to tinker editorially with the series' narrative, look and tone up to two weeks before release. They also wanted the color grading of the series to be done in the da Vinci Resolve software and be of theatrical feature film quality. Technicolor finished the show in 4K and delivered both 2K and 4K resolution masters.
In the second season, the visual effects supervisors were Dan Glass and Ryan Urban, the latter of whom held the title of digital effects supervisor during the first season. Technicolor were again responsible for managing dailies and color grading the show, while their VFX department delivered over 600 shots this time around.
"Sense8" was edited in the Wachowskis' headquarters in Chicago, Kinowerks, by Joe Hobeck and Joseph Jett Sally in the first season and by Sally and Fiona Colbeck in the second. Sally previously worked with the Wachowskis as first assistant editor on "Speed Racer" and editor on "Ninja Assassin". The Wachowskis found editing a TV show to be a challenging process because of the required fast turnaround times. Lilly commented that for a feature film they get a minimum of ten weeks for editing as mandated by the Directors Guild of America, while for the first season of "Sense8" they had to be moving at a pace of completing two 1-hour episodes (roughly the equivalent of a feature film) every two weeks.
Music.
The score of "Sense8" was composed by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer; the two had previously co-composed the score for "Cloud Atlas" and had a minor contribution in the soundtrack of "The Matrix Revolutions" as part of Pale 3. Responsible for the orchestration was their fellow "Cloud Atlas" collaborator Gene Pritsker, and the recording was done by the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra. Each season's score was written up to a year and a half before filming began, enabling the production to play it back to the actors before shooting a scene. Tykwer, who has made the music for all of his movies this way, introduced to the Wachowskis the concept of first writing the music during pre-production of "Cloud Atlas" and the sisters have since commented they are not making a movie again a different way. Once a first cut is completed by the editors, the composers do further developing of their tracks. "We flesh things out; both expand and refine, write new material and even change direction if it is prudent", the composers have explained.
The theme music of "Sense8" was picked by the Wachowskis from the two hours of original music Tykwer and Klimek had written. It was shortened from its original seven or eight minutes and a choir and electronic elements were added to it at the wish of the Wachowskis. The show received a nomination for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music during the 68th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.
Ethan Stoller, frequent collaborator of the Wachowskis is credited with composing additional music and also being the series' music editor. Long time Klimek and Tykwer collaborator Gabriel Isaac Mounsey is credited as additional score composer for the series and as one of the score mixers in the second season.
The title of the first season's fourth episode, "What's Going On?", refers to lyrics in the song "What's Up?" by the 4 Non Blondes, which was played in the episode during the main characters' first shared experience together. A soundtrack album for the first season was released digitally by WaterTower Music on May 5, 2017. It includes 10 tracks by Klimek and Tykwer, and the licensed songs "What's Up?", "Kettering" by The Antlers, "Keep It Close" by Seven Lions and featuring Kerli, and "Dauðalogn" by Sigur Rós. Klimek and Tykwer's compositions alone, are also available on WaterTower's YouTube channel. Klimek commented on his and Tykwer's collaboration with the Wachowskis for the first season's score: "We would often just do a one-week mad writing session. It's a very collaborative process, and there's no ego involved." Lana Wachowski called the score "its own unique script and it transports the viewer into the world of "Sense8" in ways neither words nor images can".
For the second season, Klimek and Tykwer provided to the editorial about 10 "mother" themes, each with a length of over five minutes, before filming began. This time around, Lana experimented more with combining original and source music while working with Mounsey, who in the last episode of the season was credited as composer, along with Klimek and Tykwer. In the Christmas special episode "Happy F*cking New Year", a cover of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" is featured, which was arranged by Gary Fry and recorded by the Apollo Chorus of Chicago, with the lead vocalist being Daniel Martin Moore. The sequence, which depicts the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus singing, was originally cut to a different cover of the song, but days before the deadline of completion the licensing deal fell through, and Stoller had to order a custom version to be conducted to match their completed cut. The song was ready in five days, and the producers were happy with the end result, including Netflix, which made the song a prominent feature of the special's marketing campaign. For the fifth episode of the season, "Fear Never Fixed Anything", Mounsey created a remix of "What's Up?" to be played by Riley in a club, recalling the first season's appearance of the song.
Title sequence.
For the series' almost two-minute long title sequence, Karin Winslow rented a car and with the help of a camera assistant traveled in the eight featured countries of the first season and captured over a hundred shots. "My directive from Lana was to go out and describe each country by what you see; find the nuances, find the food, find what people are doing, get a feel for the place," said Winslow. For the second season, and again for the finale, some of the footage was replaced by new shots, including a shot of the Wachowskis' parents. The closing credits of each episode credit Winslow for the "main title design".
Cancellation and revival.
On March 2, 2017, "Deadline Hollywood" reported that Netflix was in the process of renewing the lapsed contracts of the series' eight leading actors, to keep them available until June of the same year, suggesting that a positive decision to renew "Sense8" for a third season before that time passed was highly possible. In early May 2017, producer Malerba said that not all eight regulars of the cast had renewed yet, but the process was still going. Furthermore, he added that a potential third season would likely be the series' last, because of the complicated nature of the series' production, and the fact that starting with the second season Lana Wachowski worked as a filmmaker on it almost alone. On June 1, 2017, Netflix announced they had cancelled the series after two seasons. Shortly later within the month, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, commented that the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.
As a response to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of "Sense8" a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. The next day, actor Brian J. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership and thanking Netflix and the fans for their support.
Despite Netflix confirming multiple times within the month that there was nothing they could do for the show to return, fans continued to heavily campaign for it. On June 29, 2017, the official social media accounts of the show posted a letter by Lana Wachowski which announced the release of a two-hour special targeting 2018. In her letter, Lana confessed the show's cancellation had made her fall into depression, and thanked the fans, writing that it's only thanks to their strong collective voice that the show's revival was made possible. She also acknowledged the logistics of the show have always been challenging for Netflix. In August 2017, Sarandos said that at first Lana had rejected Netflix's offer of a two-hour special, as her preference was to continue with a new season. She eventually agreed to it, having been influenced by the fans asking for more. A final running time of 151 minutes was reported later.
Future.
Netflix billed the second special in their announcement as the series finale, but Lana left open the future of "Sense8" past the special's release, writing about it, "if this experience has taught me anything, you NEVER know." On August 5, 2017, during a Facebook Live with Lana and the cast about the show's revival, Lana joked that because she believed that the fans of the show would go and create more fans, she was writing the entire third season. Few days later, Smith said during an interview that he believed if "a truly eyebrow-raising amount of people" watched the special, they would make more. In October, actor Alfonso Herrera said both Lana and the cast want to make more so he's hopeful that the special won't be the end of the series.
In mid-August 2017, porn site xHamster wrote an open letter to the Wachowskis, offering to produce the third season, and a few days later received a call from Lana to whom they proposed to be the distribution platform. "Screen Rant" has criticized Xhamster's move as one of the many publicity stunts that porn companies set out to do to advertise themselves, while "Inverse" wrote the Wachowskis would never take their show to a platform that uses pejoratives to refer to transgender people.

Safinia gens

The gens Safinia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Safinius" belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from cognomina ending in "-inus". The root of the name is "Safineis", cognate with the Latin "Sabinus", the Oscan name for the Sabellic peoples, including the Sabines and Samnites.
Praenomina.
The chief praenomina of the Safinii were "Lucius", "Gaius", and "Marcus", the three most common names throughout all periods of Roman history. Other common praenomina were occasionally used, including "Publius", "Quintus", and "Titus". "Septimus" appears in a filiation. It was quite rare as a praenomen, but a fairly common surname, in which form might have been used in the filiation instead of a praenomen.
Branches and cognomina.
The Safinii of imperial times used a wide variety of personal cognomina, but a number of this gens bore the surname "Rufus", or its diminutive, "Rufinus", originally given to someone with red hair. At least some of these probably constituted a distinct family of the Safinii. Other surnames that might have represented "stirpes" of the Safinii include "Sabellio", belonging to a class of surnames derived from the names of peoples and places, undoubtedly alluding to the Sabellic origin of the gens, and the meaning of its nomen gentilicium; and perhaps "Primus", together with its diminutive, "Primilla", a name usually signifying the eldest son in a family, although this name might have belonged to otherwise unrelated Safinii, as at least some bearing this name appear to have been freedmen.

John Inglis (civil servant)

John Forbes David Inglis (5 August 1820 – 13 March 1894) was an East India Company civil servant, who became Chief Commissioner of Oudh in North India. His disagreement with Lord Lytton's Afghan policy led to him being passed over for an expected promotion to be Governor of North West Province. He took early retirement and on his return to Edinburgh, he founded, jointly with his daughter Elsie Inglis, the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women. That association established the Edinburgh Medical College for Women at a time that women were not accepted into British university medical schools.
Early life.
He was born on 5 August 1820, second youngest son of David Inglis and his wife Martha (née Money). David Inglis had spent most of his life in India as writer, or solicitor, for the East India Company. His father Alexander Inglis, who originated from Kingsmills, Inverness-shire, emigrated to Charleston, South Carolina leaving his son David to be brought up in Scotland by an uncle.
John Inglis was tutored by Rev Dr Joseph Niblock, a well known Greek scholar and educator. He then won a place at the East India College at Haileybury, moving to study there in 1839.
An incident at the school gives an interesting insight into the adolescence of a young man, described in later life as 'dedicated, pious, godly and 'honest'. On 29 May 1839 the Principal of the East India College at Haileybury, Charles Le Bas, wrote to Inglis' father:
'It is with unfeigned grief that I have to announce to you, that we have been under the afflicting necessity of rusticating your son for the remainder of the present term. You will doubtless recollect that, on a former occasion (Nov. 1838), I had the painful duty of inflicting on him ... a solemn Reprimand &amp; Admonition, for joining a late, and very turbulent party, by which much mischief was done, and several students greatly annoyed and molested. His recent offence is, that ... he dined at an Inn at Hoddesdon, and returned to College in a state of very questionable sobriety ... '.
From Haileybury College he went to Calcutta where he spent two years learning local languages before being posted as assistant magistrate to Agra.
Career in India.
In 1847 he was transferred to Sealcote (now Sialcot) in the Punjab. By 1856 he was married with a young family and returned with them to Britain for prolonged leave. He returned alone to India in 1858 and, working under Sir John Lawrence, Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, was involved in some of the conflicts in the Indian Rebellion, at Najibabad, Bareilly and Rohilkhand. He was made Commissioner of Rohilkhand and became a member of the Legislative Council of India in which capacity he moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1873. In 1875 he was made Chief Commissioner of Oudh State.
As Inglis progressed up the ranks of the Indian Civil Service he could count among his personal friends Sir William Muir, foreign secretary to the Indian Government and lieutenant-governor of the North Western Provinces. Muir would later prove an influential friend in his role as Principal of the University of Edinburgh. He remained close to his former mentor Sir John Lawrence and agreed with his ideal that India should become a land 'thickly cultivated by a fat contented yeomanry, each riding his own horse, sitting under his own fig tree and enjoying his rude family comforts.' Lawrence had become Viceroy of India in 1863. With such friends in high places and an unblemished record in India it was anticipated that Inglis would be promoted to be Governor of North Western Provinces. Yet with the change in Viceroy came a change in policy. The appointment of Lord Lytton in 1875 resulted in a harsher Imperial policy. Lytton ordered the invasion of Afghanistan which sparked the Second Anglo-Afghan War. This proved to be a brutal guerrilla war with much loss of life, and Inglis, regarded as a liberal by his superiors, found himself in disagreement with the policy and out of favour with the higher ranks of the Raj. He was passed over for this anticipated promotion and decided to retire, aged 56, and return with his family to Edinburgh, where his married daughter Amy had now settled. They sailed first to Tasmania to spend time with sons George, Hugh and Cecil who had settled there and in 1878 embarked on the journey to Edinburgh.
Personal life.
On 7 February 1846 he married Harriet Lowes Thompson, one of nine daughters of George Thompson, an East India Company administrator. She was eighteen at the time of their marriage. They had six children in their 'first family' George David (b 1847), Amy (b 1848), Cecil (b 1849), Hugh (b 1851), Herbert (b 1853) and Ernest (b 1856). In 1856 John Inglis arranged to take the family home to Britain for a period of leave of three years. This proved to be a prolonged journey which took 4 months to reach Bombay and a further 4 moths by sailing ship round Cape Hope to reach England. He was recalled early to India in 1858 because of the Indian Rebellion and returned leaving his family in Southampton. George, Hugh and Herbert were sent to school at Eton, Cecil to Uppingham and Ernest to Rugby, while Amy was looked after by relatives. Once they were settled and events in India were back to 'normal', Harriet Inglis returned to India in 1863 and they had the 'second family' of three further children, Eliza Maude (known as Elsie) (b 1864), Eva Helen (b 1866) and Horace (born 1868). Elsie Inglis, who would become the most famous of his children, was born in the Himalayan hill station town of Naini Tal, in the state of Uttarakhand, When the Inglis family moved to Tasmania the Inglis girls were tutored by Miss Knott, a disciple of Dorothea Beale, a pioneer of education for women.
Edinburgh and medical education for women.
In Edinburgh John Inglis arranged for Elsie to attend the new Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women which Sophia Jex-Blake had started in 1886. When Elsie Inglis emerged as the leader of a group of students who rebelled against what they perceived as Jex-Blake's over severe discipline, John Inglis with his daughter, formed the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women. Supporters included his former colleague Sir William Muir, now returned from India as Principal of the University of Edinburgh. The Association established the Edinburgh Medical College for Women, which opened in 1889. The influence of the Association was such that within two years they were able to endow two wards for the teaching of women medical students at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which had previously refused to allow the teaching of female students.
Elsie Inglis went on to become a surgeon, a prominent figure in the suffrage movement and founded the Scottish Women's Hospitals which saw service behind front lines in the First World War.
Inglis continued to write almost daily letters, full of encouragement and support, to his daughter Elsie, until his death in 1894.
Over 20 years later speaking at a large meeting at the Criterion Theatre in London in April 1916, she acknowledged the importance of his role in her life. 'If I have been able to do anything -whatever I am, whatever I have done - I owe it all to my father.' John Inglis is buried in Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh.

PCVC Speech Dataset

The PCVC (Persian Consonant Vowel Combination) Speech Dataset is a Modern Persian speech corpus for speech recognition and also speaker recognition. The dataset contains sound samples of Modern Persian combination of vowel and consonant phonemes from different speakers. Every sound sample contains just one consonant and one vowel So it is somehow labeled in phoneme level. This dataset consists of 23 Persian consonants and 6 vowels. The sound samples are all possible combinations of vowels and consonants (138 samples for each speaker). The sample rate of all speech samples is 48000 which means there are 48000 sound samples in every 1 second. Every sound sample starts with consonant then continues with vowel. In each sample, in average, 0.5 second of each sample is speech and the rest is silence. Each sound sample ends with silence. All of sound samples are denoised with "Adaptive noise reduction" algorithm.
Compared to Farsdat speech dataset and Persian speech corpus it is more easy to use because it is prepared in .mat data files. Also it is more based on phoneme based separation and all samples are denoised.
Contents.
The corpus is downloadable from its Kaggle web page, and contains the following:

Mariyam Azza

Mariyam Azza (born 20 April 1989) is a Maldivian film actress. She is the daughter of actress Aminath Rasheedha and younger sister to actress turned director Aishath Rishmy
Early life.
Born in Malé, Azza is the daughter of actress Aminath Rasheedha and the sister of actress Aishath Rishmy. She made a brief cameo appearance in the film "Mithuru", along with Rishmy, which was produced by her step-father Shiyam and co-starring with Rasheedha. In 1997, she starred alongside Rasheedha in Mohamed Ali Manik's "Maazee" (2000) which narrates the story of two best friends, a boy and a girl, who get separated at childhood and reunite as adults. Azza played the child role of Neeza, a high self-esteemed girl who disregard her own mother and childhood best friend.
Career.
2005–16: Debut and breakthrough.
In 2005, Azza appeared in a video single titled "Loabiviyya" alongside her sister, Rishmy, which became a chartbuster. She then appeared in several songs produced by her family production. Azza made her acting debut in a supporting role with "Hukuru Vileyrey" (2006), co-directed by Aishath Rishmy and Aminath Rasheedha which was based on a novel published by Ibrahim Waheed on "Haveeru Daily" in 2003. The film was a critical and commercial success while being considered as "one of the few acceptable horror film the Maldivian Film Industry has ever produced". It was later released as 15 episodes television series with inclusion of several clips that were edited off while released in theatre. Her performance fetched her a Gaumee Film Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
In 2015, Azza collaborated with Fathimath Nahula for two television drama series. In the first release, a 15-episodes romantic series "Vakivumuge Kurin", Azza portrayed a seductive colleague and an irresponsible wife who mistreats her mother. This was followed by "Umurah Salaan" (2015) which centers on a squabble family which is separated due to the greed for money and misunderstandings. The series which stars Mohamed Faisal, Aminath Rishfa, Ahmed Azmeel and Azza in lead roles, she portrays the character Shazly, an orphan who blindly trusts her husband.
In 2016, Azza played the role of Elisha, an innocent girl who becomes possessed while trapped in a house, in Fathimath Nahula's horror film "4426". Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of "Avas" labelled the film as a "masterpiece" and noted her performance to be "good" but not "consistent". However, it was also considered to be her "best performance" so far. Ahmed Adhushan reviewing for "Mihaaru" considered her dialogue delivery and expressions in the possessed scenes to "stand out" from the film while she delivered a "haunting performance" in her "breakthrough film". With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, "4426" was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year in the Maldives.
2017–present: Commercial success.
In 2017, Azza established herself as a leading actress of contemporary Maldivian cinema by featuring in four of the top-grossing productions of the year. Her first release of the year was the Ali Shifau-directed romantic comedy "Mee Loaybakee" alongside Mohamed Jumayyil. At the time of release, the film held the record of being the Maldivian film featuring the largest cast onscreen. The film tells the story of ex-lovers sliding into the friend zone, and the envy and diffidence they experience amidst a convoluted love-triangle. In the film, she played the role of Lam, an insecure friend of Ishan - her ex-boyfirend. The film and Azza's performance received mixed reviews, with Aishath Maaha of "Avas" calling her performance "a drawback from her previous films". The film emerged as one of the highest grossing Maldivian films of 2017. She next featured alongside an ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Mohamed Manik, Ahmed Saeed and Ali Seezan in another romantic comedy film "Naughty 40" which was directed by Shafeeu. The film revolves around three friends, Ashwanee, Ahsan and Ajwad (Played by Shafeeu, Saeed and Manik respectively) who are single and having a youthful outlook, in spite of being in their forties. She featured in dual roles - Ziyana, a woman who gets impregnated after being sexually assaulted, and later as Ashwa, the daughter of Ziyana, an introverted daughter who meets her father after nineteen years. The film met with both critical and commercial success, emerging as one of the highest grossing Maldivian films of 2017.
Abdul Faththaah's romantic drama "Hahdhu" was Azza's next film release. She was paid MVR50,000 for the role in the film, becoming the highest-paid actress in the Maldivian film industry alongside Niuma Mohamed for her work in "Niuma". The film touched upon controversial issues in the Maldives including the depiction of flogging and also shines a light on mental health by featuring an attempted suicide. Azza played the role of Yusra, an acquiescent and talkative young woman whose life changes with an extramarital affair. A reviewer from "Avas" wrote: "The transition from being loquacious to reticent, she played the character whole-heatedly saddening the audience with absolute emotions". The film opened to mixed reviews from critics though it emerged as one of the highest grossing Maldivian films of the year.
Her fourth and final release of the year was Aishath Rishmy's romantic drama "Bos". Penned and produced by Fathimath Nahula, the film tells the story of a woman from a royal family and her battle with depression after the demise of her father. Azza played the lead character Ibaa, who suffers from depression and is forced into an arranged marriage. A reviewer from "Avas" criticised the film for having a resemblance to American coming-of-age romantic drama "A Walk to Remember" (2002) and Indian romantic drama "Sanam Teri Kasam" (2016). The film along with her performance attracted mixed to positive critical reaction. The film emerged as the highest grossing Maldivian film of 2017 and Azza's fifth consecutive success at box office. During the year, Azza hosted the celebrity-based talk show "Azxonna", where she interviews actors, directors and other prominent members of the Maldivian film industry. The first season consisting of thirteen episodes were aired from 13 February 2017.
2018 was a dull year for Maldivian film-industry with regards to 2018 Maldivian presidential election. Her only release of the year was the first Maldivian web-series, a romantic drama by Fathimath Nahula, "Huvaa". The series consisting of sixty episodes and streamed through the digital platform Baiskoafu, centers around a happy and radiant family which breaks into despairing pieces after a tragic incident that led to an unaccountable loss. The series and her performance as a divorcee struggling to choose between her abusive ex-husband and a caring young man were positively received.
The following year, Azza starred in "Nafrathuvumun" (2019) alongside Shafeeu, Ali Azim and Ahmed Easa which revolves around a guesthouse, the only source of income for a woman who is convinced by several men to sell the property. Mariyam Waheedha from "Miadhu" praised Azza's "dynamic" performance and preferred her negative side of the character than her vulnerable personality. This was followed by another direction from Shafeeu, the romantic horror film "Dhauvath" (2019) which follows a happily married couple who goes on a honeymoon trip and the paranormal activities they experience due to black-magic. Mariyam Waheedha from "Miadhu" considers her portrayal of the character Zeeniya as "relevant in the horror scenes but unnatural in the calm scenes".
Media image.
Following the success of "4426", "Hahdhu" and "Bos", Azza's film roles were subject to wide commercial analysis. Analysing her career, "Avas" published that director Fathiman Nahula hits "ambergris jackpot" by casting Azza as the leading lady in "4426". She was described as the "replacement" of Niuma Mohamed whom the media cites as the most successful leading actress in Maldives. In 2011, Azza was voted sixth place as the "Most Entertaining Actress" in the SunFM Awards 2010, an award night ceremony initiated by Sun Media Group to honour the most recognized personalities in different fields, during the previous year. In 2017, she was the most successful contemporary actress in the Maldives. She is an active celebrity endorser for several brands and products. In 2018, she was ranked in the fifth position from "Dho?"'s list of Top Ten Actresses of Maldives where writer Aishath Maaha called her the most "bright and demanding" actress from the current generation.
Personal life.
Azza married one of her co-stars Abdulla Muaz on 20 February 2020.

Aimee Richardson

Aimee Richardson (born 29 December 1997) is an Irish actress. She is best known for her role as Myrcella Baratheon in the first two seasons of the television series "Game of Thrones" (2011–2012).
Life and career.
Early life.
Richardson was born on 29 December 1997 in Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland.
Acting career.
Richardson's first major acting role was her portrayal of Georgina in romantic comedy "Miss Conception" in 2008.
In 2011, Richardson was cast to play princess Myrcella Baratheon in "Game of Thrones". After the first two seasons, her character was exiled in-universe and therefore did not appear in the third or fourth seasons. At the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the character was returning for the fifth season, however the official cast list showed that the role had been recast to English actress Nell Tiger Free. HBO, the show's producers, offered no explanation for the decision. Richardson responded by uploading a video to Vine depicting her sitting on a pavement with a princess crown and a sign saying "PRINCESS FOR HIRE". The humorous reaction was received well by media sources, with The Daily Dot and The Radio Times describing it as "hilarious", and similar reactions from others. Business Insider, HuffPost and Insider Culture have noted that it is not uncommon for characters to be recast in "Game of Thrones". Free later said Richardson handled it "brilliantly" and in a "humble" manner.
Since appearing on "Game of Thrones", Richardson has been cast for roles on several other television shows such as "The Sparticle Mystery" (2015), "Storyland" (2016) and "My Mother and Other Strangers" (2016).

Argument mining

Argument mining, or argumentation mining, is a research area within the natural-language processing field. The goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs. Such argumentative structures include the premise, conclusions, the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument, or the main and counter-argument within discourse. The Argument Mining workshop series is the main research forum for argument mining related research.
Applications.
Argument mining has been applied in many different genres including the qualitative assessment of social media content (e.g. Twitter, Facebook), where it provides a powerful tool for policy-makers and researchers in social and political sciences. Other domains include legal documents, product reviews, scientific articles, online debates, newspaper articles and dialogical domains. Transfer learning approaches have been successfully used to combine the different domains into a domain agnostic argumentation model.
Argument mining has been used to provide students individual writing support by accessing and visualizing the argumentation discourse in their texts. The application of argument mining in a user-centered learning tool helped students to improve their argumentation skills significantly compared to traditional argumentation learning applications. 
Challenges.
Given the wide variety of text genres and the different research perspectives and approaches, it has been difficult to reach a common and objective evaluation scheme. Many annotated data sets have been proposed, with some gaining popularity, but a consensual data set is yet to be found. 
Annotating argumentative structures is a highly demanding task. There have been successful attempts to delegate such annotation tasks to the crowd but the process still requires a lot of effort and carries significant cost. Initial attempts to bypass this hurdle were made using the weak supervision approach.

Despite the negative reviews, he received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor and Best Director at 2nd Maldives Film Awards.
2013–2017: Further production ventures.
In 2013, Shafeeu featured in Ali Shifau-directed horror film "Fathis Handhuvaruge Feshun 3D" which serves as a prequel to "Fathis Handhuvaru" (1997) starring Reeko Moosa Manik and Niuma Mohamed in lead roles.

He played the role of Jinaa, a ghost that seeks revenge from humans for killing its wife. Upon release the film received generally negative reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem from "Haveeru Daily" wrote: "As we hear the name Jinaa, there comes the influence of Reeko Moosa Manik, where Shafeeu pales in comparison. The lack of excitement in his performance, a fear arises where the readers and viewers might dislike the classic character. Shafeeu failed to reach the anticipation Manik has brought to the character in its earlier release". Despite the negative reviews, at the 7th Gaumee Film Awards he was nominated in the Best Actor award category for his performance in the film.
The following year he starred opposite Fathimath Azifa in the suspense thriller film "24 Gadi Iru" (2014) which was co-directed by him and Mohamed Rasheed.

Nazim Hassan of "Avas" applauded the comic timing of the characters and picked the heated arguments between Shafeeu and Najeeb as the highlights of the film. He wrote: "Shafeeu proved he has comical sense though its a genre he has not explored before". The film emerged as one of the highest grossing Maldivian films of the year.
Shafeeu's first release of 2017 featured him alongside an ensemble cast including Mohamed Manik, Ahmed Saeed and Ali Seezan, Fathimath Azifa and Ali Azim in the romantic comedy film "Naughty 40" which was directed by himself. The film revolves around three friends, Ashwanee, Ahsan and Ajwad (Played by Shafeeu, Saeed and Manik respectively) who are single and having a youthful outlook, in spite of being in their forties.

The film marks Shafeeu's thirtieth direction and features an ensemble cast of twenty-one actors. Revolving around a murder investigating, Shafeeu played a character suffering from dissociative identity disorder and the accused murderer. The film received positive reviews from critics and was considered a "norm-breaker" of the Maldivian cinema. Ahmed Hameed Adam reviewing from VNews considered Shafeeu's performance as the "highlight of the film"; "Watch out for the little nuisance he brought into his character during the investigation scenes". Ismail Nail Rasheed from Raajje.mv wrote: "Shafeeu had to portray three different roles in the film and he lived in each character to its fullest". He then starred in the first Maldivian web-series, a romantic drama by Fathimath Nahula, "Huvaa". The series consisting of sixty episodes and streamed through the digital platform Baiskoafu, centers around a happy and radiant family which breaks into despairing pieces after a tragic incident that led to an unaccountable loss.

Shafeeu's first release of 2019 was the Moomin Fuad-directed psychological horror thriller "Nivairoalhi" (2019) which marks Niuma Mohamed's last onscreen film. 
Starring opposite Mohamed and Ahmed Asim, the film received majorly positive reviews from critics; Aishath Maaha of "Dho?" favored the performance of the lead actors and mentioned the "neat arrangement" of its screenplay though pointed out its "weak ending" to be unsatisfactory. Praising his performance as businessman and the husband of a patient suffering from depression, Maaha wrote: "The less said about Shafeeu's performance, the better. His performance is on a par with the standards he, himself has created". This was followed by his horror comedy film "40+" (2019), a sequel to 2017 released comedy film "Naughty 40" which was well received both critically and commercially. He next directed and starred in "Nafrathuvumun" (2019), played alongside Mariyam Azza, Ali Azim and Ahmed Easa revolves around a guesthouse, the only source of income for a woman who is convinced by several men to sell the property. Mariyam Waheedha from "Miadhu" praised his "simple yet convincing" performance as an obliging friend. Ifraz Ali from "Dho?" chose the film among the best five films released during the year and noted: "The director has chosen a different yet engaging concept, but fails to bring the best from actors". He then directed a romantic horror film "Dhauvath" (2019), which follows a happily married couple who goes on a honeymoon trip and the paranormal activities they experience due to black-magic. Mariyam Waheedha from "Miadhu" noted that Shafeeu "succeeds in exploring the witchcraft and black magic while perfectly conveying the moral message to audience and extracting the most from the actors". However, Ifraz Ali from "Dho?" chose the film among the worst five films released during the year while pointing out its resemblance with Turkey's "Sijjin film series".

High with Somebody

"High with Somebody" is a song by Swedish singer Sandro Cavazza and P3GI-13. The song was released on 23 March 2018 and peaked at number nine in Sweden.
Talking about writing the song Cavazza said, "I really felt like it was time to write something happy. I hope that this song will be the summer jam for a lot of people."
Background.
Cavazza told Entertainment Focus The story is based on a guy he was working with while living in Los Angeles. "He was an insane slacker, he had all the money in the world but he was so indifferent to it. He could throw a house party and while everyone else was having a blast he would just go to bed. He was someone who is really in a "Hakuna Matata" mentality. I live my life the polar opposite, working all the time for everything because I don't believe anything happens just for itself, but it was fun to write a song that is about someone who is absolutely certain that tomorrow everything will be sensational."
The song was co-written with as well as produced by Nicklas Lif, and mixed by Adel Dahdal.
Music video.
The music video for "High with Somebody" was directed by Robin Kempe-Bergman, produced by Robinovich and released on 23 March 2018. In a YouTube video released in April 2018, Cavazza said "We were going for a carefree video... me not caring, hence the stone face." Pip Ellwood-Hughes from Entertainment Focus said "The colourful video features Cavazza in bed with a variety of different people, including someone in a rabbit suit, and as it progresses he's seen sat on a couch while people interact around him."
Reception.
Scandipop described the song as "A super-catchy, summer-ready, radio-friendly, bop of a tune that sort of meets in the middle of what he delivered with both his debut EP and his Avicii collabs. It's got his own soulful sound, with the slightest of country influences."

Dugu Xin

Dugu Xin (獨孤信) (503 – 24 April 557), Xianbei name Qimitou (期彌頭), known as Dugu Ruyuan (獨孤如願) before 540, was a prominent military general and official during the chaotic Northern and Southern dynasties period of imperial China. In 534, Dugu Xin followed Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei to the west to join the warlord Yuwen Tai, and in the ensuing years led Western Wei forces against their archnemesis, the Eastern Wei. Despite an early debacle (after which he fled to and stayed for 3 years in the southern Liang dynasty before returning to the northwest), he captured the former Northern Wei capital Luoyang from Eastern Wei in 537. He rose to high ranks under Yuwen Tai, and his eldest daughter married Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Yu. When the Northern Zhou dynasty replaced Western Wei, Dugu Xin was created Duke of Wei (衛國公), but was soon forced by the powerful regent Yuwen Hu to commit suicide for challenging him.
Dugu Xin was described as an extremely handsome man and was fond of wearing strange clothes. He is best remembered today due to his 3 daughters: it is because of their marriages that he was a father-in-law to 2 emperors from 2 Chinese dynasties (Emperor Ming of Northern Zhou and Emperor Wen of Sui), and maternal grandfather to 2 emperors from 2 dynasties (Emperor Yang of Sui and Emperor Gaozu of Tang), all after his death. In fact, every Chinese emperor for 3 centuries (from 604 to 907, with the exception of Wu Zetian and self-proclaimed rebels) was partially descended from him. During the Sui dynasty, Dugu Xin was honored as Duke Jing of Zhao (趙景公) by Emperor Wen of Sui (who married his seventh daughter Dugu Qieluo); in 583, the empress built a temple dedicated to his memory in the capital Daxingcheng. (Remains of the temple were discovered in 1997 on the campus of Xi'an Jiaotong University.)

2018–19 snooker season

The 2018–19 snooker season was a series of professional snooker tournaments played between 10 May 2018 and 6 May 2019. The season was made up of ranking tournaments, non-ranking tournaments and variant tournaments. In total, 46 events were competed in the 2018–19 season, beginning with the pro–am 2018 Vienna Open, and ending with the 2019 World Snooker Championship.
To be eligible to play in most tournaments, players had to have qualified to play on the World Snooker Tour, however, some wildcard former professional, and amateur players were eligible in certain competitions. The season also saw four events strictly for over 40s, as a part of the World Seniors Tour.
Players.
The Main Tour consists of 128 professional players for the 2018/2019 season. The top 64 players from the prize money rankings after the 2018 World Championship and the 34 players earning a two-year card the previous year (excluding Lyu Haotian, who already climbed into the top 64 of the world rankings following the first year of his two-year tour card) automatically qualified for the season. Next, eight places were allocated from the top 8 on the One Year Ranking List, who had not already qualified for the Main Tour. Another two players came from the EBSA Qualifying Tour Play-Offs, two players came from the CBSA China Tour and a further 12 places were available through the Q School (four Event 1 winners, four Event 2 winners, and four Event 3 winners). The six remaining entries on to the tour were allocated from the international amateur events.
Due to the disputes between the IBSF and the WPBSA, the WPBSA decided that the winners of the tournaments organised by the IBSF or any continental confederations which were not affiliated to the World Snooker Federation would not be awarded tour cards. The only exception was the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship, which had been concluded before the decision was made.

Frances Gordon

Frances Graves aka Frances Gordon (born around 1874) was a British suffragette who became prominent in the militant wing of the Scottish women's suffrage movement prior to the First World War and was imprisoned and force-fed for her actions.
Campaigning for women's suffrage and arrest.
Frances (Florence) Graves adopted the alias Frances Gordon while campaigning for women's suffrage. Adopting an alias was not uncommon for campaigners, either to avoid their families being condemned by association or to evade capture by police.
Gordon and Arabella Scott were prominent in the militant wing of the Scottish women's suffrage movement. The pair were arrested after breaking into Springhall House, a mansion house in Lanarkshire, with the intention of setting it on fire on 3 April 1914. The house was not occupied but a caretaker was awoken by a noise at 2:30am and was astonished to find Gordon in the parlour.
The caretaker fired two shots with his revolver to alert the local constable on the beat.The noise of which caused the other suffragettes accompanying Gordon to flee the house. Frightened by the shots, the caretaker was able to lock Gordon in the kitchen and telephone the police. On arrival, the police found three-quarter gallon flasks of paraffin oil, matches and suffrage literature. Gordon was arrested and taken away.
Trial.
Gordon was described as a small woman of about forty years of age with a pronounced English accent. The lady owner of Springhall House declined to prosecute Gordon but the public prosecutor decided to proceed with the trial date fixed for 22 June 1914.
At the High Court of Glasgow, Gordon was charged with attempting to set fire to Springhall House. Gordon pleaded not guilty and her counsel attempted to have the case thrown out on a technicality - that housebreaking with intent to set a fire was not a crime in Scotland - but the attempt was unsuccessful and the guilty verdict was returned by the jury. She was sentenced to one year's imprisonment.
The "Glasgow Evening Times" covering the trial described "Miss Gordon's Remarkable Speech" as she left the court. Shouting to the gallery, she cried "Trust in God, constant war and fight on."
While the "Evening Times" made no mention of any disturbances, the High Court's own records mention three women being charged with contempt of court "in respect that they interrupted the proceedings of the Court by shouting and yelling (or by throwing missiles in the direction of the bench)". The three women refused to give their names to court officials.
Imprisonment.
While imprisoned in Perth prison, Arabella Scott, Gordon and fellow militant suffragette Fanny Parker were subjected to force-feeding. Dr Hugh Ferguson Watson had already subjected Ethel Moorhead to the treatment at Calton Prison in February 1914. The prisoners' mouths were held open by a metal device so that they could be fed by a funnel connected to a Vaseline-coated rubber tube pushed down their throats into their stomachs. The mixture contained eggs, sweetened milk, and meat juice.
Aware of Moorhead's earlier treatment, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) organised a series of protest meetings in Perth to support the women; picketing the prison, singing hymns and shouting support through a megaphone.
In Arabella Scott's autobiography, she describes the experience of being forcibly fed as bits of her broken teeth washed around with blood in her mouth. When she vomited after the tube was removed, "He [Watson] shouted at me 'you did that on purpose'." Parker and Gordon also alleged that this force-feeding involved attempts to feed through the rectum and the vagina which resulted in serious damage.
Gordon's force-feeding was to last ten days. She was fed with the nasal tube and had injections into her bowel three times a day. Christabel Pankhurst reacted strongly to condemn to this news, "To subject her to it without her consent was an act of violence and indecency on the part of the authorities which cannot and will not be tolerated."
On 26 June 1914, Dr. Watson, described as an "ambitious medical officer who had volunteered to force feed women on hunger strike", informed the governor of Perth prison that Gordon was of "a highly neurotic and hysterical temperament. There has been more or less nervous prostration since I told her that I had orders to feed her." Even during her sleep, Gordon "talked much about tubes and feeding". She had a very narrow phalanx and nasal passage and had "great difficulty breathing after the tube is passed."
Watson recorded that as Gordon vomited so much, he decided to feed her rectally through nutrient enemas in addition to food from the nasal tube from 30 June onwards. At first he was satisfied with the results but then he notes that on 3 July "the prisoner's condition now begins to cause anxiety". Gordon's temperature fell to 96.4 Fahrenheit and her pulse could sometimes barely be felt at all.
Reaction to news of the force-feeding.
The knowledge that new feeding tubes would not always have been available and that used tubes may have been dirty inside or previously used on diseased or mentally inmates may have increased Gordon's distress and the vociferous condemnations by her fellow suffragettes. When Gordon's 'treatment' was revealed, Dr. Watson was stunned by the furore it provoked in others. Lord Hugh Cecil, for one, told the Scottish Office that he intended to ask a question about Gordon's treatment in the House of Commons.
On 26 June 1914, Janie Allan, a leading Scottish activist in the militant suffragette movement, wrote to the Chairman of the Prison Commission that the burning down of Whitekirk Church in East Lothian, one of Scotland's most beautiful medieval churches, was the direct result of the force-feeding of Ethel Moorhead in Calton Prison and that the Scottish suffragettes would take strong action if the same was proved to have been inflicted on Arabella Scott and Frances Gordon.
Allan also wrote a similar letter to Dr. James Drevon stating that "there are many women who, 6 months ago, were not prepared to do anything violently militant, but who today would not hesitate." As a consequence, the planned tour of Scotland by the King and Queen in mid-July would see protests which "would be regrettable but to those who know how high feeling runs against forcible feeding, such incidents would cause no surprise."
The Scottish Office questioned whether any action could be taken against Janie Allan because of her veiled threats, but the Director of Public Prosecutions advised not.
Christabel Pankhurst went further in her condemnation:"This women-torturing government composed, not of men, but surely of devils! [Forcible feeding represented] all the barbarity, all the blind, brute force upon which the subjection of women depends... it "is" the opposition to Votes for Women." .
Release from prison.
On 3 July 1914, Gordon was released from prison under the Cat and Mouse Act and taken to Glasgow. It was there she was examined by Dr. Mabel Jones M.D.
The socialist Tom Anderson wrote to the "Glasgow Evening Times" about the case which quoted from the medical assessment Dr. Mabel Jones conducted on Gordon on her release:"I saw her (Miss. Gordon) at midnight on July 3. Her appearance was appalling, like a famine victim: the skin brown, her face bones standing out, her eyes half shut, her voice a whisper, her hands quite cold, her pulse a thread, her wrist joints slightly swollen, stiff, and painful, the breath most offensive, and the contents of the bowel beyond control." Reduced to the nearest point of death possible. Such treatment is barbarous and it is performed by civilised men because of a political offence, on women. Is it possible for the race to fall any lower? I don't think so. On 16 July 1914, Lord Hugh Cecil, John Pratt and Maurice Healy all raised the question of Frances Gordon's treatment in the House of Commons. The then Secretary for Scotland (Mr. Mckinnon Wood) replied that:"On admission she was at once put to bed and treated as a sick prisoner. Her condition required the administration of enemata, and I have no reason to doubt that in the circumstances the doctor treated her case properly and humanely. The doctor states that there was very little difference in her appearance when she was discharged...that she made no complaint of pain; that she was able to converse, and did converse freely with the doctor's assistant who accompanied her on the journey to Glasgow; that it is true that the breath was offensive, but that it had been offensive from the date of admission; and that generally the statement as to her condition is exaggerated."Lord Hugh Cecil challenged Mr. McKinnon Wood on whether in his answer he was guided wholly by the opinion of the medical officer whose action is called in question, or whether he has any independent opinion. To which Mr. McKinnon Wood responded:"I must be guided by the report of the medical officer who was responsible for this matter...the reason [that these women prisoners have in all recent cases been sent to Perth prison] is that we have there doctors who are accustomed to deal with those cases and are thoroughly skilled... I think the only thing I can add to what I have said already in the reply which dealt with most of the details of the woman's condition, is to say that she was able to walk to the cab and from the cab to the railway station, and in the railway train she was able to sit up and, as the doctor puts it, admire the scenery."Gordon had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU.
On 10 August 1914, not long after the outbreak of the First World War, the British government ordered that all prisoners convicted of suffrage agitation be released. Three days after this, Emmeline Pankhurst called an end to all militancy stating "it has been decided to economise the Union's energies and financial resources by a temporary suspension of activities."
In 2010, the story of the four suffragettes - Scott, Gordon, Parker and Maude Edwards - at Perth prison has been turned into a stage play, "Cat and Mouse", by playwright Ajay Close.

RFA Tideforce (A139)

RFA "Tideforce" is a replenishment tanker of the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA). Launched in 2017, the ship entered service with the RFA in 2019.
Construction.
"Tideforce", along with her three sister ships, was built by DSME in South Korea. As the fourth and final "Tide"-class vessel, her steel was first cut on 2 December 2015 prior to being laid down on 24 December 2015. Around nine months later, the ship was fully assembled and floated out by 12 September 2016. A series of builder's sea trials subsequently commenced and, in June 2018, the ship left South Korea for delivery to the United Kingdom via San Diego and the Panama Canal. The ship arrived in Falmouth for fitting out on 22 August 2018. This involved the installation of communications equipment, defensive systems, a floating helipad and refueling rigs. Following fitting out, the ship carried out capability assessment trials, replenishment at sea (RAS) trials and first-of-class flying trials. Her first RAS was carried out with off the Isle of Portland and a RAS with her sistership occurred shortly thereafter. In July 2019, she achieved further milestones, carrying out her first RAS with the aircraft carrier , as well as her first RAS with a foreign vessel, of the Royal Netherlands Navy.
Operational history.
"Tideforce" entered service with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary on 30 July 2019, the last of her class to do so following sister ships "Tidespring", "Tiderace" and "Tidesurge". In September, the ship joined the UK Carrier Strike Group on its three-month Westlant 19 deployment to the United States.
In August 2020, "Tideforce" rendezvoused with Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 to provide replenishment. In March, whilst conducting aviation training off the Devon and Dorset coast, "Tideforce" responded to an emergency call from a Dutch-flagged ship and provided assistance to an injured sailor. During the same month, the ship joined eight UK naval ships in responding to seven Russian vessels near British waters. In June, the ship carried out the first night time replenishment at sea with a Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier.

Everett–Snohomish Interurban

The Everett–Snohomish Interurban was a long interurban electric railroad between Everett and Snohomish, Washington. It was inaugurated by the Everett Railway &amp; Electric Co. of Everett, on December 1, 1903.
Lease.
The electric cars replaced steam trains on the track formerly used by the Northern Pacific Railway for its local trains, as a 
branch of its trans-continental system. The Electric Company has negotiated a lease of the track from the Northern Pacific for a term of several years, undertaking to make connections with all Northern Pacific trains at Snohomish, and handle all its passenger, regular baggage and express business between Everett and Snohomish. Transcontinental passengers, baggage and express over the Northern Pacific were handled by the Electric company between Everett and Snohomish, using Electric company "pasters" on all through tickets.
Stations.
The interurban served two terminals at Everett and Snohomish and six intermediate stops in various towns and neighborhoods. Each stop had an estimated population of about 200 people.
Electrification.
The overhead trolley system consisted of No. 0000 Fig. 8 trolley wire supported every by flexible brackets on side 
pole construction. The Ohio Brass Co's. material was used exclusively for trolley construction. The long poles were of cedar, at the top, and were set in the ground and placed from the rail. The trolley wire was from the top of the rail, on account of danger to brakemen on steam freight trains if lower construction was used. On account of the distance of the poles from the track, a bracket was used.
A 350,000 c.m. (177 mm²) feeder cable was used to within a mile (1.6 km) of the end of the line, taps being made every , while another 350,000 c.m. (177 mm²) cable was used to a point from the power house, at the point of heaviest grade.
Two draw bridges were crossed by this railroad, necessitating a pivot pole in the center of the draw span carrying the trolley, feeder, and return current cables up over this pole high enough to allow the passage of vessels up the river. Taps are made off of these cables at the pivot pole to the trolley and track on the bridge.
The entire construction of this railroad had to be done, while the Northern Pacific was operating an average of ten steam trains a day over it, making the work extremely difficult and hazardous. On account of the danger involved and the novel construction, the work was done under the personal supervision of the company's general superintendent, Mr. R. P. Stevens.
The track was bonded with Ohio Brass Co's. flexible No. 0000 bonds, with compressed terminals, which were expanded into holes in the rails. This bond was long and placed under the angle bars. No. 0000 cross bonds of the same type were used every .
Power for the operation of this railroad was furnished from the Everett power house of the Everett Railway &amp; Electric Co., about 
 from the further end of the line, and 1 mile (1.6 km) from the Everett terminal.
Rolling stock.
The rolling stock used on this line consisted of two passenger cars and one combination passenger and baggage car. The passenger cars were long and wide. They provided seats for 48 people. The slightly longer combination cars were overall long and wide. It seated 40 people and had a long baggage compartment.
The cars had cross seats, and windows with double sash, the upper sash being stationary and the lower sash dropping down. They were heated with the Consolidated Car Heater Co's eight-heater equipments and were mounted on Brill No. 27-E-1 trucks with 
 and spoke wheels, made by St. Louis Car Co. Westinghouse No. 68 motors, four to a car, hung inside. Westinghouse K-6 controllers, and Westinghouse air brakes were used on all three cars.
Operation.
The operation laid under telegraphic train orders from the chief dispatcher of the Northern Pacific at Seattle, the card system being used on this block on account of the frequency of the service, and the Northern Pacific still operating its freight trains on this line.
The fare from Everett to Snohomish one way was 25 cents. Round trip tickets were sold for 40 cents, including transfer from or to any part of the city. Tickets were sold at stations at each end of the line and on the cars, cash fare receipts being given by the conductors. Five cents were charged between any two stations.
Closure.
The interurban's trestle between Lowell and Snohomish was destroyed during a major flood in December 1921. The interurban was not rebuilt and soon abandoned. A section of the interurban's right of way in northern Snohomish is preserved as a gravel pedestrian trail.

Karl Tu'inukuafe

George Zvi Karl Tu'inukuafe (born 21 February 1993) is a New Zealand rugby union player who currently plays for the in Super Rugby, and for North Harbour in the Mitre 10 Cup. His position of choice is loosehead prop.
He has previously represented the Chiefs in Super Rugby, Narbonne in the French Rugby Pro Division 2 and has also earned 13 test caps for New Zealand since his international debut in 2018. Tu'inukuafe was also a nominee for World Rugby's Breakthrough Player of the Year award in 2018.
Early life.
Tu'inukuafe is an ex-pupil of Wesley College and played for their 1st XV Rugby team alongside current Blues teammate Nepo Laulala, as well as former All Blacks Malakai Fekitoa and Augustine Pulu. Tu'inukuafe worked as a Security Guard prior to signing to play for the North Harbour Rugby Union in 2015.
Playing career.
Early career.
Tu'inukuafe rose to prominence in the 2018 Super Rugby season when he was selected for the Chiefs as injury cover after season-ending injuries to rookies Aidan Ross and Atunaisa Moli. Tu'inukuafe became a regular starter for the Chiefs almost immediately and made 16 appearances for the club during 2018.
Tu'inukuafe was later selected for the All Blacks after Tim Perry was ruled out of the first two mid-year tests against France. Tu'inukuafe made his debut against France in their first June test match, which took place on 9 June 2018. Tu'inukuafe replaced Joe Moody off the bench, early in the second-half and was one of the best performing substitute players as the All Blacks won 52–11. Tu'inukuafe replaced Moody off the bench in the next two tests of the series, including the final, which the All Blacks won by 49–14, making the series a 3–0 win for New Zealand.
After starting for the Chiefs in their Super Rugby quarter-final against the Hurricanes on 20 July 2018, the Super Rugby season ended for Tu'inukuafe, with the Chiefs losing 31-32. Following the match, it was announced that Tu'inukuafe had committed to New Zealand Rugby until 2021. Tu'inukuafe is scheduled to move to the Blues for the 2019 Super Rugby season as part of his three-year deal.
Tu'inukuafe made his first start for the All Blacks during the 2018 Rugby Championship, starring in a 46-24 victory over Argentina's Los Pumas on 8 September. Tu'inukuafe was replaced by Tim Perry in the 59th minute and was one of the best-performing All Blacks against Los Pumas. Tu'inukuafe started again the following week, against South Africa's Springboks, after Joe Moody was ruled out with injury for the rest of the competition. New Zealand had a shock loss to South Africa, losing 34-36, despite Tu'inukuafe's 59-minute dominance over South African counterpart props, Frans Malherbe and Wilco Louw. Tu'inukuafe started in the last two tests against both Argentina and South Africa, both of which were wins for the All Blacks, winning them the competition and cementing his own place as a regular starter for his country.
Although Joe Moody returned from injury for the All Blacks' 2018 end-of-year tour, he was injured once again, with a cut eye, leaving Tu'inukuafe as the first-choice loosehead prop for the rest of the tour. Tu'inukuafe started against England, who had not played the All Blacks in four years, contributing 57 minutes of play towards the All Blacks' narrow 16-15 win over England. The following week, Tu'inukuafe then started against Ireland, who the All Blacks lost to, 9-16. Tu'inukuafe was unsurprisingly out-classed by his opposite, Irish prop Tadhg Furlong, with New Zealand's whole front-row only lasting for 46 minutes in the loss to Ireland. He finished his year off, replacing Ofa Tu'ungafasi against Italy, in a 66-3 win.
2019.
Although he established himself as a key member of the Blues' front row during the 2019 Super Rugby season, Tu'inukuafe failed to make the field for New Zealand in the 2019 Rugby Championship, with his former Chiefs teammate, Atu Moli, returning from long-term leg injuries. Having missed two months of rugby due to illness, Tu'inukuafe was dropped prior to the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
2020.
Tu'inukuafe scored his first international try in the 8th minute of the record-breaking 43-5 win over Australia in Sydney, the third match of the 2020 Bledisloe Cup.
World Rugby Awards.
In 2018 Tu'inukuafe was nominated for the World Rugby Breakthrough Player of the Year award. Tu'inukuafe joined Super Rugby franchise the Chiefs after a major injury crisis in his favoured loosehead prop position. After an impressive turnout for the franchise, he received a "sweet wake up call" when he was called up into the national team due to the injury of Tim Perry. Although Tu'inukuafe did not win the award, losing to South African winger, Aphiwe Dyantyi, he has won major respect from other rugby players and fans alike.
Honours.
All Blacks
Individual
Personal life.
Tu'inukuafe returned to playing rugby due to a significant weight gain when he was working as a Security Guard. Tu'inukuafe weighed in at 170 kg before returning to rugby and lost 35 kg, between then and making his international debut for New Zealand, becoming the second-to-heaviest All Black in history, second only to former All Black Neemia Tialata.
Tu'inukuafe has modelled for Johnny Bigg, a plus-sized menswear company, in 2018. Many of Tu'inukuafe's All Blacks team-mates, such as Rieko Ioane and Joe Moody have also done so.

Olivia Horn of Pitchfork described the single as "the song’s texture is laid down by a deep-set bass groove, twinkly disco synth, and sampled “woo!”s that puncture every break. Prass rides a wave of ecstatic vocal harmonies in and out of the chorus, where she sings plainly about a love that conquers all." On March 22, 2018, Prass performed the single on Conan.
The second single "Sisters" was released on March 28, 2018.
On May 1, 2018, the third single "Lost" was released. Prass explained the single is about "putting your foot down in a relationship when enough is enough. It's the journey of getting engulfed in another person's energy, good and bad, and ultimately understanding the other person is out to hurt you and not there to love you back."

Louise Thuliez

Louise Thuliez (12 December 1881–10 October 1966) was a French school teacher, resistance fighter during World War I and World War II and author.
Life and career.
Thuliez was born in Preux-au-Bois, northern France, on 12 December, 1881.
When World War I broke out, Thuliez was working as a teacher in Saint-Waast-la Vallée. She then became part of an underground network that helped allied soldiers who were trapped behind enemy lines to get out of Belgium and into Holland. She worked closely with Edith Cavell, Philippe Baucq and Princess Marie of Croÿ.
By the time German authorities closed in on the network, they had rescued around 200 soldiers. Thuliez was the first to be arrested, along with Philippe Baucq on 31 July 1915. She was sentenced to death by German court martial but the sentence was later reduced to life in prison due to the intervention of Alfonso XIII of Spain. She was imprisoned in Saint-Gilles prison in Brussels and released on 8 November, 1918.
Thuliez published a book in 1933 on her experiences in prison called, "Condemned to Death" which won a Montyon Prize in 1935.
Thuliez worked with Princess Marie de Croÿ again during World War II. Thuliez helped Allied soldiers escape from the Auvergne region of occupied France while de Croÿ hid soldiers in a château in Bellignies.
She died in Paris on 10 October, 1966. In 1970, a statue of Thuliez was erected in Preux-au-Bois and a street in Paris was named after her in 1974.

Paul Révoil

Amédée Marie Joseph Paul Révoil (3 May 1856 – 28 April 1914) was a French diplomat and administrator who represented France in Morocco (1896–1901), was Governor General of Algeria (1901–1903) and was French ambassador to Switzerland (1906) and Spain (1907–09). He is known for his role in moving towards a peaceful extension of French influence in Morocco.
Early years (1856–95).
Amédée Marie Joseph Paul Révoil was born on 3 May 1856 in Nîmes, Gard.
His parents were Henri Antoine Révoil (1822–1900), Chief Architect in the Monuments Historiques, and Louise Henriette Anaïs Baragnon (1829–1870).
He studied law and published his thesis for a license, "De l'Usufruit", in Paris on 30 May 1877.
He was a member of the Conférence Molé-Tocqueville, where on 13 March 1877 his proposal to limit the Legion of Honour decoration to military services was examined.
Paul Révoil was Chief of Staff of Jules Develle at the Ministry of Agriculture from 1890 to 1893 before following Deville to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, again as Chief of Staff.
On 30 October 1893 he was appointed Deputy Director of Commercial Affairs at the Consulates department.
He was promoted to "Directeur du cabinet" on 12 January 1895.
On 31 October 1895 Revoil was named Minister Plenipotentiary to Rio de Janeiro.
Morocco (1896–1901).
On 10 January 1896 Révoil became deputy to the Resident General in Tunis.
He was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tangier, Morocco.
The French were profoundly suspicious of British motives in Morocco, and thought they wanted to bring Morocco under their influence.
Révoil even told Abel Combarieu(), secretary-general of the Élysée Palace, that if persuasion, bribery and intimidation did not work, it was expected that the wives of English diplomats would sacrifice their honour for the sake of England.
In April 1900 Alfred Le Chatelier wrote and printed the brochure "Lettre à un Algérien sur la politique saharienne", which he sent to leading politicians.
The brochure showed the risks of rash action on the Moroccan border and called for a cautious but firm policy.
Eugène Étienne and Révoil both supported the brochure, and Le Chatelier was established as a force to be considered in setting North African policy.
In 1900 Théophile Delcassé, Minister of Foreign Affairs, named Revoil, one of Étienne's closest friends, as head of the Tangier legation.
This signalled the growing importance of Morocco to French policy.
Algeria (1901–03).
In June 1901 Révoil left Tangier to become Governor General of Algeria in place of Jonnart.
He was replaced in Tangier by Georges Saint-René Taillandier.
He accepted the job in Algeria after some resistance, pleading poor health and the need to settle important issues in Morocco.
He was persuaded by Delcassé, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, Minister of the Interior and President of the Council, and his friend Alexandre Millerand.
Delcassé thought that Révoil would prevent any military adventures.
In July 1901 Révoil wrote that after 70 years of French rule in Algeria it was finally becoming possible to exploit the Sahara commercially and strategically, linking France's West African territories to Mauritania and French Sudan.
At this time the status of the territories to the south of the traditional Algerian provinces was unclear. 
Stephen Pichon considered that a distinction should be made between Algeria and "territories annexed to Algeria".
This would allow the authorities to determine the date from which the inhabitants were French subjects.
Revoil was impatient with this question and wrote, "there can be no question of a distinction, in my view, between 'Algeria' and 'territories annexed to Algeria. 
He admitted that there had been no real annexation, but only "a police action in regions that we had always regarded as having belonged to French territory.
He could not delimit the physical boundaries of the southern territories, but thought any person from a place under nominal French authority must be considered French.
During the two years he spent in Algeria Révoil followed a policy of cooperation with Morocco with the goal of avoiding military incidents in the border.
In the summer of 1901 he went with the Moroccan envoy to Paris for talks about the frontier question, and acted as the main negotiator for France.
On 20 July 1901 Revoil and representatives of Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco signed the Protocol of Paris to define the border between Algeria and Morocco.
The protocol of 20 July 1901 was confirmed by a protocol of 20 April 1902.
Morocco recognized that Tuat was French territory, and agreed that in future when marauding tribesmen caused border incidents the agents of the two government should settle the issue on the spot through joint consultations.
Under the 1901 protocol two commissioners, Mohammed Guebbas of Morocco and General Auguste Constant Cauchemez of France, would go to the Guir-Zousfana region to implement the agreements.
They would inform the people of the oases of the way the protocol affected them, would appoint local commissioners to regulate tribal disputes, and would choose places for the Moroccan police and customs posts and the police posts in the "ksour" of Figuig.
This last was the most important to Revoil, since many of the tribesmen who had attacked French supply lines had taken refuge in the oasis of Figuig.
The railway from Djéniane Bourzeg had already extended to about from Figuig, and was to be extended towards Igli.
It was essential that French troops have control of all the areas around the Oued Zouzfana valley so they could protect the line.
Révoil created the position of "director of economic services" for Henri de Peyerimhoff, who settled with his wife in Algiers in April 1902.
Révoil later resigned due to political disputes and was replaced by Charles Jonnart.
He left office on 11 April 1903.
Peyerimhoff prepared a huge survey of the results of colonization that was published in 1906.
Last years (1903–14).
On 6 June 1903 Révoil was assigned to study the potential for developing indigenous societies of agricultural insurance in Tunisia along the lines of existing institutions in Algeria.
Révoil led the French delegation at the Algeciras Conference from 16 January 1906 to 7 April 1906, which aimed to resolve the First Moroccan Crisis.
Révoil collaborated closely with his British counterpart, Sir Arthur Nicholson.
He consulted with Nicholson before taking any important step, and was kept informed by Nicholson of the views of the other delegates.
Révoil gave credit to the "Archives marocaines" of the Mission scientifique du Maroc (MSM, Scientific Mission of Morocco) for providing the French delegates with the advantage of accurate information on subjects such as the legitimacy of expropriation under Sharia law.
Révoil said, "The MSM is thus one of the most justified institutions of our Moroccan policy. One can say that it has imposed itself even upon our most informed experts.
Révoil was detached on 15 June 1906 by order of Maurice Rouvier, Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Council.
On 26 September 1906 in Bern Revoil signed for France the International Convention Respecting the Prohibition of Night Work for Women in Industrial Employment.
He was appointed ambassador to Bern, Switzerland, on 28 November 1906.
He was appointed ambassador to Madrid, Spain, on 28 January 1907.
He held office until 1909.
He retired on 29 July 1910.
He spent the last years of his life as director of the Ottoman Bank in Paris.
It was through Révoil's influence that the Baux Valley Canal was built in 1914 near his home at Mouriès, Bouches du Rhône, to cope with periods of drought.
He helped provide a supply of drinking water to Mouriès.
Révoil died on 28 April 1914 in Mouriès.
The center of Mouriès is named the Cours Paul Revoil.
The village of Revoil Beni Ounif, by the Beni Ounif oasis in the department of Oran near Saoura, was founded in 1916 and named in his honour.

Vampironica

Vampironica is an ongoing American comic book series published by Archie Horror, an imprint of Archie Comics, beginning in 2018. The story, which takes place outside of the main Archie Comics continuity, focuses on Veronica Lodge as she navigates life after becoming a vampiress. It is written by Greg and Meg Smallwood, with the former also serving as an artist.
In 2019, the series crossed over with fellow Archie Horror staple, ', in the limited-run comic book series, '.
Publication history.
In March 2015, Archie Comics announced that a new title was in the works for the imprint featuring a significant female character from Archie's past. Written by Megan Smallwood, with art by co-writer Greg Smallwood and lettering by Jack Morelli, "Vampironica" was announced in December 2017. The series debuted on March 14, 2018.
The title originates from "Betty and Veronica" #261 (August 2012) by Dan Parent, which debuted the first version of the Vampirella-inspired Vampironica. The name is also mentioned in the first issue of fellow Archie Horror series "Afterlife with Archie". In the flagship series, Betty Cooper refers to Veronica Lodge as "Vampironica" in regards to the latter's Vampirella costume.
In October 2018, a crossover miniseries with fellow Archie Horror staple "" was announced. The limited series, titled "," was written by Frank Tieri and illustrated by Pat &amp; Tim Kennedy. Discussing the story and means of the crossover, Tieri said, "There are no vampires in "Jughead: The Hunger". "Vampironica", on the other hand, has no werewolves. Now, why is that? What happened in their respective worlds to cause an entire race to be wiped out? "Jughead: The Hunger vs. Vampironica" answers that question as well as what happens when these elements are reintroduced once again." The first issue was released on April 24, 2019.
Story arcs.
Riverdale’s resident rich girl Veronica Lodge is turned into a vampiress by another blood sucker hundreds of years her senior. Forced to contend with this new, radical transformation, Veronica must deal with the prospect of feeding on her own small-town cohorts.
Following her triumph against Ivan and his master, Veronica has to learn to her dismay that she, as well as her parents, were vampires all along. But as she confronts her parents, she and other vampires are whisked away into a parallel world and where vampires are extinct since the days of the French and Indian War. Veronica joins her friends in that world to combat the rogue vampires.
In September 2019 the publication of a new "Vampironica" mini-series, entitled "New Blood", was announced for December the same year. A direct follow-up on the events of "Jughead: The Hunger vs. Vampironica", the story follows Veronica's investigation of her newly-revealed ancestor Sir Francis Lodge, the tyrannical vampire who founded her American family line, while at the same time dealing with a new vampiric infestation in her native Riverdale.
Reception.
The series has received positive reviews. Justin Partridge of Newsarama said of the debut that it "fully commits to its own wild concept, while still keeping the Archie cast’s core characteristics intact." The series holds an average critic rating of 8.1/10 on the review aggregator Comic Book Roundup, based on 43 reviews.

Ponerorchis monantha is a species of plant in the family Orchidaceae native from south-east Tibet to south-central and north-central China.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described by Achille Eugène Finet in 1902, as "Peristylus monanthus". It was later transferred to "Orchis" and to "Amitostigma". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014, in which it was included as "Amitostigma monanthum", found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis monantha".

Depocenter

A depocenter or depocentre in geology is the part of a sedimentary basin where a particular rock unit has its maximum thickness. Depending on the controls on subsidence and the sedimentary environment the location of basin depocenters may vary with time, such as in active rift basins as extensional faults grow, link or become abandoned.

Prestatyn North

Prestatyn North is the name of one of the electoral wards of the town of Prestatyn, Denbighshire, Wales. It covers the northwest part of the town, either side of Victoria Road close to the beach. Prestatyn East ward lies to the east, while Rhyl East lies to the west.
According to the 2011 UK Census the population of the ward was 5,716 (with 4,624 of voting age).
County council elections.
The ward elects three county councillors to Denbighshire County Council and, at the May 2017 election, the seats were won by two Welsh Conservative candidates and one from Welsh Labour. In the past the ward has changed hands between Labour (who held the ward between 2012 and 2017), Conservatives and Independent councillors.
Prestatyn North became newsworthy in May 2012 when two candidates with similar names, Labour candidate Paul Penlington and Conservative Allan Pennington, were mixed up by the returning officer. A block of Penlington's votes were allocated to Pennington in error, with the latter being declared winner of the third council seat. Losing independent councillor, Mike German, demanded the election be re-run. After a costly legal dispute in the High Court, Penlington took his rightful seat, on 14 February 2013. All three seats were then held by the Welsh Labour Party.
Prestatyn Town Council.
For elections to Prestatyn Town Council the town is divided into six wards, with Prestatyn North county ward being subdivided into North and North West. Five of the eighteen town councillors are elected from the North and North West wards.

URI Purposely Built Vehicles

URI Purposely Built Vehicles, officially URI Purposely Built Vehicles PTY LTD, is a South African automotive company who manufactures the Uri off-road vehicle. The company makes two models - URI Desert Runner and URI Mining Vehicle. The first is a simple, reliable and passable jeep in civil, military and police modifications (the army and the police make the company almost the entire turnover).
History.
Originally the Uri was designed and built by Ewert Smith, a local Angora goat farmer based in Windhoek, Namibia designed the Uri all-terrain truck in 1995. Smith named the vehicle Uri, a Khoisan Nama word for "jump", and small scale production began in Witvlei, Namibia in 2001. Tested in the Kalahari desert, the African agro-, police, military and mining industries (De Beers/Anglo American Diamond Mines) ordered many of these trucks.
The original manufacturing company was called Uri - Automobiles, production was then taken over by Uri International Vehicle &amp; Equipment Marketing (Pty.) Ltd. (UVM) located in Waltloo, a north east suburb of Pretoria, South Africa. Since 2008, UVM was as a subsidiary of the South African defense contractor Ivema (Pty.) Ltd. As of 2015, the vehicle is produced by Uri Purposely Built Vehicle (PTY) LTD of Rustenburg, also in South Africa whose cofounders, Andre Squire and Raymond Squire, purchased over all intellectual property in 2015.
The vehicle was originally used in rally, but the designer found out that there could be a market in agriculture, police, military, and the mining industry.
Variants.
The Uri is broadly divided into two broad ranges Road and Mining in both 4×4 and 4×2 versions.
Uri Desert Runner.
Specifications
The vehicle is built of mechanical components from Toyota.
URI Mining Vehicle.
The URI Mining Vehicle is designed to operate in underground mines. The Uri Mining Vehicle is available in two different low-profile cab heights, a 1.4 meter high cab and URI 1.8 meter high cab.

Airco Caravan

Airco Caravan (born May 24, 1965) is a painter and conceptual artist based in Amsterdam and New York City.
Biography.
Early life.
Airco was born as Ine Reijnen in Boven-Leeuwen, Netherlands on May 24, 1965. She went to high-school at Pax Christi College in Druten, Netherlands and after this she studied art at the Utrecht School of the Arts, graduating in 1988.
Early career.
After art school, Airco went to work as an art director and freelance designer for several years. In 2006 she attended a screen printing course at MK24 in Amsterdam. Slowly she started going back to her first love: painting. In 2011, she went to the Art Students League of New York, where she perfected her oil painting skills. She still calls painting an eternal struggle.
Exhibitions and major projects.
Airco is a women's rights and human rights activist. In 2013, Airco asked 16 different Chinese artists to paint a different part of the face of the Dalai Lama. The artists made a painting of a nose, ear or a peace of skin, while they thought they were painting a mango, curtain or other object. It had to be done this way, because the image of the Dalai Lama is forbidden in China. They sent the pieces to the Netherlands where Airco assembled everything to a portrait. It was offered to the Dalai Lama by the International Campaign for Tibet on his birthday on July 6 2014.
In 2017, she took part in several Nasty Women exhibitions and co-organized the one in Amsterdam at Josilda da Conceição Gallery. The money raised was donated to Women on Waves, COC Amsterdam and She Decides.
On March 21, 2018, the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Airco offered a sulpture of Martin Luther King Jr. to Sylvana Simons at the Open Space Contemporary Art Museum in Amsterdam. With the art project "Monument for Martin Luther King", Airco asked two sculptors to create 50 sculptures of King with the intention to connect past and present. John Lewis, Barack and Michelle Obama were among the 49 other recipients of a sculpture.
Personal life.
Airco is married to BSNSSMN. They reside in Amsterdam and New York.

Panicum hillmanii

Panicum hillmanii, commonly known as Hillmann's panicgrass, is a grass from genus "Panicum" native to Southwestern United States. It has been introduced to many other areas, notably including southern Australia where it became widespread, and several parts of Europe.
Description.
"Panicum hillmannii" is a perennial grass that resembles the related "P. capillare" (hairy panic) in habitat and appearance. It is distinguished by slightly stiffer panicles, firmer foliage, the rachilla shortly developed between the upper and lower glumes, the sterile floret which has the palea developed; and larger darker fertile lemma (up to 2mm long) with a prominent crescent-shaped scar at its base.
Distribution and habitat.
"Panicum hillmannii" is native to Southwest United States. It was introduced to Australia in the early 1900s, and has spread across South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, sharing the habitat with related native witchgrass ("P. effusum"). It was also introduced to Europe, and specimens have been found in France, Belgium, Austria and Germany, although it remains relatively rare there and confined to agricultural weed in maize fields and habitats such as roadsides.
Like several other "Panicum" species ("P. capillare" and "P. effusum"), Hillman's panicgrass can become a tumbleweed under extremely dry conditions, and can become a nuisance in residential areas due to the accumulation of grass stalks. Dry tumbleweed poses a serious fire danger. The plant is potentially harmful for grazing livestock, as it contains saponins causing liver damage in animals.

Eugene Messler

Eugene Lawrence Messler (April 6, 1873 – March 1, 1950) was an American football player and coach and businessman. He played at the tackle position for Yale's 1891, 1892, and 1893 championship teams, coached the 1894 Centre football team, and was the player-coach on the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club professional football teams from 1895 to 1897. He was the general superintendent of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company's Pittsburgh coke ovens and blast furnaces from approximately 1899 to 1911 and the president of the Eureka Fire Brick Company for many years commencing in 1907.
Early years.
Born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh) in 1873, Messler was the son of Thomas D. Messler (1834–1893), an executive with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Maria Remsen (Varick) Messler. He was educated in the Allegheny schools and later at the Shady Side Academy.
Messler enrolled at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1891. He played college football on Yale's freshman and varsity football team in 1891. He played at the tackle position under Yale's head coach Walter Camp and was a member of Camp's undefeated 1892 Yale team. In his final year at Yale, he played for the 1893 Yale team. In the three years that Messler played football for Yale, the teams were recognized as national champion each year, compiled an overall record of 36–1, and outscored opponents by a total of 1,247 to 12. Messer also competed on the Yale crew, served as class president for two years, and graduated in 1894 with a degree in mechanical engineering.
Coaching career.
He served as the head football coach at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 1894. Messler arrived in Danville in mid-September and was greeted at the railroad depot with "ringing cheers" by a delegation of students. Messler promptly initiated daily training for the football candidates and was credited with implementing "a course of systematic work and active training." He led the 1894 Centre football team to a 3–1 record, including a 110–0 victory over Bethel College and a 67–0 victory over Kentucky State (now known as the University of Kentucky). The team's only loss was by a 6–0 score to a Vanderbilt team that compiled a 7–1 record.
Messler was also the coach and a player for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, an early professional football team, from 1895 to 1897. The team was the champion of Western Pennsylvania Independent Football in 1895.
Business career and later years.
Messler began a career in business with the Carnegie Steel Company at the Edger Thompson Works and later worked for Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Co. In May 1895, Messler served as engineer overseeing the construction of the Duquesne blast furnaces and later became the general superintendent of labor. He favored an induced draft that could vary the pressure in furnaces so they would not have to depend entirely on a stack, noting that excessive temperatures were an unnecessary test on the brick linings. He was the general superintendent of Jones &amp; Laughlin's coke ovens and blast furnaces from approximately 1899 to 1911. From 1912 to 1915 he was assistant to the president at the Riter-Conley Manufacturing Company, and from 1916 to 1918 was vice president of the Witherow Steel Company. He also served as president of the Eureka Fire Brick Company for many years commencing in 1907. 
Messler also served as the director of the Fisher Scientific Company and the Scientific Materials Company. At one time he was also the director of the Third National Bank of Pittsburgh. He was a member of several societies, including the National Geographic Society, the Engineer's Society of Western Pennsylvania, the Iron and Steel Institute, and the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. He was an avid big-game hunter and was an amateur tennis player.
Messler also served in the United States Army during World War I, after being commissioned captain of engineers on May 20, 1918. He served in France with the American Expeditionary Forces and attaining the rank of major in the Army reserves. He participated in the Meuse–Argonne offensive and became friends with Gen. John J. Pershing. He received the Victory Medal with two battle clasps for his service. Messler remained active in Army reserve organizations, retiring as a colonel in 1947.
In 1898, Messler married Elizabeth Verner Long. They had two sons: Thomas Doremus Messler and Eugene Lawrence Messler Jr.
Messler was the victim of a hit-and-run driver in approximately 1945, which significantly impacted his health. He died in 1950 at age 76 at Pittsburgh's West Penn Hospital. The cause of death was intestinal obstruction, and he is buried in Homewood Cemetery.

WWE 2K19

WWE 2K19 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and published by 2K Sports. It was released worldwide on October 9, 2018, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the twentieth game made in the "WWE" game series (sixth under the "WWE 2K" banner), and the successor to "WWE 2K18". "WWE 2K19" was the last WWE game to be developed by Yuke's after 18 years of being in development within the franchise. A sequel, "WWE 2K20", was released on October 22, 2019, this time being developed by Visual Concepts.
Gameplay.
In an interview with "Hardcore Gamer", WWE 2K creative director Lynell Jinks stated that "WWE 2K19" would be moving away from the simulation-styled gameplay of the last four WWE games, in favor of faster, more fluid gameplay, saying "[The fans] kind of got turned off by the product we were giving them and we had to think outside the box and they never thought that we'd do it. The core was simulation, and people got turned off by that and we were hearing loud and clear that they weren't buying it anymore and that was the driving force behind all of that." He added "We were hearing from the fanbase that it was too slow, too sluggish and it wasn't any fun anymore."
Game modes.
WWE 2K19 features many different returning and new game modes, including the 2K Showcase Mode, focusing on the career of Daniel Bryan. This is the first Showcase to be featured in the series since "WWE 2K17"'s Hall of Fame Showcase DLC. Players take control of 11 different unique models of Daniel Bryan, in 11 matches, including his "Velocity" match against John Cena.
Two new "Tower" modes are present in "2K19". In MyPlayer Towers mode, wrestlers or created superstars can participate in challenges online or offline. Daily, Weekly and Pay-Per-View challenge towers are also introduced. In WWE Towers, There are two types of Towers including the Gauntlet Tower, where players must complete the Tower entirely in one session. Losing a match or quitting resets the progress to square one. In the Steps Tower, the players' progress is saved after each match, so they can play at their own pace.
MyCareer mode has been reinvented with the focus of a more linear storyline that centers the player's created character as an aspiring wrestler, working his way up from independent wrestling promotions to the WWE. Barron Blade, a fictional character featured in previous MyCareer modes, also returns and acts as the created player's guide.
The "Road to Glory" mode returns from previous entries, with the ability to now join one of eight different factions.
Release.
On June 15, 2018, 2K announced "WWE 2K19".

On June 25, 2018, Rey Mysterio was announced as one out of two pre-order bonus characters. On July 9, 2018, "Rowdy" Ronda Rousey was confirmed as the second pre-order bonus character.
On July 25, 2018, 2K revealed the WWE 2K19's Collector's Edition that would be based on Ric Flair, titled the "Wooooo! Edition".

One week later, the soundtrack was revealed in a livestream hosted by The New Day, alongside Elias and rapper Wale.

Reception.
"WWE 2K19" received "generally favorable" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.
The game was nominated for "Fan Favorite Sports/Racing Game" at the Gamers' Choice Awards, and for "Sports, Racing or Fighting Title of the Year" at the Australian Games Awards.
IGN rated 2K19 a 7.3 out of 10, saying, "It's still held back by a number of longstanding issues. But with the much improved MyCareer mode, and the sheer amount of content available thanks to the return of Showcase Mode and the addition of 2K Towers, it stops the downward spiral of the series and puts it back on track."

Polar Star (airplane)

Polar Star is the airplane used by polar explorer Lincoln Ellsworth, an early adaptor of airplanes for polar exploration and worked closely with Robert Peary.
"Polar Star" was an all-metal Northrop Gamma, which had a low-wing, reducing the effects of winds and wide skis that could be swapped with wheels or pontoons and a cruising range of .
"Polar Star" shipped to the Antarctic in 1934 on HMAS Wyatt Earp, based in Norway. Australian explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins was the advisor and Norwegian-American explorer Bernt Balchen served as the first pilot. The expedition reached the Bay of Whales by ship on 6 January 1934, and Ellsworth intended to make a round-trip flight with Balchen between the Bay of Whales and the Weddell Sea. However, the skis broke on the ice.
In September 1934 a second attempt to fly "Polar Star" in the Antarctic was unsuccessful as well.
Finally, in late 1935, Ellsworth's third attempt with a new pilot, Herbert Hollick-Kenyon, was successful. The aircraft flew for 14 hours and, although the fuselage was damaged on landing, the aircraft was able to fly again.
For this achievement, Ellsworth was awarded the National Geographic Society’s Hubbard Medal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in April 1936 for distinction within exploration, discovery and research. Also in 1936 he was declared an honorary member of the Norwegian Geographical Society.
In 1936, Ellsworth donated "Polar Star" to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. It is now housed at the National Air and Space Museum.

Structural competency

Structural competency is a term used in American health professional education to describe the ability of health care providers and trainees to appreciate how symptoms, clinical problems, diseases and attitudes toward patients, populations and health systems are influenced by 'upstream' social determinants of health.
The creators of this term Jonathan Metzl and Helena Hansen proposed a 5-point model .
The concept of structural competency is framed in the language of competency based medical education and is proposed as a new iteration of cultural competency which is a defined competency in American medical, nursing and public health education.

KiHa 35

The , along with the similar KiHa 30 and KiHa 36 series, are Japanese diesel multiple unit (DMU) train types formerly operated by the Japanese National Railways (JNR) and JR Group of companies, and later operated by the private railway operators Kanto Railway and Mizushima Rinkai Railway. They were built from 1961 until 1966, and were widely used around Japan. Most units were withdrawn in 2012 with the exception of those used by private railways, which remained in service. Some were later operated by Philippine National Railways on Bicol Commuter Train since 2015, and on Metro South Commuter services since 2017.
History.
About 410 cars were built from 1961 to 1966.
After about 50 years of service, they were replaced by newer railcars. The last units, 30 62, 30 98 and 30 100, were withdrawn from service in December 2012. The units used on Kururi Line services were withdrawn on 1 December 2012, and were replaced by KiHa E130 series units.
Variants.
Multiple variants of the KiHa 35 were built, like the KiHa 30 and KiHa 36. The KiHa 35 Series were built to a single cab design, and has toilets, while the KiHa 30 series were built to a double cab design without toilets.
Specifications.
The car bodies are made of steel, with a length of and a width of . Stainless steel construction is used for some sub-variants. They are fitted with Cummins DMH17 diesel engines. The Kururi Line units used DMF14-HZ engines.
Overseas operations.
Philippine National Railways.
In September 2015, six former Kantō Railway Joso Line KiHa 35 railcars were transferred to Philippine National Railways for use on Bicol Commuter and Metro Commuter services. On 14 and 16 September 2015, KiHa 350 Set 1 and Set 2 were sent to Naga to serve the Bicol Commuter Line.
They are divided into three two-car sets.
Sets 1 and 2 started commercial operation in September 2015 and served the Naga–Legaspi route of the Bicol Commuter Line in the Bicol Region. Because of the steep slopes on the line, they are now pulled by a locomotive.
The third formation (KiHa 3519-3518) was stored at Tayuman shed and is used as a spare car from 2015 to 2017. After two years, it entered service in September 2017, but it takes only one or two round trips a day because of its existence as a spare car.
On the 1st of August, 2018, PNR KiHa 350 Set 3 was used for the soft opening of the Caloocan-Dela Rosa Line.
In 2019, PNR KiHa 350 Set 3 was given a new livery with the use of sticker-wrap and its windows got replaced with polycarbonate panels, removing the need of window grills. On 16 October 2020, DEL 5009 helped KiHa 350 Set 3 on its transfer to Naga, Camarines Sur, Bicol. Set 3's purpose of transfer to Naga is to serve the Bicol Commuter Line. Set 3 has been servicing the Bicol Commuter Line ever since it went to Naga in 2020.
Resale.
Aizu Railway.
In 1999, Aizu Railway bought a surplus diesel vehicle from JR East's KiHa 30-18 which was supposedly to be scrapped in 1996 to be modified &amp; converted as a sightseeing diesel car and reclassified as AT-300 series rolling stock. It was remodeled inside Niigata, Japan into chartered-type train which attract tourists to generate better income due to the number of passengers decreased due to the economic slowdown in the late 1990s and the impact on the local economy was large, so it was necessary to take measures to increase transportation demand, such as Okawa Valley It was planned to introduce additional trains for the purpose of appreciating the scenery along the railroad . Due to the business situation of the Aizu Railway, it was difficult to introduce sightseeing vehicles on its own. It appeared as Japan's first self-propelled minecart. It started operation on April 29, 1999, and in the first year it was operated with AT-300 series and AT-150 series coupled together with the same paint livery so that the passengers could evacuate in case of rain, The AT-103 series was also remodeled from July 2000 as a two-car train to be coupled with the AT-103 series . However, The AT-400 series was introduced as a "Oza Toro Train" from 2003 as an observation vehicle as a "Torokko train" of the three-car train was added to Aizuwakamatsu – Aizukōgen-Ozeguchi Station was operated between July 12, 2003, where the 13th day express Abukuma been headed over to, Hobara Station – Tsukinoki Station. It was operated two round trips each day. But in 2009, it was replaced by AT-350 series and is currently stored in the Ashinomaki Onsen Station as of now.
Kanto Railway.
Kanto Railway's former JR East KiHa 30/35 railcars were renumbered from 1988 to 1993.
KiHa 35 (1988–93)
KiHa 30 (1988–89)
Mizushima Rinkai Railway.
In 2014, The KiHa 30 98 and 30 100 were transferred to the Mizushima Rinkai Railway, where they entered service from 12 May 2014.
Preserved examples.
Three KiHa 30 and 35 railcars are preserved in the following areas.

SpaceX fairing recovery program

The SpaceX fairing recovery program was an experimental program by SpaceX, begun in 2017 in an effort to determine if it might be possible to economically recover and reuse expended launch vehicle payload fairings from suborbital space. The experimental program became an operational program as, by late 2020, the company was routinely recovering fairings from many flights, and by 2021 were successfully refurbishing and reflying previously-flown fairings on the majority of their satellite launches.
During the early years of the program, SpaceX attempted to catch the descending payload fairings, under parachute, in a very large net on a moving ship in the Atlantic ocean east of the Space Coast of Florida. Two former platform supply vessels—Ms.Tree, formerly known as Mr.Steven, and its sister ship, Ms.Chief—were chartered by SpaceX and used 2018–2021 as experimental platforms for recovery of rocket fairings from Falcon 9 orbital launch trajectories. These fast ships were retrofitted with large nets intended to catch fairings—and prevent the fairings from making contact with seawater—as part of an iterative development program to create technology that will eventually allow rocket payload fairings to be economically reused and reflown. "Ms.Tree" was used for SpaceX Falcon 9 fairing recovery experiments on a number of occasions in 2018 and early 2019, while named "Mr.Steven". "Ms.""Tree" first successfully caught a fairing on 25 June 2019 during Falcon Heavy launch 3, which carried the DoD's STP-2 mission. This was the ship's first fairing recovery voyage after its renaming, change of ownership, and net upgrade. By 2020, the program reached operational status where fairings from most Falcon 9 satellite launches were recovered, either "in the net" or from the water, and for the first time, both fairing halves of a single flight were caught in the nets of two different ships. The final fairing that was successfully caught in a net was in October 2020.
In early 2021, the nets were removed from the two fast ships and SpaceX ended the ship leases, with both ships returned to their owner. 
SpaceX found that recovery of the ("wet") fairings from floating on the ocean surface was adequate to support economic reuse of payload fairings on subsequent Falcon 9 launches. After the end of the experimental program, SpaceX entered an operational phase of the program, and is using the contracted ship Shelia Bordelon and Hos Briarwood to recover parachute-descended payload fairings that reached the sea surface in good condition, and are floating on the water, using a large crane. Later SpaceX purchased these two ships for towing and supporting droneships and fairing recovery operations on the east coast in May 2021. These two ships were named in honour of Demo-2 astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken as Doug and Bob respectively for their contribution to SpaceX. The earlier names of the ships Bob and Doug were Ella G and Ingrid respectively. Currently, Doug is operating at Port Canaveral while Bob is at Tampa undergoing construction.
SpaceX performs some amount of cleaning and refurbishing before using the previously-flown fairings on a subsequent flight.
History.
Ms. Tree was originally built in 2014 for SeaTran as a platform supply vessel to support fast crew transport operations. The vessel was named "Mr.Steven" after Steven Miguez, the father of SeaTran CEO Blake J. Miguez.
The vessel subsequently was chartered by SpaceX in 2018 for an experimental program to provide surface marine "catch and recovery" operations for a test program attempting to bring the large Falcon 9 launch vehicle satellite fairingsseparated at high speed and high altitudethrough atmospheric reentry and parachute descent to the ocean surface in a controlled way, and then recover them for evaluation and potential reuse. Since satellite fairings are traditionally expended into the ocean, the fairings used for these tests were somewhat modified test articles. As part of that effort, "Mr.Steven" was fitted in July 2018 with four large arms which support an elevated horizontal net, similar to a giant trampoline or trapeze net.
In July 2018, "Mr.Steven" was upgraded and refitted with a much larger net with an area of , four times the original net size. The upgrade included replacing the original rigid arms and fitting four new arms, which are each supported and positioned by two extendable shock-absorbing booms. Each arm can be removed and disassembled into six subsections. 
In June 2019, "Mr.Steven" was renamed "Ms.Tree" (a play on the word mystery), after being purchased by Guice Offshore (GO), a company with a long-standing contractual relationship to SpaceX as a provider of a variety of marine services.&lt;ref name="https://www.teslarati.com/spac..."&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 25, 2019, SpaceX successfully caught its first fairing half on "Ms.Tree" in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida coast as part of the Falcon Heavy STP-2 mission.
On August 6, 2019, "Ms.Tree" was used to successfully catch another fairing half from a Falcon 9 that successfully launched Amos-17. SpaceX now had two complete fairing halves that have reentered from space and been recovered dry, without contacting the saltwater. Although a dry recovery is preferable to maintain a cleaner environment inside the fairing to protect future payloads, eventually SpaceX would drop it as a requirement.
In August 2019, SpaceX chartered the sister ship to "Ms.Tree", the "Ms.Chief" (a play on the word mischief), as the second fairing catcher vessel so that it could be possible to retrieve both halves of the same fairing on a Falcon 9 launch. This second ship is also operated by Guice Offshore, and is therefore titled "GO Ms.Chief" on the ship sides. "Ms.Chief" was outfitted with a matching set of four wide arms and a catch net by October 2019, in preparation for dual simultaneous fairing recovery attempts. 
On 11 November 2019, during the Starlink L1 mission both ships were sent to sea but were recalled due to rough seas so a recovery was not attempted.
On 16 December 2019, both ships were positioned in the Atlantic ocean for a recovery attempt, but both ships narrowly missed catching the fairing halves.
On 29 January 2020, both ships were positioned for a recovery attempt for the Starlink 3 launch. "Ms.Tree" caught one fairing half, but "Ms.Chief" narrowly missed the other fairing half.
On 20 July 2020, both fairing halves were successfully caught for the first time by both ships during the Anasis-2 mission.
The final payload fairing ever caught by SpaceX was in October 2020 on the Starlink v1.0 L13 mission.
In February 2021, both ships were taken out of service to have their catching arms removed. On 6 April 2021, the ship departed Port Canaveral for the final time with a water salute.
SpaceX abandoned the experimental program to recover descending-under-parachute payload fairings dry, in a net on a fast ship, by April 2021. SpaceX has decided to do "wet recovery" of fairings on future Falcon 9 flights, having found that they can clean, refurbish, and reuse such fairings more economically, and so they purchased two ships and named them "Bob" and "Doug". Simultaneously with fairing recovery, they will also support booster towing and recovery missions.
Fairing reuse.
During the first six decades of spaceflight, payload fairings were expended by atmospheric reentry and allowed to drop into the ocean as debris.
In 2018, SpaceX began flight test experiments with fairings descending from sub-orbital trajectories above the atmosphere on its Falcon 9 rockets.
As a part of the SES-10 mission in March 2017, SpaceX successfully performed a controlled landing of the payload fairing into the ocean for the first time. SpaceX was able to recover the fairing half from the water after it landed, aided by attitude-control thrusters and a steerable parachute, gently on water. At the SES-10 news conference, the company announced its intent to land the fairings on a dry flexible structure, jokingly described by Elon Musk as a "floating bouncy castle", with the goal of reusing the fairings. The cost of a fairing is about $6 million which accounts for 10 percent of overall Falcon 9 launch costs.
The "bouncy castle" idea led to SpaceX contracting for the fast vessel "Mr.Steven" which was subsequently modified to facilitate a large net being strung between long arms that extend considerably beyond the width of the ship. "Mr.Steven" was equipped with a dynamic positioning system and was first tested after the launch of the Paz satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base in February 2018. The test was not fully successful because the fairing missed the boat by a few hundred meters but landed safely in the water before being recovered and taken back to port. All four attempts in the first half of 2018 to land a fairing on the recovery ship failed, despite fitting "Mr.Steven" with larger nets before the July 2018 attempt.
In October 2018, to practice recovery outside mission situations, SpaceX performed drop tests of a fairing half from a helicopter with "Mr.Steven" below. The outcome of the tests has not been publicly released.
On the ArabSat-6A mission on April 11, 2019, SpaceX used the recovery boats "GO Searcher" and "GO Navigator" to recover both fairing halves quickly after they landed in the sea; Musk declared the recovery successful and reused the fairings in a later Starlink mission. SpaceX used the same recovery method in May 2019 on another Starlink launch. 
The first successful fairing catch was made as part of the STP-2 mission on 25 June 2019. The final payload fairing ever caught in a net was in October 2020 on the Starlink v1.0 L13 mission, and fairings began to more frequently be scooped out of the ocean.
By January 2021, SpaceX had modified the design of the fairing to better accommodate water recoveries. The ascent vents on the fairing halves were moved closer to the seam between the two fairing halves "so that water is less likely to enter the fairing through the holes when the halves are floating in the ocean." By April 2021, the company had publicly abandoned net recovery and switched to water recovery as an ordinary operational practice.

Indonesian National Armed Forces Day

The Indonesian National Armed Forces Day ("Hari Tentara Nasional Indonesia", formerly "Hari Angkatan Perang RI/Angkatan Bersenjata RI") abbreviated HUT TNI is a national day of Indonesia that is celebrated on 5 October, the day of foundation of the Tentara Keamanan Rakyat (People's Security Armed Forces), the predecessor of the TNI, in 1945, itself a replacement for the Badan Keamanan Rakyat (People's Security Bureau) established on 29 August the same year. Military parades, fun games, concerts and other events are held nationwide in major cities and provincial capitals in honor of the INAF's serving men and women and military veterans.
History of Armed Forces Day.
The date of October 5 was chosen for the National Armed Forces Day in honor of the 1945 establishment of Southeast Asia's 5th oldest regular and standing armed forces per a government decree of the nascent Republic. The first ever parades, albeit in wartime conditions of the Indonesian National Revolution, was held in Yogyakarta in 1946, no parades were held in 1948 while a victory parade was held in 1949 in lieu of the anniversary parade, owing to the conclusion of military operations. It would be only in 1950 when the first regular parade was held in Jakarta, the national capital, to celebrate the 5th year of the armed forces and the adoption of the unitary status of the young country and they have been held annually ever since (with a break in 1965, when due to the aftermath of the events of the 30 September Movement a few days before the 20th Armed Forces Day, it was cancelled at the last minute but was made up the day after, parades were also not held in 1997, 1999 and 2016). From 1961 to 1998 the Indonesian National Police, as the then 4th branch of the armed forces, joined the parades, and flypasts have been held since 1951. The national parade's guest of honor is the President of Indonesia in his/her capacity as Commander in Chief of the National Armed Forces. While in Jakarta the parade has been held at the Halim Perdanakusuma AFB and formerly at the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex and the DPR/MPR Building complex.
Since 2014, to place emphasis on the role of the armed forces in the modern era and in the modernization and expansion of its combat units the holiday parades have now been held outside of the capital and have also included a fleet review.
Expanded summary.
As Armed Forces Day is the national armed forces holiday of Indonesia the celebrations in Jakarta or other major cities thus serve as a national event to mark the holiday. The celebrations begin as the parade commander (The commander is, in recent years, as in the case in 2015 and 2017, been led by a Lieutenant General/Vice Admiral/Air Marshal, usually the commanding general of Kostrad) arrives to take his place in the parade formation. The parade first renders honors to the Tri-Service Colour Guard ("Pasukan Penjaga Lambang-Lambang Kesatuan") as the Paspampres Presidential Band plays honors music, if a massed colour guard unit is present the honors are the same.
At 10:00 am the President and Vice President arrive together with the Minister of Defense in the dais, where they are received by the Commander of the Armed Forces. The parade then first salutes as the band plays Indonesia Raya, and then to the President as arrival honors are rendered. The PC then informs him/her of the commencement of the parade and ceremony and the readiness of the formations for the review. The president, riding in an open-top Land Rover, then inspects the formations with the PC and as the review ends, leaves the vehicle and returns to the dais, where he/she orders a minute of silence ("mengheningkan cipta") in honor of all armed forces personnel who were killed in action and to deceased veterans of the armed services. When the band stops playing the "Sapta Marga" (Armed Forces Pledge) is recited in a rededication service, wherein 3 select officers renew the pledge on behalf of all servicing men and women of the armed forces. Afterwards, before the President would make the holiday address, he/she first awards 3 armed forces personnel with the following decorations, each per service branch, for merit and dedicated service to the nation and people in the armed forces:
"Andika Bhayangkari" is played after the address by the band, and this is followed by the PC receiving permission from the President to march off the parade in preparation for the march past later on, the departure honors then follow.

MediaBanda

MediaBanda is a Chilean musical group that is characterized by its eclectic and energetic proposal, nourished by several styles such as rock, jazz, funk, pop, latin american fusion and contemporary music, among others. It was formed in the year 2000 in Santiago de Chile by saxophonist and composer Cristián Crisosto. The ensemble's line-up is an expanded rock band that has varied in time but usually has a woodwind section as protagonists in addition to lead voices and a refined rhythm section. 
Name.
The name of the band, MediaBanda, means literally "half band" in spanish language, hinting to be half of a big band, however in Chilean Spanish, the term "media" is used as big, huge, as well as awesome and impressive. Therefore the meaning of MediaBanda might be "Awesome Band".
History.
Formation (2000–2002).
A first band named MediaBanda and formed by Pato Zúñiga, Cristián Crisosto, Jaime Vivanco, Willy Valenzuela, Raúl González, Sergio Pinto, and Miguel Schain, began to operate at the beginning of the 1980s as a group that explored the fusion of rock, funk, jazz, and free improvisation, also inspired in Rock in Opposition movement. From this formation there was only one unpublished demo. However, when Crisosto and Vivanco joined the rest of the final members, decided to make new music and change the name to "Fulano", starting a great career from 1984 to 2015, leaving an indelible mark in the history of Chilean music. It is later to the album "Trabajos Inútiles" (Useless Works, 1997) by Fulano that Cristián Crisosto began an ambitious personal composition project, which in the year 2000 is concretized by putting together a new band, with his wife Arlette Jequier (voice), their daughter Regina Crisosto (voice), and seven other young musicians; Santiago Astaburuaga, (bass), Christian Hirth (drums), Daniel Linker (piano), Diego Aguirre (guitar), Sebastián Dintrans (guitar), Patricio Bracamonte (trombone), Marcelo Maira (flute and sax), taking up the previous name of MediaBanda. This is how the current Mediabanda was born.
First period (2003–2010).
After a long period of rehearsals and workshop work to put together the complex compositions of Crisosto, Mediabanda launched in June 2004 its first album entitled "Entre la inseguridad y el ego" (Between Insecurity and Ego), financed thanks to the support of Fondart with a concert in the theater of the Centro Arte Alameda. The album stands out for its great musical eclecticism, compositional complexity and richness of sound, in songs that walk with ease through rock, funk, salsa, afro-latin rhythms, pop melodies, jazz arrangements, avant-garde music and even at times, classical music. At the end of 2004, the faculty of the Escuela Moderna de Música awarded MediaBanda the prize for best band of the year, and Wikén magazine of the newspaper El Mercurio qualifies the group as the best new Chilean artist. As a result of the reception of the critics and the public, they are invited to participate in the 4th Providencia Jazz International Festival, sharing the stage with international artists such as Paquito D'Rivera, Yellowjackets, Lito Vitale and others. Later they would also act in Centro Cultural Matucana 100 next to Akineton Retard, between other presentations of the period. In April 2005 he won his second Fondart project, which included a national tour that took place during the months of October and November.
In April 2006, they won for the third time a Fondart project to finance their second record production "Dinero y Terminación Nerviosa" (Money and nerve endings) which was recorded in January 2007 and launched in June of the same year in two concerts at the Centro Arte Alameda. The album was a double CD where their style of fusion rock, jazz, and contemporary music develops, consolidating the group as one of the most important of the Latin American progressive fusion style. This time the composition was also open to Hirth and Dintrans, in addition to notable experimental improvisations from Jequier, Hirth and Astaburuaga. A week later, they embark on a trip to Europe for a month and a half, performing in various halls, auditoriums and festivals such as the "Nuits du Sud Festival" in Vence France, and others in Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria and Italy. Upon returning to Chile, they would perform at the Teatro Oriente next to Congreso and Akineton Retard. Later also with the experimental percussion group Code, in the same theater.
In 2010 they released a new album called "Siendo Perro" (Being dog), with a new line-up which highlights the harmonic use of guitars as a replacement for the piano, and the incorporation of funk, and hard rock to the already avant-garde jazz-rock fusion. "Siendo Perro" was released without the voice of Arlette Jequier, what glimpsed the beginning of the breaks within the band and that led to a silence of more than two years.
Second period (2013 – present).
In mid-2013, a new line up for the second age of MediaBanda was gathered, including six new members. In 2014 they participate in the celebration of the 30 years of the Fulano group, held at the Nescafé Theater of Arts together with "Santiago del Nuevo Extremo", Pedro Foncea (from "De Kiruza"), and Angelo Pierattini (from "Weichafe"). During this period the group made a series of performances re-opening a large part of the repertoire, which also had the collaboration of Consuelo Schuster and Celeste Shaw in voices and that coincided with an important rotation of musicians in the base formation.
During 2016 they composed and recorded their highly anticipated new album, "Bombas en el Aire" (Bombs in the Air), which premiered in January 2017 in a crowded Sala SCD in Plaza Egaña. The following week they are presented with great success at the Woodstaco Festival 2017 in Maule Region, before thousands of people, then continuing the album presentations in Valparaíso Region. It was recorded in CHT Estudios as a musical workshop experiment instead of the usage of scores that had been the fundamental support in the early days. During the months of July and August they went on tour to Mexico which included presentations in the "Jalisco Jazz Festival" in Guadalajara, the "FestivAlterNativo" in Querétaro, in addition to the cultural circuit of Mexico City. Back in Chile, they performed a series of presentations with other avant-garde bands such as "Crisis" (by Nicolás Vera and Cristián Gallardo), "Sube", "Zet", "Cola de Zorro", and "Ojo de Pez" among others. In January 2018, they participated in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the "Woodstaco Festival" in Teno.
Since late 2018 they are presenting the show "Mediabanda Plays Fulano", premiered on November 16, 2018 at the Teatro Oriente with guests such as Pablo Ilabaca (from "Chancho en Piedra"), Nicolás Vera, Consuelo Schuster, and "Como asesinar a Felipes", paying tribute to the music of the mythical chilean fusion band Fulano, and in particular to the great maestro Jaime Vivanco, performed with new arrangements by Tomás Ravassa on keyboards, and Aurelio Silva on guitar, in a staging that wastes energy and attitude. Given their success, they have continued to perform at venues such as the Valparaíso and Quilpué Jazz Festivals, Teatro San Joaquín, and La Batuta in Ñuñoa. In January 2020 they release the first single from their upcoming new album entitled "Maquinarias" (Machinery) in tribute to Fulano, with the classic anti-athoritarian satire "", at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights and in the context of the Social Outbreak. After production delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the album "Maquinarias" was finally released on July 1st, 2021, on streaming and CD. The album is dedicated to composer Jaime Vivanco who tragedly died in 2003, and contains ten new arrangements of his compositions in Fulano, which had the collaboration of the Ilabaca brothers (from Chancho en Piedra), the actor and folklorist Daniel Muñoz, and singer Consuelo Schuster, among others.
Musical style.
Cristian Crisosto's main influences have been American composer Frank Zappa and the European Rock in opposition movement. Weather Report, Return to Forever, Magma, King Crimson, Hermeto Pascoal, Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk have also been important influences. Many other acts of different origins and styles have been significant too such as Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Charly García, and most notably Crisosto's former band Fulano. In addition to all these influences, there are those that each talented member of the band has had and that have served as essential contributions to the sound of the ensemble.
MediaBanda has been called by the prestigious musicologist Juan Pablo González as "anti-hegemonic eclecticism", since many influences are noticeable but none of them predominates over the other ones. Roughly point out as jazz-rock, MediaBanda has explored many elements of different subgenres and music styles in its five studio albums experience such as chamber rock, progressive rock, baroque pop, pop rock, soul rock, funk rock, hard rock, art rock, alternative rock, latin rock, punk jazz, post punk, fusion jazz, jazz funk, latin jazz, rapcore, latin american fusion, experimental music, classical music, contemporary music, avant-garde music, atonal music, and free improvisation.

Chronicle of a Corpse Bearer

Chronicle of a Corpse Bearer is a 2012 novel written by author and playwright Cyrus Mistry. Set in pre-Independence era of India, the book is about the Parsi community of corpse bearers who carry the dead bodies for burial in Bombay. The idea for the novel came to Mistry in 1991, when he was researching the subject for a film producer, who wanted to make a documentary on it by Channel 4. The film could not be made so Mistry decided to write it as a novel.
"Chronicle of a Corpse Bearer" won the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature in 2014 and the Sahitya Akademi Award for English in 2015.
Plot.
Phiroze Elchidana is a Parsi corpse bearer aka "khandhias" of the Parsi community whose job is to collect the dead, perform the last rites and rituals before the corpses are left to decay or consumed by the vultures. The son of a priest who is inept at his studies, Phiroze compounds his family’s disappointment by falling in love with Sepideh, the daughter of a khandhia. He later marries her and becomes a corpse bearer himself. Sepideh dies, leaving Phiroze and his daughter in sorrow.
Reception.
Writing for "Daily News and Analysis", Aditi Sheshadri called it an "interesting and uncommon account of social discrimination" but further said that it is not the "stirring, dramatic, intensely personal tale of love and loss that it could have been." Mahvesh Murad of "Dawn" wrote: ""Chronicle of a Corpse Bearer" is not a perfect book, but it is an important one." Jai Arjun Singh said in his review that the novel "reads less like a well-paced, internally consistent novel and more like fragmented socio-history, trying to say too much about too many things." Bakhtiar K. Dadabhoy of "Outlook" said, "Peppered with grey humour, irony and tragedy, this well-crafted book is a winner."

Nicola Shaw CBE is executive director at National Grid. She has previously held roles as chief executive of High Speed 1 and director of FirstGroup. She was awarded a CBE in the Queen's New Year's Honours List 2015.
Education.
Shaw attributes her fascination with transport to her father, a stockbroker who commuted to London Bridge from Oxted, Kent. She attended Croydon High School and The King's School, Canterbury. Shaw studied History and Economics at Lincoln College, Oxford. She completed a Master of Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and graduated in 1995
Career.
Shaw joined Transport for London in 1990. She was partly responsible for the Stratford bus station, the first not to be constructed of red brick. Shaw then completed a master's degree in interdepartmental transport at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The program focused on civil engineering, the importance of transport and teamwork. In 1995 Shaw joined World Bank. She worked at Halcrow Group, where she advised Dubai, Singapore and Malaysia on transport projects. She returned to the UK in 1999, where she was deputy chief economist and director of Access, Competition and Licensing at the Office of the Rail Regulator. In 2002 she joined Bechtel to lead business development.
In 2003 she was appointed managing director of operations at the Strategic Rail Authority, where she was responsible for the contractual negotiations between the government and private sector train operators. She joined FirstGroup in 2005, where she was managing director of the bus division. From 2005 to 2010, she was responsible for 25,000 staff in the bus division and £1.3 billion revenue.
Between 2010 and 2015 she was a non-executive director of Aer Lingus.

Patrick McLoughlin said publicly that he "welcomes Ms Shaw’s suggestions". When asked by Rail Professional what it was like to be a woman working on the railway, Shaw replied "I have no idea what it's like to be a woman in this industry because I've always been one and I've always been in transport ... People do ask that question but if I asked you what is it like to be a man in the rail industry, you would give me the same answer, I think."
In March 2016 Shaw was appointed executive director at National Grid plc. She is interested in how the patterns of energy use are changing, and working on improving transparency and efficiency in energy balance and the transmissions network (National Grid). She is working with DeepMind to use Artificial intelligence in the future of Utilities. She is working to improve diversity at National Grid plc, where 30% of senior management are women.

Singing Away the Hunger

Singing Away the Hunger: The Autobiography of an African Woman is a 1996 autobiography by Mosotho woman Mpho 'M'atsepo Nthunya, edited by K. Limakatso Kendall.
Nthunya, a Lesotho elder and matriarch, spent three decades as a domestic worker, supporting eleven people on her income. At the University of Natal, she met and befriended Kendall, an American writer on a Fulbright scholarship. Becoming friends, the two collaborated to record Nthunya's life story.
Nthunya was born in 1930. Impoverished as a child, she often lacked clothing, shoes, and food, occasionally having to eat grass. She was able to freely attend Catholic grade school in South Africa, ultimately learning to read and speak eight languages. She modeled her life and faith on that of her Roman Catholic mother, but also maintained traditional beliefs in magic, wizards, and illness-causing spells. As an adult, Nthunya dealt with the death of her husband, and the murders of her father, brother, and children. Despite these hardships, Nthunya maintained a "love of natural beauty, as well as her sense of humor, hope, and dreams."
In loosely connected episodes, including stories passed to her from her mother, Nthunya describes the difficult life facing many Basotho women, who must deal with a choice between the dangers, hardships, and degrading working conditions of city life as an indigenous African under apartheid, and the challenges of traditional rural life. In the Basotho community, women often face child mortality, forced marriage, domestic abuse and single parenthood. Illness and starvation are constant threats, and these are compounded by what Nthunya describes as the destructive force of jealousy in impoverished communities. Despite this, Nthunya chose in 1949 to move her family away from city life under apartheid to her rural homeland, so that they could learn the traditions of their people. The cultural conflict between city and rural life, and between Western and traditional culture, are a major theme of the book.
Customs and rituals are a constant guiding force in Basotho life. The Basotho society is a patriarchal one: marriages are arranged without concern for women's preferences, and women are responsible for childcare and management of the household, but may receive little financial support. They live under the control of their husbands or male relatives, including their children. Women who are unable to bear children are stigmatized. With no power over men, women in Basotho society often oppress and victimize their sisters. However, Nthunya cherished the female friendships she had in the society.
Reviews.
"Publishers Weekly" called Nthunya's narration "eloquent", and described her writing as having a "dignified emotional distance... punctuated by her very human humor and pain." "Kirkus" called the book "poignant and beautifully crafted", a "commanding and important work that will captivate readers with its unique voice, narrative power, and unforgettable scenes of life in southern Africa."
In "Women's Studies Quarterly", Nthunya's book was favorably compared with two novels by African writers, "So Long a Letter" by Mariama Bâ and "Petals of Blood" by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, which also deal with themes of women's struggle in patriarchal societies, and that of widows in particular. The stories are said to speak "not only to the personal, not only to the Lesotho, not only to the African, but to the universal female experience."

Sanctuary of Our Lady of Łukawiec

The Most Holy Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland's Church (Polish: Kościół pw. NMP Królowej Polski), also known as Sanctuary of Our Lady of Łukawiec (Polish: Sanktuarium Matki Bożej Łukawieciej) is a Roman Catholic church, in village Łukawiec, in the administrative district of Gmina Wielkie Oczy, within Lubaczów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It was designed by Henryk Stawicki from Cracow and built between 1980 and 1989.
History.
The church is dedicated to Our Lady, Queen of Poland. The Painting of Our Lady of Łukawiec (earlier: Our Lady of Tartaków) from the 17th century is displayed in the main altar.
Previously, the Łukawiec parish church was Three Wise Man Church. However, due to the arrival of more and more believers, a decision was made to build a new church, thanks to the efforts of priest Józef Kornaga. It was built in 1980-1989 according to the design of engineer Henryk Stawicki from Krakow. The church was consecrated by Bishop Marian Jaworski in 1990. The church is brick, built in a modern style. Its shape resembles a boat. In 1990, from the historic church of Epiphany, a miraculous Icon of Our Lady of Łukawiec (earlier: Our Lady of Tartaków) was moved to a new church and placed in the main altar. The church became the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Łukawiec. The altar is located in a triangular niche, narrowing towards the top, supposed to resemble rays descending from the Heaven. In the middle there is a long, rectangular stained-glass window that reaches the roof. On the left side of the altar there is a door to the sacristy, and on the right to the Chapel of St. John Paul II. On May 17, 2011, Bishop Wacław Depo dedicated the new elevation of the church and the presbytery.
In 2013, thanks to the efforts of Archbishop Mieczysław Mokrzycki a chapel of John Paul II was made in the church. Archbishop Mieczysław Mokrzycki was the personal secretary of John Paul II. He made the dedication of the chapel. Thanks to him in the chapel were the relics of the Pope, in the form of a strand of hair, which was placed in a kneeler, and in specially prepared cases there were cassock, piuska, chasuble and chalice.
In 2016, on the occasion of the anniversary celebrations connected with the 25th anniversary of the coronation of the Miraculous Icon of Our Lady of Łukawiec by John Paul II, a new, huge main altar was made. The miraculous Icon of the Blessed Mother was placed there on June 6, 2016 after renovation. The consecration of the new altar was made by archbishop Mieczysław Mokrzycki, who came from Łukawiec, during a solemn mass on June 8, 2016. The altar was designed by Bogusław Kulka and his wife. Masonry work was done by Jerzy Malarczyk, and woodwork by Józef Majerczyk. Anita Kurasińska painted a picture referring to the parish's call - Epiphany. This painting is a veil for the Miraculous Icon of Our Lady of Łukawiec.

Chemeketa Cooperative Regional Library Service

The Chemeketa Cooperative Regional Library Service (CCRLS) is a library cooperative serving residents of the Chemeketa Community College district, which includes most of Polk, Yamhill, and Marion Counties, and a small portion of Linn County in Oregon. The CCRLS offices are located on the campus of the Chemeketa Community College in Hayesville, an unincorporated suburb of Salem, Oregon. The Cooperative works in tandem with the member libraries to determine services, policies, and procedures. The organization is governed by the College Board of Education, with input from the CCRLS Advisory Council, made up of one lay member from each county and one representing the rural areas, five library directors, and one city manager.
Although considered a public library by the State of Oregon, CCRLS has no holdings of its own, but operates as a service overlay coordinating 16 independent and locally owned libraries into a cohesive system able to provide service to all citizens of the District.
History.
In 1972, a $12,000 Library Services and Technology Act grant was given by the Oregon State Library to the Mid-Willamette Valley Council of Governments to fund a study of the library needs of citizens in the tri-county area surrounding Salem, Oregon. At that time, statistics showed that of the 240,500 residents of the area, 100,000 did not have local library service. The plan that developed out of this study recommended implementation of five basic services: a bookmobile, courier service between libraries, a district-wide library card, provision of reference and information service to smaller libraries, and a film circuit service. Unable to fund a bookmobile in the first year of operation, a books-by-mail service was implemented, instead. Initial funding was provided by a 1973 Library Services and Construction Act grant. At that time, the Chemeketa Community College administration was designated the fiscal agent for the grant money funding the new Library Service. The Cooperative began operating in 1974, and in its first two years provided library service to 41,800 previously unserved, rural users. In 1975, special legislation (Oregon Senate Bill 160) authorized community college districts to establish public libraries, clearing the way for CCRLS to operate as a department of Chemeketa Community College.
During its first decade of existence, CCRLS was funded through a series of levies. The Service was highly visible to the public because of the necessity to approach the voters every few years for funding. Services changed in a minor way, with books-by-mail eventually being deleted as a less cost effective service. In 1985 the Chemeketa District voters approved a tax base for the college, a portion of which was dedicated to CCRLS. This created (before the years of property tax limitations), the first stable funding for a public library multi-jurisdictional system in the State of Oregon. This funding allowed CCRLS to pursue library automation, and for the first time, the CCRLS member libraries were linked by a computer network and integrated library system that allowed library users to search all 18 libraries' catalogs at one time, and request material from any of those locations to be delivered to their home library within days.
CCRLS today.
Current CCRLS services include: reimbursement to cities for serving non-city patrons, courier service among libraries, lost book reimbursement, an integrated automated system, net lending reimbursement, a rotating collection of bestsellers for small libraries, and a pass-through grant from State funding for children's services. All direct services to patrons, including bookmobile services, have been discontinued. Instead, CCRLS provides greater service to the member libraries in the form of computer networking and equipment, centralized software administration and support, cataloging services, and payment for numerous online services such as downloadable audio and ebooks, readers' advisory services, language learning software, and access to online databases available through the Oregon State Library.
CCRLS member libraries.
CCRLS membership includes 16 public libraries and one community college library:

2018–2019 Gaza border protests

The 2018–2019 Gaza border protests, by the organiser called the Great March of Return (), were a series of demonstrations held each Friday in the Gaza Strip near the Gaza-Israel border from 30 March 2018 and onwards. The demonstrators demanded that the Palestinian refugees must be allowed to return to lands they were displaced from in what is now Israel. They also protested against Israel's Gaza blockade and United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel.
The first demonstrations were organized by independent activists, but the initiative was soon endorsed by Hamas, the "de facto" rulers of the Gaza Strip, as well as other major factions in Gaza. The activists who planned the Great March of Return intended it to last only from 30 March 2018 (Land Day) to 15 May (Nakba Day) but the demonstrations continued for almost 18 months until Hamas on 27 December 2019 announced that they would be postponed.
Thirty thousand Palestinians participated in the first demonstration on 30 March. Larger protests took place on the following Fridays, 6 April, 13 April, 20 April, 27 April, 4 May, and 11 May — each of which involved at least 10,000 demonstrators — while smaller numbers attended activities during the week.
Most of the demonstrators demonstrated peacefully far from the border fence. Peter Cammack, a fellow with the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued that the march indicated a new trend in Palestinian society and Hamas, with a shift away from violence towards non-violent forms of protest. Nevertheless, groups consisting mainly of young men approached the fence and committed acts of violence directed towards the Israeli side. Israeli officials said the demonstrations were used by Hamas as cover for launching attacks against Israel.
At least 110 Palestinians were killed between 30 March to 15 May 2018, a number of whom were members of various Palestinian militant organizations: an independent United Nations commission set the number of known militants killed at 29 out of the 183. Other sources claim a higher figure, of at least 40. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and live ammunition. According to Robert Mardini, head of Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), more than 13,000 Palestinians were wounded as of 19 June 2018, the majority severely, with some 1,400 struck by three to five bullets. No Israelis were physically harmed from 30 March to 12 May, until one Israeli soldier was reported as slightly wounded on 14 May, the day the protests peaked. The same day, 59 or 60 Palestinians were shot dead at twelve clash points along the border fence, Hamas claimed 50 of them as its militants, and Islamic Jihad claimed 3 of the 62 killed as members of its military wing. Some 35,000 Palestinians protested that day, with thousands approaching the fence.
Israel's use of deadly force was condemned on 13 June 2018 in a United Nations General Assembly resolution. Condemnations also came from human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, B'Tselem, and Amnesty International, and by United Nations officials. Kuwait proposed two United Nations Security Council statements, both blocked by the United States, which called for investigations into Israel's killing of Palestinian protesters. The Israeli government has praised Israeli troops for protecting the border fence. Media coverage of the demonstrations, and what has been termed the "PR battle", has been the object of analysis and controversy. In late February 2019, a United Nations Human Rights Council's independent commission found that of the 489 cases of Palestinian deaths or injuries analyzed only two were possibly justified as responses to danger by Israeli security forces, deeming the rest illegal, and concluded with a recommendation calling on Israel to examine whether war crimes or crimes against humanity had been committed, and if so, to bring those responsible to trial.
Background.
In 2005, Israel withdrew its forces from the Gaza Strip and allowed the Palestinian authority to take control. Despite the withdrawal, Israel still maintains direct external control over everyday life in Gaza, such as the territory's air and maritime space, most of its land crossings, electricity and water supply and other utilities. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), Palestinians in Gaza still remain protected persons under the articles of the Geneva Conventions.
Following the Battle of Gaza in 2007, Hamas took full control over the strip and expelled its rival and current ruler of the West Bank, Fatah. The takeover by Hamas led Israel and Egypt to impose a land, air and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip. The blockade has had disastrous effects on Gaza's population.
After the 2014 Gaza war, the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsened. Hamas struggled to manage civil life in Gaza, and the new leadership under Yahya Sinwar hoped to get the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority to take control of Gaza's civil issues, through the 2017 Fatah–Hamas Agreement, but the agreement failed. According to Israeli journalist Amos Harel, Hamas, which failed to lift the blockade for years, sought to use the demonstrations as a means to get out its strategical crisis, as it found armed conflict with Israel to be ineffective.
The principal demand of the protests was the right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to present-day Israel. A majority of Gaza's population consists of refugees from the 1948 Palestine War and their descendants. Israel rejected any right of return, fearing that Jews would become a minority in Israel if too many Palestinians returned.
Gaza's "no-go zone" and border barrier.
In late 2005, after the Israeli disengagement from Gaza, the Israeli military imposed a "no-go zone" on the interior side of the Israel-Gaza border in response to rocket fire from Gaza falling on Israeli towns. This zone restricts Palestinians from entering "about 17 percent of Gaza's territory, including a third of its agricultural lands", according to HRW. According to the Israel Defense Force (IDF), this is done "to prevent the concealment of improvised explosives and to disrupt and prevent the use of the area for destructive purposes."
The border fence between Gaza and Israel (the separation barrier) is composed of a crude barbed-wire barrier, a brief gap, and then a high "smart fence" with sensors to detect infiltrators. A crowd surging towards the fence could cross the fence in some 30 seconds, according to one of the contractors who built it.
Idea, organization, and strategy.
In 2011, Ahmed Abu Ratima (or Rteima), whose family originate from Ramle, conceived the idea of Palestinians going peacefully to the border fence to demand their right of return to the homes from which they had been displaced.
In early 2018, Gazan journalist Muthana al-Najjar, whose family originate from Salama, pitched a tent near the border, where he stayed for over a month, while others began planting olive tree seedlings in the area. He and others tried to keep the protest independent from Hamas and other political groups, but were overruled when Hamas took over the protest by mass mobilization of Gazans to join the March. Recruitment included calls on television, local media, social media and by word of mouth. Hamas reportedly planned to keep the peace by having plain clothed security personnel move among the protestors to ensure no violence would occur.
The March gained support from Gazan intellectuals like Atef Abu Saif and graduates of Gazan universities, who were said to have drawn inspiration from the examples of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi.
By March 2018, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the faction of Muhammad Dahlan (who was expelled from Fatah in 2011) had endorsed the protests.
The organizers of the event, including the local government authority, Hamas and various Palestinian factions, encouraged thousands of Palestinians to converge on the Israeli border for the 42nd anniversary. While multiple factions endorsed the protests, they all participated under the shared symbol of the Palestinian national flag.
Timeline.
Prior incidents.
In February 2018, four IDF soldiers were injured by an explosive device concealed in a Palestinian flag placed on the Gazan border fence during a Palestinian protest.
On 25 March, the IDF fired some ten Iron Dome missiles to intercept what the IDF sensors interpreted to be rockets, but which later turned out to be high-trajectory machine-gun fire during Hamas military exercises conducted in Gaza, which early reports said was directed towards Zikim.
In the week prior to 30 March, the IDF arrested a suspect who crossed into Israeli territory from northern Gaza; 2 Palestinians were seen near the now-defunct Karni crossing container port trying to set fire to army engineering equipment close to the border fence; a group of four Palestinians infiltrated Israel near Kissufim; and 3 Gazans, armed with grenades and knives, crossed the border and were captured some from the border, near Tze'elim.
30 March 2018.
The first protest took place on 30 March 2018, during the Land Day. Some 30,000 Palestinians took part in the protests which were launched from five tent camps that were set up from the Israel–Gaza barrier, near the no-go zone imposed by Israel. The majority of the demonstrators in the encampments were away from the border security and did not engage in violence. Hundreds of young Palestinians, however, ignored warnings issued by the organizers and the Israeli military to avoid the border zone. When some Palestinians began throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, Israel responded by declaring the Gaza border zone a closed military zone and opening fire at them. The events of the day were some of the most violent in recent years. In one incident, two Palestinian gunmen approached the fence, armed with AK-47 assault rifles and hand grenades, and exchanged fire with IDF soldiers. They were killed and their bodies were recovered by the IDF.
That day, 15 Palestinians were killed by the IDF, in addition to one farmer who was allegedly killed by artillery fire in the morning prior to the protests. The IDF said a tank fired at two men who "acted suspiciously" near the border fence and did not confirm if one of them was killed. The profile of the 15 men who were killed by the IDF was a subject of debate. The IDF published an infographic with the pictures of ten of those killed, saying they were members of militant-terrorist organizations, of the seven were Hamas militants and activists, one was a "global jihad activist" and one was a member of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militant group. Some of them appear in military uniform in their pictures. Hamas, however, said that only five of its members were killed that day, and one of the men the IDF said was a Hamas operative, was a member of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, according to the organization itself. According to the IDF, among those Hamas confirmed were its members were a company commander and an operative in Hamas' tunnel warfare project. Three other Palestinians who were shot on 30 March succumbed to their wounds in the following days. One of them was a member Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The organization said he was unarmed when he was shot.
One notable casualty, and an example of this debate, is a 19-year-old Palestinian who was seen in footage from the protest being shot in his back while holding a tire and running away from the fence. The IDF said he was a member of Hamas, a claim Hamas did not confirm and his family denied, stating he was a restaurant worker. The IDF described the footage as "edited and fabricated". His funeral did not involve the honors usually given to slain Palestinian fighters. Another 20-year-old man was shot, according to his brother, in the head, while smoking a cigarette while standing behind a group of stone throwers.
Disagreement exists also about the number of those injured that day. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, over 1,400 Palestinians suffered injuries. According to various Palestinian medical sources, around 800 were wounded with live ammunition, while the remaining were injured by rubber-coated projectiles and tear gas. The IDF, on the other hand, estimated only a few dozens were injured with live fire.
Protests continued on a lower scale throughout the week following the 30 March events. The IDF continued to fire at Palestinians along the border fence. A video was published in social media on Sunday, 2 April, showing a 19-year-old man among a group of protesters, placing a tire on another burning tire, to make it catch on fire, then waving his hands in celebration. He is then seemingly shot in the head by Israeli soldiers. Palestinian sources reported he was critically wounded.
During the week of 30 March 2018, two Palestinians were killed in two different incidents. In the first, a Palestinian member of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) was shot by Israeli forces after he breached the fence and entered Israel. The IDF published a video from an observation camera, showing the man hitting the fence with what seems to be a metal pipe when four other people stand behind him. He then breaches the fence and enters along with another man, which is when warning shots were probably fired. The video cuts before the man was shot and it is unclear in what circumstances was he shot and killed. In another incident, an Israeli aircraft attacked an allegedly armed Palestinian who approached the fence. The IDF published a video from an observance camera, showing the man walking slowly towards the fence, holding what appears to be an assault rifle. The army also said he was equipped with grenades and a suicide vest. The incident took place before dawn. In addition to these events, on 1 April the IDF arrested four unarmed Palestinians who entered into Israel illegally.
6 April.
Protest organizers and Hamas called for renewed demonstrations on the Israel-Gaza border the following Friday, 6 April. The IDF stated that it intended to use the same force as the preceding week to prevent infiltrations of Israeli territory.
Between 31 March and 6 April, demonstrators gathered tires in Gaza to be burnt on 6 April, in preparation for what was dubbed the "Day of the Tire" (Arabic: "Jumat al-Kawshook") Israeli officials have cautioned that the mass burning of tires along the border can produce environmental harm, calling on the World Health Organization to prevent, what they termed, an "ecological catastrophe".
Thousands of Palestinians joined in 6 April demonstrations; the IDF estimated their number at 20,000 people. Palestinian medical sources reported that 9 Palestinians were killed, 1,350 were injured, and 25 were in critical condition; and that approximately 400 of those injured were hit by live ammunition. Another Palestinian who was shot that day succumbed to his wounds on 9 April.
Among those killed was Yaser Murtaja, a 30-year-old Palestinian photographer, who, according to Palestinian Health Ministry, was shot in the stomach by an Israeli sniper despite wearing a jacket emblazoned with 'press' to identify him as a journalist. According to the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate, seven other Palestinian journalists were injured by the Israelis during that day's protest. Israeli Defense Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said in response that "anyone who flies drones over IDF soldiers puts himself at risk." According to Israeli security sources, Murtaja was an officer in Hamas security apparatus and attempted to smuggle a drone to Gaza in 2015. Hamas, as well as Murtaja's family, denied the allegation. In addition to Murtaja, five other journalists were injured on 6 April, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists: five from live fire and one from a shrapnel.
8 April.
On the evening of 8 April, according to the IDF, three Palestinians infiltrated the fence in the Northern Gaza strip, planted two explosive devices, and then quickly returned to Gaza. The IDF fired at the Palestinians with tank fire.
9 April.
In the early morning of 9 April, the IDF said it attacked a military compound belonging to Hamas in the northern Gaza strip in response to the attempted infiltration with explosives. The IDF said Hamas "is solely responsible for what is happening in the Gaza Strip from above and below the ground".
11 April.
On the morning of 11 April, Palestinians set off a bomb near an Israeli construction vehicle adjacent to the Gaza fence. The IDF fired tank shells at positions that it said belonged to Hamas.
12 April.
On 12 April, Israeli aircraft attacked Hamas targets in the northern Gaza Strip in retaliation for the previous days' bomb attack close to the border fence. Hamas fighters east of Shuja'iyya targeted the aircraft with machine gun fire, and several of the bullets fell on a home in Israel. An Israeli airstrike targeted them, killing one Hamas fighter and wounding another. The Hamas fighter who was killed was identified as Mohammed Hamada Hijila. It was subsequently reported that he had taken part in an infamous raid on an Israeli border post in which five Israeli soldiers had been killed during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict.
13 April.
Protests on a third consecutive Friday were smaller than prior weeks. The IDF estimated that 10,000 people protested on 13 April. Palestinians attempted to breach the border fence, hurled molotov cocktails and explosive devices, and attempted to fly firebomb kites into Israeli territory.
During the protests, the IDF killed three Palestinians:
The Gaza Ministry of Health reported that 969 people were injured by Israeli forces, among them were 67 children, and 223 people hit by live ammunition. Fifteen of the people sustaining live-fire injuries were in critical condition late on 13 April.
14 April.
On 14 April, four Palestinians were killed in a blast near one of the protest camps, the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine said that they were members of the organization and that they died during "preparations".
Several kites with firebombs attached were flown by Palestinians into Israeli territory, sparking several fires, with at least 3 fire bomb kites located on 14 April. No injuries were caused.
15 April.
The IDF said it destroyed a tunnel that crossed the Gaza-Israel border.
16 April.
Additional fire bomb kites were flown from the Gaza strip. One kite started a fire that burned a wheat field on the Israeli side of the border.
20 April.
Protests on Friday, 20 April, have been labeled the "Women's March of Gaza" and were intended to highlight the active role women are playing in the protest. The IDF estimates that 10,000 people participated in protests. At least four Palestinians were killed on 20 April, among them a 15-year-old boy, and over four dozen were injured by Israeli soldiers. Another Palestinian later died of wounds sustained that day. Before the expected protests, the IDF dropped leaflets over Gaza Strip warning anyone against approaching the fence or attempting to damage it.
Five Palestinians were fatally shot on by Israeli live fire on 20 April.
The Gaza Health Ministry reported that 445 people were injured in protests, including 96 who were shot with live ammunition. 174 people were hospitalized while the remainder were treated at clinic tents at the protest sites.
27 April.
According to Israeli military estimates, over 10,000 people gathered to join the day's protest, themed the "Day of Rebellious Youth."
For the first time in the five-week campaign, protesters reached the electrified border fence, having passed a smaller barbed wire barrier; Israeli soldiers fired shots and threw a hand grenade at a group of twelve men climbing the fence, hitting several in the head. A large crowd (the IDF reported "several hundred"; "The New York Times", "thousands") of people rushed toward the Karni border crossing, after a speech by Hamas leader Ismail Radwan. The IDF launched tear gas and opened fire with live ammunition at the crowd, injuring several people. Israeli military sources state that at least two armed Palestinians, among the large crowd, approached the border and fired at least seven rounds at Israeli soldiers. According to "The New York Times", retaliatory Israeli fire, which included a hand grenade, wounded two unarmed protesters.
The Gaza Ministry of Health initially reported that three Palestinians were killed, all of them by bullets to the head. Two more Palestinians later died of wounds suffered on 27 April. Overall, Palestinian reports stated that 884 protesters had been wounded, some 174 by live Israeli fire. Four medical staff and six journalists were among those wounded.
On the night of 27 April, the Israeli Air Force attacked six targets in the Port of Gaza belonging to Hamas naval commando forces, injuring four people. The Israeli army said it was responding to "terror acts and the major attempt to infiltrate the border into Israeli territory earlier in the day."
29 April.
Three separate incidents along the fence occurred during the evening of 29 April between the IDF and Palestinians. In the first incident, the IDF said that two men "attempted to infiltrate" Israel from the southern strip, one was killed and the other captured after being wounded. In the second incident, the IDF said that two men who had crossed the fence "hurled explosive devices" at IDF soldiers before they shot and killed them. In a third incident, two Palestinians with breaching tools and knives were arrested while attempting to breach the fence.
2 May.
A firebomb kite launched from Gaza caused a large fire in the Be'eri Forest, burning hundreds of dunams of woodland. Ten firefighter teams toiled to extinguish and contain the forest fire.
4 May.
Protesters organized for 4 May as the "Friday of the Palestinian Worker," in honor of International Workers' Day earlier in the week. Israeli officials estimated that 10,000 people participated in the protests. Shortly after noon, confrontations began between protesters, who threw stones, burned tires, and launched flammable kites, and Israeli soldiers, who fired tear gas and live ammunition.
By evening, medical officials estimated that 1,100 protesters were injured, including 82 shot with live ammunition, and 800 suffering from the effects of tear gas. Two off-the-shelf drones used by IDF were shot down by Palestinian slingshots. Protesters entered and damaged property used by Israeli forces at Kerem Shalom border crossing; Israeli officials said the property was on the Palestinian side of the border. The damage included burning a pipeline that Israel uses to supply fuel to Gaza.
Palestinians had prepared hundreds of firebomb kites, intending to fly them as swarms into Israel exploiting the heavy heat wave to ignite fires, however since the wind was blowing in the wrong direction to the west. The wind also blew tear gas and smoke from burning tires westwards into the Palestinian crowd chasing many away.
5 May.
Six Hamas operatives were killed in an explosion in Deir al-Balah. A statement by Hamas' military wing blamed Israel – stating that it was a "heinous crime that has been committed against [its] fighters". The IDF spokesperson stated that "the IDF is not involved in this incident in any way". A Palestinian, a source for Haaretz, said that it was "an explosion resulting from the handling of explosives inside a building".
The IDF struck a Hamas outpost in northern Gaza which was used to launch burning objects at Israeli territory. Maj Avichai Adraee tweeted "Attack kites are not a kids' game and we don't see it that way. Hamas is using you [Gazans] and is pushing you toward the circle of terrorism," while Shai Hajaj, head of Merhavim Regional Council in southern Israel, said "When the courts in Jerusalem are discussing petitions from left-wing organizations to tie the hands of the soldiers standing in front of the Gaza protesters who want to break through the fence, the arson continues in the field of farmers... We demand that the IDF stop this [Palestinian] violence immediately".
6 May.
Three Palestinians were killed at the southern end of the Gaza border fence. According to the IDF, they were carrying petrol bombs, an ax, wire cutters, an oxygen mask and gloves.
7 May.
Incendiary balloons launched from the Gaza strip set fire to a wheat field near Mefalsim and to the Be'eri Forest. Similar to the firebomb kites, the incendiary balloon lofted an already-lit Molotov cocktail. The normally prevailing westerly winds propel the balloons to Israel, and the burning Molotov cocktail causes the balloons to explode in midair, with burning material falling to the ground below.
It was reported by Haaretz that Hamas found itself in an "unprecedented" crisis and "dire" situation, and attempting to enter negotiations with Israel about establishing a long-term truce in order to ease the siege of the enclave, and lower tensions, without, as far as it is known, obtaining any clear response from Israel. The Israeli reluctance might, according to defense correspondent Amos Harel, lead to an explosion of rage on the forthcoming occasion of Nakba Day.
11 May.
15,000 demonstrators took part in Friday protests on 11 May. Some of them burned tires, in the hope the smoke would provide cover for saboteurs to destroy and cross the border fence, and threw grenades, pipe bombs and stones at Israeli troops. A 40-year-old Palestinian was killed and 973 were injured, seven of them critically. The IDF used new, small remote-controlled aircraft with knives on their wings to counter incendiary kites launched from Gaza, downing more than 40 kites.
Palestinians broke into the Kerem Shalom border crossing, the main conduit of goods in and of the strip, setting a gas pipeline alight, damaging a fuel pipe, and torching a conveyor belt. The Israeli air force destroyed an underground attack tunnel that reached just a few meters away from the border.
12 May.
Israel announced that the Kerem Shalom border crossing "will remain closed until the damage caused by the riots are repaired and will reopen in accordance with a situation assessment," opening only for humanitarian cases until such a decision is made.
13 May.
Israeli soldiers fired at Palestinians approaching within of the fence. Alaa Asawafiri, a 26-year-old woman who was part of a group of women shouting towards the fence, was shot in the stomach and hospitalised in critical condition.
14 May.
Protests and violence on 14 May coincided with the ceremony marking the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, which international media regarded as the reason for increased tensions. Both events were timed to mark 70 years since the foundation of Israel.
During the protests, the IDF used live fire, leading to 52 Gazan fatalities and injuring more than 1200 (according to Gaza health officials), making it "the bloodiest day in Gaza since the end of the 2014 war." By the end of the day, at least 60 Palestinians were reported to have been killed, when Hamas claim 50 of them as its militants, and Islamic Jihad claimed 3 members of its military wing. Palestinian sources said that about 2700 were injured. Some of those who were killed or injured included health care workers providing medical care to the protesters. One of the wounded subsequently died on 13 August. One Israeli sniper later stated that on this day he and his locator broke the standing record for knee-shots that day, managing to make 42 hits.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that during the day, a Hamas squad attempted to breach the border fence with Israel and opened fire on Israeli forces. All eight attackers were killed by Israeli troops in the exchange of gunfire. The IDF released video of the incident.
The IDF said three of those killed had attempted to plant explosives at the border fence, and that in two incidents Israeli troops opened fire after they were shot at. The Israeli Air Force attacked five Hamas targets in a Jabalia training camp in response to the attempt at planting explosives and shooting at IDF troops. Israel said that "Most of the people killed belonged to the Hamas terror group, and some to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad" and that "at least 24" of the people killed were later identified as known members of terrorist organizations . One Israeli soldier was lightly wounded by what was believed to be a stone thrown by a Palestinian. Likud's Avi Dichter reassured the Knesset that he was not concerned about any possible breach of the border fence since "the IDF has enough bullets for everyone."
Hamas political bureau member Salah al-Bardawi said that 50 of the 62 killed in the protests from 14 to 15 May were Hamas members – adding that these were "official numbers", though he did not specify whether they were members of Hamas' armed or political wing. Speaking to CNN, a Hamas spokesman, Abdel Latif Quanau, said he could not confirm or deny these numbers, and that "The protests are peaceful and include all political and military factions." Amira Hass, an Israeli journalist for Haaretz, received al-Bardawi's statement with skepticism saying that one her friends in Gaza told her that "this [figure of 50] is another typical exaggeration of ours". Islamic Jihad said three members of its Saraya al-Quds military wing were among those killed. An Islamic Jihad official said those killed were unarmed and participating in a legitimate protest.
A spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Rupert Colville, called the killings an "outrageous human rights violation" by Israel. Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said "those responsible for outrageous human rights violations must be held to account". Numerous countries expressed concern with the killings, including Russia, France, Germany, and the UK. Germany, the UK, Ireland, and Belgium called for an independent inquiry. The United States said the deaths were tragic and placed responsibility on Hamas, stating that Israel has the right to defend its borders. South Africa withdrew its ambassador to Israel, citing "the indiscriminate and grave manner of the latest Israeli attack". Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, addressing Turkish students in London in a speech broadcast by Turkey's state television, said that Turkey would recall its ambassadors from Israel and the U.S, and said that Israel's action against Palestinian protesters was "genocide".
This statement started a diplomatic row between Turkish and Israeli leaders, causing the Knesset to propose that Israel officially recognize the killing of over a million Armenians by Ottoman Turkey in the early 20th century as an act of genocide, which modern-day Turkey has never acknowledged. 
15 May.
Protest organizers declared a day of mourning for those killed on the prior day. Fewer people attended protests at the border. One protester was killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The IDF responded to the events with crowd-control means and live ammunition, hurting at least 109 Palestinians, ten of whom from live ammunition, according to medical sources in Gaza. Firebomb kites were also flown by the Palestinians towards Israel and were shot down by Israeli soldiers. Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar visited one of the protest camps.

According to an IDF spokesman, "Saturday's operation aimed to stop arson attacks, attempted border breaches, and assaults on soldiers from Gaza that have grown increasingly violent." Hamas and allied Islamic militant groups fired 100 to 174 projectiles from Gaza into Israel, one mortar struck a synagogue in Sderot.
16 July.
Israeli news media outlets announced that, in response to Firebomb kites flown by Gaza militants, the Israeli government will temporarily suspend deliveries of gas and petrol through the Kerem Shalom border crossing into Gaza, and will also limit offshore fishing to half the previous maritime limit, in a bid to restore order. Food and medicinal supplies would, however, be allowed to pass through the crossing.

Palestinian snipers fired and threw a number of explosives at Israeli troops during protests along the border fence in southern Gaza Strip, killing an Israeli soldier with a bullet to the chest. In response the Israeli army retaliated with air attacks and tanks fire aimed at eight military Hamas posts east of Khan Yunis and near the southern Rafah, as result three Hamas military wing members were killed in the exchange of fire. Then Israeli Air Force expand its air strike raising the death toll to four. Following the strikes, three rockets fired into Israeli communities around Gaza, two projectiles intercepted by Iron Dome and another fell in open field. United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov tweeted "everyone in Gaza needs to step back from the brink. Not next week. Not tomorrow. Right NOW! Those who want to provoke Palestinians and Israelis into another war must not succeed." According to Hamas, there was a ceasefire agreed upon afterwards, but Israel did not comment.

Seven Palestinians were killed in violent protests along the border fence, in a continuation of the "March of Return" protests. According to the IDF, "The rioters are burning tires and are hurling rocks, explosive devices, firebombs and grenades at IDF troops and the security fence". The demonstrations were arranged by Hamas, with the aid of special units formed to expand the protests. Four Palestinians were shot dead after they crossed into Israeli territory and approached a sniper's post.
Casualties.
One Israeli soldier has been injured due to shrapnel from a grenade thrown by a Palestinian from inside Gaza and one Israeli soldier has been killed by Palestinian sniper fire near the fence.
The head of WHO's office in Gaza, Gerald Rockenschaub, described the casualties as overwhelming an already weak health care system: "the deteriorating humanitarian situation is extremely worrying. Hospitals in Gaza are overwhelmed with the influx of injured patients. With further escalations expected during the coming weeks, the increasing numbers of injured patients requiring urgent medical care is likely to devastate Gaza's already weakened health system, placing even more lives at risk." According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, 69 ambulances were partly damaged.
Doctors Without Borders released a statement on 14 May 2018 calling the Israeli response "inhuman and unacceptable" saying that the hospitals in Gaza were overwhelmed and in a chaotic situation comparable to the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict. It stated that "most of the wounded will be condemned to suffer lifelong injuries".
HRW observers stated, with regard to 30 March, "while some protesters near the border fence burned tires and threw rocks, [HRW] could find no evidence of any protester using firearms or any IDF claim of threatened firearm use at the demonstrations." The organization said there is evidence of Palestinians who did not pose any threat to Israeli guards being shot. B'Tselem said that "shooting unarmed demonstrators is illegal and the command that allows it is manifestly illegal."
On 29 April, with the death toll at 44, an Israeli officer stated that most of the deaths were unintentional, that the snipers aimed for the legs but sometimes missed, or the bullets ricocheted or the protesters suddenly bent over.
Characterization of the injuries caused by Israeli fire.
The Commissioner General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) stated that the ammunition used by Israel caused severe internal damage to internal organs, muscle tissue and bones. A Palestinian doctor interviewed by CNN stated that about a half of the wounded people would never walk normally again. The head of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Shifa Hospital in Gaza wrote a letter to "The British Medical Journal" stating that "from the appearance of the wounds there appears to have been systematic use by [IDF] snipers of ammunition with an expanding 'butterfly' effect.", and stated that since the surgical procedures and rehabilitation facilities are not available in Gaza due to 2014 conflict and the blockade of Gaza, "mass lifelong disability is now the prospect facing Gazan citizens, largely young." The Israeli military stated that they only used normal sniper ammunition, and fired at the feet and legs to minimize civilian casualties.
According to Amnesty International, who interviewed military experts and a forensic pathologist, "many of the wounds observed by doctors in Gaza are consistent with those caused by high-velocity Israeli-manufactured Tavor rifles using 5.56mm military ammunition. Other wounds bear the hallmarks of US-manufactured M24 Remington sniper rifles shooting 7.62mm hunting ammunition, which expand and mushroom inside the body. The nature of these injuries shows that Israeli soldiers are using high-velocity military weapons designed to cause maximum harm to Palestinian protesters who do not pose an imminent threat to them."
Killing of medical personnel.
There have been several accusations of Israel attacking medical personnel. On 18 April, the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq accused Israel of shooting at civilians who were providing medical assistance to the wounded.
The Gaza-based human rights organization Al Mezan stated on 25 April that Israel had shot two paramedics working with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. It also stated that the situation has been compounded by Israel's refusal to allow personal safety equipment into Gaza including respirators.
A Canadian doctor, Tarek Loubani, was one of 19 medical personnel shot on 14 May. He stated that he was clearly marked, and believed that he was targeted by the Israeli military. One of the paramedics who treated Loubani was killed later on the same day. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was "appalled" at the shooting of Loubani and called for "an immediate independent investigation to thoroughly examine the facts on the ground – including any incitement, violence, and the excessive use of force".
In June 2018, Palestinian nurse Razan al-Najjar was fatally shot in the chest as she, reportedly with her arms raised to show she was unarmed, tried to help evacuate the wounded near Israel's border fence with Gaza.
Other notable casualties.
An eight-month-old child, Leila al-Ghandour was widely reported, following an initial statement by the Gaza Health ministry, to have been a victim of tear-gas at the border. The following day, the Gaza Health Ministry announced that it was not certain of the cause of death and two weeks later struck her name off the official list of people killed during the protests. In a court case against a Fatah al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades militant, who had been captured on the border, the indictment stated that man in question was a relative of the deceased's parents, and had stated the latter had been paid by Yahya Sinwar, the head of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades in Gaza, about US$2,200 to report to the media that she had died of tear gas inhalation rather than from a pre-existing medical condition.
Prevalence of militants among the killed.
Israeli defense sources claimed that a large fraction of those killed were members or otherwise affiliated with Palestinian militant organizations. According to Israel, the demonstrations provided cover for attacks by militants.
On 11 April, the military-affiliated Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (ITIC) published a report in which it stated that 26 of the 32 persons killed belonged to or were affiliated with Palestinian militant groups. The report identified thirteen of these as belonging to the military wings of these organizations, and six as members of the Gaza security forces.
On 14 May, when 59 to 62 Palestinians were killed, Hamas claimed 50 of them and Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed three as members of its military wing.
On 8 June, ITIC stated that it had identified 124 of the 127 Gazans reportedly killed in demonstrations since March. It reported that 102 of the killed were affiliated with either the militant or civilian wings of Fatah, Hamas, PIJ, the DFLP, or the PFLP.
Legal cases.
Two Palestinians, Yousef Karnaz and Mohammad Al-Ajouri, each had to have one of their legs amputated after Israeli authorities denied their requests to receive medical treatment at a better-equipped hospital in the West Bank. Israeli authorities issued a statement claiming that "The main consideration for the refusal stems from the fact that their medical condition is a function of their participation in the disturbances."
The Israeli Arab minority rights organization Adalah and Al Mezan petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to grant an emergency hearing to consider the request on 12 April, but as the Court decided to give the Israeli government three days to respond and due to this delay, doctors were forced to amputate their legs.
On 15 April, four Israeli human rights organizations, Yesh Din, Gisha, HaMoked, and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel jointly petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to revoke the rules of engagement used by the IDF in response to the protests. They argued that "there is no prohibition on demonstrating in Gaza and that if incidents of violence or attempts to cross the fence occur during demonstrations, they alone constitute civil disturbances of the peace. In such disturbances, the law permits live fire only in cases of immediate mortal danger." In response, the Israeli government refused to disclose its rules of engagement publicly, but said they "comply with Israeli law and with international law." The government indicated that it views the protests as "part of the armed conflict between the Hamas terror organization and Israel, with all that this implies." On 24 May 2018, the Supreme Court rejected the petition, ruling that the protests were not unarmed protests but a part of an armed conflict which were used as a cover to carry out terror attacks against Israel and risk Israeli lives.
On 16 April, the Supreme Court ruled that Karnaz must be allowed to exit Gaza to receive medical treatment in the West Bank to save his remaining leg.
Investigations.
On 5 April 2018, the IDF announced that its Southern Command would conduct an internal investigation into the deaths of civilians during the prior week. Brigadier General Moti Baruch was appointed to lead a second government investigation. Press reports indicate that Baruch's investigation will focus on incidents which appear to have a cause for inquiry.
On 18 March 2019, a three-person United Nations commission urged Israeli authorities to "step up" their investigations into Israeli troops shootings of Palestinian demonstrators during the protests. The U.N. investigators believe that the shootings "may have constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity." The commission of inquiry presented the United Nations Human Rights Council a full 252-page report.
Tactics.
Palestinian tactics.
Observers from the International Rescue Committee and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that the majority of protesters acted nonviolently on 30 March and 6 April.
On both of the larger protest days, hundreds of primarily young men approached or entered the 300-metre "exclusion zone" declared by Israeli military forces, thrown stones, hurled Molotov cocktails, and attempted to plant Palestinian flags. A "The New York Times" account described the purpose of approaching the fence as "a powerful statement of defiance, bravery and national pride" among Palestinians.
The Israeli military accused Hamas of using the protests as a guise to launch attacks against Israel, and warned about further reprisals. Israeli sources said that Hamas was forcing bus companies to transport people to the border for 6 April protests.
Israeli politicians repeated their accusations that Hamas utilizes protesters as human shields. The United States' Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt stated, with regards to the planned 6 April protest, that "[they] condemn leaders and protestors who call for violence or who send protestors – including children – to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed".
Senior Hamas official Mahmoud al-Zahar admitted in an interview to Al Jazeera "when we talk about 'peaceful resistance' we are deceiving the public. This is a peaceful resistance bolstered by a military force and by security agencies, and enjoying tremendous popular support."
Tent encampment.
Organizers set up five tents from the border and during the campaign their number grew to several dozen. Each tent was labeled with the town or village from which its occupants were expelled. The encampment allowed protesters to sleep, eat, and live on the site which hosted religious gatherings, weddings, and often had a festive atmosphere. Protests near the camps were large, diverse in participation, and peaceful. Many engaged in sit-in protests organized around their tents.
Earthen embankments were erected near the mark to try to shield those further away from Israeli sniper fire.
Tire burning.
Palestinians frequently burned tires and t-shirts which produced thick smoke and obstructed the sightlines of Israeli snipers. Often young men would roll burning tires towards the fence to create smokescreens.
Mask usage.
Palestinian protesters wore masks to protect themselves both from tear gas inhalation and to obscure their faces as it was speculated that the Israeli military was identifying and targeting known militants.
Incendiary kites and balloons.
In April 2018, Palestinians begun launching homemade incendiary kites and balloons. They would drift over the border and set fire to Israeli crop fields and forests.
As of early June, roughly 5,000 dunams of Israeli crop fields had been burned by kites launched from Gaza, with an estimated economic loss of US$1.4 million, in addition to 2,100 dunams of Jewish National Fund forests in the area and 4,000 to 5,000 dunams in the Besor Forest Nature Reserve. "The New York Times" reported one of its journalists sighting "vast stretches of scorched earth," with "losses to Israeli agriculture from flaming kites [being] immense."
Compensation for casualties.
Hamas said on 5 April 2018 that it would offer compensation for people injured or killed by Israeli soldiers while participating in the demonstrations. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasem stated that families to those killed would receive $3,000 and families to severely injured $500. Lightly injured persons would receive $200.
Israeli tactics.
The Israeli military deployed soldiers, including snipers and tanks, to the border. Soldiers opened fire on Palestinians approaching the fence with tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition. Soldiers fired from artificial sand berms that overlooked the protests. Israeli tear gas canisters penetrated more than into the Gaza Strip. An investigation by B'Tselem found that Israeli soldiers launched tear gas to the family tents, located from the fence, causing hundreds of people to suffer injuries. Protest participants interviewed by B'Tselem reported cases of suffering from tear gas inhalation and injury from tear gas canister impacts.
While the IDF has not publicly disclosed its rules of engagement, press reports indicate that soldiers are permitted to shoot armed Palestinians within of the fence and unarmed Palestinians within . The IDF has stated that its soldiers are advised to first fire warning shots, then wounding shots, before taking fatal shots. On 6 April, the IDF used industrial-sized fans to disperse the smoke and then water cannons in unsuccessful attempts to douse fires from burning tires.
Worldwide protests.
Demonstrations expressing solidarity with the protesters and condemning the use of lethal force by Israeli forces, were held in Israel, the US, the UK, and Australia. Thousands of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv, Washington D.C., Boston, London, Manchester, Sheffield, Bristol, and Melbourne.
Along with 250 others at a Tel Aviv protest, Michael Sfard, a human rights lawyer and political activist, said: "As an Israeli, my duty is to protest against the evils that are done in my name." On 31 March, 150 Israelis gathered in Yad Mordechai near the Israel-Gaza border to protest the IDF's use of deadly force, holding banners reading "Free Gaza," "Stop the Massacre", and "Gaza is Dying". On 2 April, 300 Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv outside Likud's party headquarters to protest, and a small group of Arab Israelis protested in Jaffa as well. There was a minor counter-protest, where people chanted "Israel belongs to Jews".
In Boston, Massachusetts, eight protesters, who chained themselves to the exterior door of the Israeli Consulate, were arrested by police for disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, and trespassing. Naturei Karta anti-Zionist protesters joined some thousands in London, UK, to show solidarity with Palestinians.
Reactions.
States.
The escalation of violence in Gaza concerned the entire Arab world. Jordan and Egypt condemned Israel's use of force, considering recent developments as harmful to brokering peace. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu exchanged heated remarks over the border clashes; Erdoğan labeled the Israeli response an "inhumane attack" amid growing international criticism of the Israeli military. Erdoğan accused Israel of committing a "genocide", calling Israel a "terrorist state". In response to anti-Israeli comments and actions by Erdoğan, the Knesset discussed the possibility of recognizing the Armenian genocide.
Australia and United States voiced support for Israel's right to defend itself. Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Morocco, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, and Vatican have criticized the actions of Israel or both sides of the conflict.
On 15 May, British Prime Minister Theresa May said, speaking alongside Turkish President Erdoğan, that "There is an urgent need to establish the facts of what happened yesterday through an independent and transparent investigation, including why such a volume of live fire was used and what role Hamas played in events." U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said that "Anyone who truly cares about children in Gaza should insist that Hamas immediately stop using children as cannon fodder in its conflict with Israel."
NGOs.
Amnesty International: On 27 April, the organization called for worldwide arms embargo on Israel for its "disproportionate response" to the protests.
The Israeli law center Shurat HaDin filed a complaint in the International Criminal Court against Hamas leaders Khaled Mashal, Saleh al-Arouri, and Zahar Jabarin for the use of children as human shields in the conflict along the border based on a clause in the Rome Statute that prohibits recruitment of children under the age of 15 to a militant organization. According to Shurat Hadin Director Nitzana Darshan-Leitner "The death of a 15-year-old boy near the Gaza border last week was a direct result of the war crimes committed by Hamas leaders against their own people".
Individuals.
On 8 April, Defense Minister of Israel Avigdor Lieberman said: "You have to understand, there are no innocent people in the Gaza Strip. Everyone has a connection to Hamas. Everyone receives a salary from Hamas. Those who are trying to challenge us at the border and breach it belong to Hamas' military wing."
On 15 May, Israel's ambassador to the UK, Mark Regev, said Israel "did everything we could" to avoid the bloodshed at the border with Gaza. He told BBC Radio 4's "Today programme": "We use live fire only in a very measured way, in a very surgical way and only when there is no alternative."
Retired British Colonel Richard Kemp said it was not a peaceful demonstration, but "a deliberate and specific intent by terrorist organizations to penetrate the State of Israel and kill civilians and the IDF has no option except to use lethal force to stop such a dangerous threat."
The legal scholar, English and European Court of Human Rights judge Sir Stephen Sedley opined that the use of live fire against unarmed protesters was "without much question a major crime".
The Israeli Prime Minister's Arabic-language spokesman Ofir Gendelman tweeted, in response to a video showing a flag with a swastika lying between two Palestinian flags, "Hamas terrorists have planted today right on the Gaza-Israel border this Nazi flag which was flying [between] Palestinian flags. Hamas proudly declares that its aim is to annihilate Israel &amp; the Jewish people. The genocidal message has been received. We will defend our country."
Israeli historian Zeev Sternhell wrote, "the weekly killing on the Gaza Strip border is a campaign of barbarism, exposing the mentality of the society in whose name the army acts: We can do anything we like."
Five former IDF snipers, assisted by Breaking the Silence, published a letter expressing "shame and sorrow" for the killings and stating, "instructing snipers to shoot to kill unarmed demonstrators who pose no danger to human life is another product of the occupation and military rule over millions of Palestinian people, as well as of our country's callous leadership, and derailed moral path."
American columnist Peter Beinart, reflecting on the succession of incidents marking the Land Day protests of 2018, wrote that Palestinians were rushing towards Israeli snipers because their land was fast becoming "uninhabitable", with the UN predicting it would be unliveable by 2020.
On 15 May, a group of nine prominent Israelis wrote a letter to "The Guardian" in which they compared the killings on the previous day to the Sharpeville massacre, and called for international intervention.
Senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Elliott Abrams said, "The leaders of Hamas view the citizens [of Gaza] as cannon fodder who are useful for the global media strategy, and from that point of view, Hamas leaders are happy when people die because they think it looks good on European TV screens."
Criticism of media coverage.
The area of the conflict is subject to intense monitoring. On the Israeli side of the border, IDF observers watch film and videotape events like the protests by availing themselves of telescopes, long lenses, and feeds from the cameras, drones, quadcopters and tethered surveillance balloons hovering over the sites. Israeli journalists were not permitted by the IDF to approach the area of conflict, but kept away. Almost from the outset, journalist Isabel Kershner observed that the March had given rise to a "war of words" between the involved parties.
Surveying the media reaction just after the events of 14 May, Haaretz noted that the events were covered extensively, with the violence in Gaza juxtaposed with the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem. The headlines focused on the death toll in Gaza and the pictures were split between Palestinian protesters wounded and killed, together with pictures of the opening ceremony in Jerusalem. South African media skipped the embassy opening and focused on the pictures from Gaza.
In the aftermath of the conflict, the way a number of mainstream newspaper outlets, including "The New York Times", covered the events has become the object of analysis, criticism and challenge. The political scientist Norman Finkelstein takes exception to what he perceives to be "The New York Times" portrayal of the March as one in which the protests were described as "armed confrontations in which Israeli snipers return the fire of protesters," notwithstanding the fact that human rights NGOs have stated the demonstrations were "overwhelmingly peaceful." In particular, he mentions articles by David Halbfinger, who was embedded among the Israeli snipers.""
An IDF spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, wrote for "The Wall Street Journal" that the world's media had fallen for what he said was "a well-funded terrorist propaganda operation" consisting of lies crafted to win "the international propaganda war." The protests were staged, the demonstrators paid actors, and Hamas orchestrated the violence to capture the headlines. "If," he concluded, "I need to lie like Hamas, then I prefer to tell the truth and lose." The IDF social media chief, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus thought that graphics from the Palestinian side of the border had allowed Hamas to win a PR battle "by a knockout," and attributed the result to an Israeli failure to minimize Palestinian casualties. Likewise, reacting to events just after the first March, retired brigadier-general Shlomo Brom declared: "I categorize what happened as a failure. The Palestinian aim was to raise international consciousness, and to put the Palestinian issue back on the international and Israeli agenda. It succeeded."
Veteran Israeli war correspondent Ron Ben-Yishai complained that Hamas had won the media battle partially because the IDF kept local journalists away from the border, thereby hindering Israeli journalists from documenting "the crowds of Gazans sent by Hamas to commit suicide on the fence." While massive video reportage was available on the Palestinian side of the fence, the IDF only provided the press with a "thin drizzle" of visual evidence, consisting of several dozen unclear images and short clips taken from its security camera coverage of the zone. Critics like Shehada, Stern-Weiner and Finkelstein wonder why, given its visual and video intelligence, the IDF did not buttress its claims over armed Hamas activity by providing footage.
On an 8 April, BBC News anchor Andrew Marr said "lots of Palestinian kids" were killed by Israeli forces. Jonathan Sacerdoti complained that the statement was misleading and false. BBC management ruled that Marr breached editorial guidelines, that the statement lacked any evidence and "risked misleading audiences on a material point".
On an 22 July, Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Emmanuel Nahshon, slammed CNN for "unbalanced coverage of recent events in Gaza" in its tweet "indicating killing of four Palestinians preceded deadly shooting of IDF soldier" and quoted Senator Ted Cruz, who criticized the BBC for "misrepresenting recent events in Gaza".

Vandorn Hinnant

Vandorn Hinnant (born 1953) is a visual artist, poet and educator based in Durham, North Carolina.
Early life and education.
Hinnant grew up in Old Asheboro neighborhood in Greensboro, North Carolina. Hinnant received a Bachelor of Art's degree from North Carolina A&amp;T University and attended at UNC Greensboro to study visual art. After college he moved to New York City and worked for the printmaker Josef Werner.
Career.
In 1988 Hinnant exhibited work based on the 13th century Fibonacci numbers and Lucas Pacioli's treatise. He began studying Sacred Geometry formally in 1989 with his mentor, inventor and physicist Robert L. Powell, Sr. In the 1980s Hinnant introduced fractal mathematics, the Golden Ratio, the Logarithmic Spiral, Sacred Geometery and most currently STEAM concepts into his work to explore metaphysical ideas. The ancient architectures in Egypt, India, Rome and Greece that use these concepts were his original influences, unpacking "pre-material template of energies," he said. Hinnant also has referenced Buckminster Fuller, Leonardo da Vinci, Frank Lloyd Wright and M.C. Escher as inspirations because of their use of geometry and math in making their artworks. Part of his objective is to catalyze dialogue through and around his work, connect these concepts to human relationships and encouraging education around the golden proportion.
In 1991 Hinnant was a founding member of the African American Atelier in Greensboro, of which he was a member of its first board. In 1999 he was a featured artist in Round 10 of Project Row Houses. His work was on display at Fayetteville Museum of Art in 1998 and 2006. In 2009 his work was in a two-person show with John Hiigli about math and structure. In 2011 Hinnant's work was included in an exhibition about mathematics through art at Antioch College. This exhibition also included work by Sol LeWitt, Karen Finley, DJ Spooky, Dread Scott, and John Sims.
In 2014 Hinnant's work was included in an exhibition about the golden ratio at the Saugerties Performing Arts Factory in New York. His work was also in an exhibition at The National Center for the Study of Civil Rights and African American Culture at Alabama State University. His work was included in the Museum of the Golden Ratio, a virtual museum of artworks. In 2015 there was a survey of Hinnant's work at North Carolina Central University Art Museum, the Winston-Salem State University and the Cameron Museum of Art in Wilmington, NC. In his exhibit at Winston-Salem State University's Diggs Gallery included a tribute installation called "Inquiries and Destinations: A Sound Room for Terry Adkins", inspired and dedicated by the late artist.
In 2016 over forty of Hinnant's works, spanning 35 years, were featured at the Rosenthal Gallery at Fayetteville State University. His work was also included in an exhibition called African American Abstraction at City Gallery East in Atlanta that same year.
In 2017 Hinnant created two-story public sculpture, called "Monument to Leadership", for Fayetteville State University's 150 year anniversary. The piece represented the pioneering vision of the school.
He was commissioned in 2018 by the city of Greensboro to design an artwork on the Bragg Street Downtown Greenway.
Hinnant's work is in public collections at the Atlanta International Airport, Wachovia Bank, Capital Broadcasting Company in Raleigh, NationsBank in Charlotte, Miller Brewing Company, Duke University Medical Center, Phizer Pharmaceuticals, Brandywine Workshop Collection and the Cumberland County Public Library among others. His work is also featured at the Piedmont Triad International Airport. Hinnant was a 1994 recipient of the North Carolina Artist Fellowship.
Mandalas.
Many of Hinnant's works explore mandalas, a visual spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. He uses circles, lines, angles, polyhedrons and color and tint to explore mandalas in his drawings, paintings and sculpture which are often installed together.
"Together We Rise".
Hinnant's city-commissioned eleven-foot sculpture called "Together We Rise" was installed in Corpening Plaza, Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 2014. He used geometry as a metaphor for the collaboration and harmony of the two different cities. The piece is stacked isosceles triangles made of stainless steel and commemorates the 100th anniversary of the two communities of Winston and Salem uniting in 1913. The surfaces of the triangles include text and images such as quotes by Maya Angelou and Margaret Mead and women activists who supported racial equality during the late 1800s, that helped to unpack its conceptual themes.
A Monument to Dignity and Respect.
In 2019 Hinnant was commissioned by the group Action Greenway to create a public artwork for the section of the greenway located alongside the Ole Asheboro neighborhood in Greensboro, North Carolina—the neighborhood Hinnant grew up in. Hinnant used inspiration from neighborhood meetings concerning the project to create the piece for the greenway titled, "A Monument to Dignity and Respect." This monument consists of two separate structures, a block apart, that work in dialogue with one another. Both structures sit on a metal trapezoid which has a plaque with three different quotes on it. The quotes on each plaque are from three different members of the Ole Asheboro neighborhood who were considered large forces in the neighborhood. On top of each trapezoid is a metal hand and arm that point to the sky. On one arm reads, "Dignity, united we stand". On the other arm reads, "Respect, together we rise". These structures were completed and installed in 2020.
The monument is meant to accomplish the following things—represent the Ole Asheboro community, pay tribute to the freedom fighters of African descent in North America as well as the pioneers of the civil rights movement, and work to encourage the continued global cause for human rights.

Swedish Professional Football Leagues

Swedish Professional Football Leagues (, the Swedish Elite Football Association, SEF) is a Swedish interest organisation that represents the 32 elite football clubs in the top two divisions (Allsvenskan and Superettan) of the Swedish football league system. SEF does not administer the divisions but acts in cooperation with the Swedish Football Association, the member clubs, sponsors and partners. The goal is to develop Swedish elite football resultwise, economically, commercially and administratively.
History.
Swedish Professional Football Leagues was founded in 1928 (under the name "Föreningen Svenska Serien Division 1") as a counterpart to the Swedish Football Association, with which top division clubs did not have a well-functioning relationship at that time. The organisation was initially only for clubs playing in the top division Allsvenskan, but in 1939 it was changed so that former top division clubs relegated to Division 2 could remain members. The current name of the organisation was adopted in 1972, and the membership at the time included 14 Allsvenskan clubs, 28 clubs playing in Division 2 and an additional five clubs playing in the third division, Division 3. From 1986 on, it was decided to only give membership to clubs either playing in the top division or the second division (then called Division 1, which became Superettan in 2000).

Absalom Scales House

The Absalom Scales House is a historic house in Eagleville, Tennessee, U.S..
History.
The house was built circa 1790 for Absalom Scales, a settler from North Carolina, and his wife Nancy Dalton, whose paternal grandfather, Samuel Dalton Sr., was a British immigrant and personal friend of U.S. President James Madison. In 1835, it was inherited by their son Noah, who lived here with his wife, Mary Batie Sayers, and their four children.
During the American Civil War of 1861–1865, Noah's daughter Mary stayed in the house with her husband, John Knox Womack, who was a Free Will Baptist preacher whose uncle was Confederate General A. P. Hill. At the same time, Womack joined the Confederate States Army and served under General Nathan Bedford Forrest. After the war, Womack resumed his ministry. After his wife died, he married her sister Charlotte, with whom he had six children. The house was later inherited by his daughter Nancy and her husband, Joseph A. Johnston.
Architectural significance.
The house was designed in the Classical Revival architectural style, and it was later remodelled in the Greek Revival style. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 30, 1973.

June Sauer (born 1924 or 1927) is a Canadian fashion photographer who specialized in photographing fur.
She was born in Thunder Bay (Port Arthur or Fort William at the time) and moved to Montreal in the late 1940s. There she married photographer Max Sauer. She learned photography from him and took over his studio after his death in 1954. Her clients included the Ogilvy department store, Holt Renfrew, the Fur Traders Association, Valentino and Chanel. She also photographed the cast of the satirical play "My Fur Lady" for McGill University.A book called From beaver to Bridget Bardot,by author Mrs. Nadeau acclaimed her attributes with a chapter entitled Through the Eyes of June Sauer
 In 1966, Ogilvy presented a retrospective of her work.
Her photographs capture the interaction and the contrast in textures between the white female model's skin and the fur garment. Sauer worked closely with her models and, as a woman, she felt that the models interacted with her differently than they would have with a male photographer.
In 1965, with Florence King Blackwell, she produced a fur fashion and tourist report for "Montreal" magazine called "The Beauties of Montreal".
In 1969, Sauer received the Craftsman of Photographic Arts award from the Professional Photographers of Canada. She also received a Merit Award from the Professional Photographers of America.

Aristaeomorpha foliacea

Aristaeomorpha foliacea, the giant red shrimp or giant gamba prawn, is a species of deep water benthopelagic decapod crustacean. It is found in all the world's oceans in the temperate and tropical zones. It is subject to some commercial fishing activity in the Mediterranean Sea.
Description.
"Aristaeomorpha foliacea" is a large decapod crustacean, a shrimp or prawn which has a firm and, flexible and light red exoskeleton and black eyes. In mature females black colour of the black ovaries darkens the dorsal part of the abdomen. There is a slight keel along the dorsal midlines of the third segment which becomes more probounced on the next three segments, ending in a sharp posterior point. It has long pleopods, antennal, hepatic and branchiostegal spines on its carapace, a very short upper antennal flagella, strong spines to the rear of the midpoint on the third to sixth abdominal segments, a telson with four small mobile lateral spines, the females have an open telicum and the species shows secondary sexual dimorphism in body size and the length of the rostrum with the adult females being larger and having a longer rostrum, extending well beyond the antennal scale. In the males the rostrum is short and does not reach the tip of the antenna's peduncle. There are 6-12 upper teeth on the rostrum, including 2 on the carapace. The largest females have a total length of and the largest males grow to . The more common measurements for females are body length and for males .
Distribution.
"Aristaeomorpha foliacea" is found in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic, the western Atlantic and the Indian Ocean into the Western Pacific from Japan to Australia and New Zealand as far east as Fiji. This distribution reflects the origin of "A. foliacea" in the Tethys Ocean during the Mesozoic, which covered an area approximately covering the present Caribbean Sea to the Indian Ocean and included areas which are now in the Mediterranean. Its expansion into adjacent areas of the Pacific is a later increase in distribution. The distribution of this species in the Mediterranean is rather patchy and the largest concentrations are in the central and eastern basins.
Habitat and biology.
The giant red shrimp is a deep-water. benthopelagic species and has a reported depth distribution of 120–1300 m, generally on muddy bottoms, in the Mediterranean it shows a preference for quite deep waters, mainly 500-800m, but it is more likely than related species to be found in shallower waters. It is known to gather in large aggregations in submarine canyons and trenches along the continental slope.
Only a few individuals reproduce in their first year. The development of the gonads starts during the winter and the shrimps reach sexual maturity in their second summer. Sexually mature males have an extended reproductive capacity and are able to mate throughout the year, however the females mature seasonally. In the Strait of Sicily the females maturate and spawn from spring until autumn, with a peak in summer-autumn. This species gathers in shoals when mating and spawning. The eggs are released into the sea but the larval and juvenile stages are little known.
This species is an opportunistic carnivore and scavenger with a high diversity in consumed prey types, the analysis of stomach content found both strictly benthic and pelagic prey . It is likely that this species undertakes diel migrations which are related to its feeding behaviour, during the day its prey consists of benthos while during the night it prets on animals higher in the water column. Recorded prey include crustaceans, bony fish, cephalopods siphonophores, gastropods, bivalves, polychaetes and foraminiferans. In the Straits of Sicily the main crustacean prey are "Plesionika" and "Pasiphaea" spp., especially "Pasiphaea sivado". Also in the Straits of Sicily cephalopods are relatively more important in its diet when compared to giant red shrimp from other areas, making "A. foliacea" a significant contributor to the juvenile mortality of species such as "Heteroteuthis dispar" in the food webs of the central Mediterranean. Giant red shrimp also change their feeding behaviour seasonally, siphonophores of the family Diphyidae are important in the spring while benthic gastropods are an important food source in autumn. There appears to be a correlation between increased feeding in the Spring and increased reproductive activity. In the winter this species seems to eat more food but the food is of lower quality.
Fisheries.
"Aristaeomorpha foliacea" is an important target species for bottom otter trawlers operating on the continental slope in the Strait of Sicily where is pursued by boats from Tunisia, Malta and Sicily. it is also a quarry species off Venezuela and Madagascar. "A. foliacea" is marketed fresh or frozen.

He was born in Amman, Jordan to a family of refugees who had fled from their village home near Hebron, Palestine during the 1948 Palestinian exodus. He arrived in Malta in 1990 as a science student. He studied biomedical sciences at Bristol University, and went on to obtain a master's degree in human rights from the University of Malta.
Nabhan has published two books of short stories in Maltese, and one novel titled "L-Eżodu taċ-Ċikonji" (2013) which won the Maltese National Prize for Literature in 2014, and the EU Prize for Literature in 2017. He published a collection of poetry in Maltese in 2014. Nabhan has also translated works of Maltese literature into Arabic.
On 24 January Walid Nabhan has stated that the prayers being organized by the Malta Muslim Council, led by Bader Zina, are a form of Islamic fundamentalism. He said that the building of another mosque is unnecessarily and that this would officiate the "split" between the Muslim community of the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque and the Muslim community of the Malta Muslim Council. He also discredited the need of other Muslim places of worship. He further observed that Bader Zeina himself, on "Times Talk" television program (on TVM (Malta)), has gone as far as silencing a Maltese woman (who converted to Islam) namely Simone Zammit Endrich who spoke of Islamic facts (religious practice and norms) rather than political Islam.
Walid Nabham is an integral well established writer in Malta and has written several literature material, including books about Islam and Arab culture, and has taken stands several times against religious fundamentalism. Following Nabham's remarks both him and Mr Zeina were invited on "Disett", a talkshow on TVM; were Zeina did not turn up, and when Nabham went back to his car after the talkshow he found his car vandalized which was interpreted as a form of a threat or warning.

2018 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals

The 2018 Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) Commissioner's Cup Finals was the best-of-7 championship series of the 2018 PBA Commissioner's Cup and the conclusion of the conference's playoffs. The Barangay Ginebra San Miguel and the San Miguel Beermen competed for the 18th Commissioner's Cup championship and the 123rd overall championship contested by the league.
This was the sixth Finals match-up between the two teams, with the Beermen winning four of the first five series. They last met during the 2016–17 Philippine Cup Finals which the Beermen won, 4–1. Barangay Ginebra's sole series win came during the 2007 Philippine Cup Finals.
The series highlighted the match-up between Greg Slaughter and 4-time MVP June Mar Fajardo, arguably two of the best centers in recent PBA history, who last faced each other in a finals series during their college days in CESAFI in 2009, which Slaughter's University of Visayas won. The series also featured the match-up between the PBA Best Import of the Conference award front-runners Justin Brownlee and Renaldo Balkman, who won a title as teammates with the San Miguel Alab Pilipinas of the ABL three months back.
Background.
Barangay Ginebra San Miguel.
This was Barangay Ginebra's fourth Commissioner's Cup Finals and 25th overall. They last appeared in a Comm's Cup Finals in 2013, with their last Commissioner's Cup title coming in 1997.
San Miguel Beermen.
This was the Beermen's 40th Finals appearance, who won all of their six previous Finals in the last ten conferences. This was their sixth Commissioner's Cup Finals appearance, and was the defending champion entering the series having won the previous year's series.
Game summaries.
Game 1.
Entering the game, Barangay Ginebra won 10 of their last 11 games and had the momentum to start strong in the series. They got into a fast start, leading by 15 in the first quarter and 19 after the half. Import Justin Brownlee was red-hot, having scored 29 points at halftime, with 18 coming in the first period. The Beemen tried to stage a comeback in the second half and was trailing by 19 after three quarters. However, Barangay Ginebra started the last period with a 25–5 run for a 39-point advantage, 119–80, the largest of the game. They never looked backed and dealt the Beermen their worst loss of the conference. Chris Ross tweaked his ankle in the fourth quarter and had to head to the locker room. After the game, he confirmed that he will be able to play in Game 2.
Brownlee led the Gin Kings with 42 points, 7 rebounds and 9 assists on 17-for-19 shooting and had support from the locals, with 4 other players scoring in double figures led by Joe Devance who had 22 points. For the Beermen, import Renaldo Balkman scored 27 points and top rookie Christian Standhardinger added 26, with four-time MVP June Mar Fajardo registering a double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds.
Ginebra shot 62 percent from the field and shot 13-for-25 from the arc. San Miguel only shot 39% and was 7-for-29 from 3. Ginebra also registered 37 assists. During the third quarter, Devance scored his 500th 3-point field goal made. He was the 41st PBA player and 19th among active players to reach that milestone.

2015–16 KK Crvena zvezda season

The 2015–16 season was the 71st season in the existence of the club. The team played in the Basketball League of Serbia, in the Adriatic League and in the Euroleague.
Overview.
The team started preparing for season 2015–16 by re-signing coach Dejan Radonjić and guard Branko Lazić for two years each. Team captain Luka Mitrović extended his contract until summer 2017. Marcus Williams, Boban Marjanović, Nikola Kalinić, Charles Jenkins and Jaka Blažič left the club, and roster was reinforced by Sofoklis Schortsanitis, Stefan Nastić, Ryan Thompson and Gal Mekel. From its development team FMP, Zvezda promoted MVP of 2015 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship, Marko Gudurić. The first part of the season was marked by mixed results and a lot of squad changes. Due to serious injuries of Mitrović and Dangubić, club brought back Marko Simonović, and later on landed Quincy Miller. Out-of-form Schortsanitis and Mekel were replaced by Vladimir Štimac and returning Marcus Williams. Mid-season, the club also released Williams and Thompson, replacing them with Vasilije Micić and Tarence Kinsey. Results improved, and Red Star ended group stage of EuroLeague with a 5–5 score, reaching the third place of group A, qualifying for Top 16 stage. Successful European season continued as Zvezda ended fourth in Top 16 Group E, with a score of 7 wins and seven losses.

The Dampf-Bahn-Club Sprockhövel operates since 2004 passenger transport on their ridable miniature railway with 127 mm (5 inches) and 184 mm (7¼ inches) gauge in Sprockhövel-Haßlinghausen in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany.
Location.
The rail track is located in the immediate vicinity of the former railway line Schee-Silschede, which is now used as a bicycle trail and is part of the Von-Ruhr-zur-Ruhr-Radweg.
Route.
The route, which runs in two partly winding circles over an area of about one hectare, is about long. The tracks are laid on a concrete foundation with a camber in the bends.
This is a complex construction, which is rare in garden railways, as the tracks are usually laid as in the raw-model in a ballast bed. With financial support from a local foundation, the association succeeded in 2017 to build a steel bridge, which is also used as a track underpass.
The club regularly organizes public driving days between April and September, which attracts mainly local families for leisure activities.
Rolling stock.
Most of the locomotive models are privately owned. These are driven by real steam or by electric motors that obtain their energy from accumulators . 
The scales of the vehicles vary between 1: 8 and 1: 3. Some locomotives were built in-house.

Harrison's rule

Harrison's rule is an observation in evolutionary biology by Launcelot Harrison which states that in comparisons across closely related species, host and parasite body sizes tend to covary positively.
Parasite species' body size increases with host species' body size.
Launcelot Harrison, an Australian authority in zoology and parasitology, published a study in 1915 concluding that host and parasite body sizes tend to covary positively, a covariation later dubbed as 'Harrison's rule'. Harrison himself originally proposed it to interpret the variability of congeneric louse species. However, subsequent authors verified it for a wide variety of parasitic organisms including nematodes, rhizocephalan barnacles, fleas, lice, ticks, parasitic flies and mites, as well as herbivorous insects associated with specific host plants.
The variability of parasite species' body size increases with host species' body size.
Robert Poulin observed that in comparisons across species, the variability of parasite body size also increases with host body size. 
It is self-evident that we expect greater variation coming together with greater mean body sizes due to an allometric power law scaling effect. However, Poulin referred to parasites' increasing body size variability due to biological reasons, thus we expect an increase greater than that caused by a scaling effect.
Recently, Harnos et al. applied phylogenetically controlled statistical methods to test Harrison's rule and Poulin's s Increasing Variance Hypothesis in avian lice. Their results indicate that the three major families of avian lice (Ricinidae, Menoponidae, Philopteridae) follow Harrison's rule, and two of them (Menoponidae, Philopteridae) also follow Poulin's supplement to it.
Implications.
The allometry between host and parasite body sizes constitutes an evident aspect of host–parasite coevolution. The slope of this relationship is a taxon-specific character. Parasites' body size is known to covary positively with fecundity and thus it likely affects the virulence of parasitic infections as well.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), an unmanned aircraft (UA), commonly known as a drone, is operated without a pilot on board. An unmanned aircraft system (UAS) comprises the UA and associated elements such as the remote control equipment.
Due to Singapore's busy airspace and densely populated urban environment, the UA laws in Singapore are regressive. UAs must be operated safely and responsibly to avoid risks to aviation and public safety. The CAAS requires operators to understand and abide by regulations, including recreational or research uses of the UA. More information on the regulations can be found on Air Navigation Order, paragraph 80.
Regulations of Unmanned Aircraft.
Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Act.
The Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Act provides clear guidelines for the safe use of unmanned aircraft.
Laws were passed in Parliament on 11 May 2015 to allay concerns over safety, security and privacy surrounding unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), taking effect on 1 June the same year. The Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Act outlines regulations for the safe flying of drones and enforcement action against errant users. For instance, permits are required to fly drones above 7 kg, or within a 5 km radius of an aerodrome.
Before conducting any outdoor activities, operators should ensure that the UA is flown within the permitted areas. The CAAS website provides a map delineating prohibited areas, danger and restricted areas, areas within 5 km of an airport or an airbase and protected areas.
Public Order Act.
In 2017, the Singapore National Day Parade was gazetted as a “special event” under the Public Order Act. The order, which was in effect for 24 hours on 9 August 2017, prohibited the unauthorised flying of unmanned aerial vehicles (AUV) such as drones in the area without a permit. The boundaries of the special event area included Marina Boulevard, Victoria Street, Middle Road, Beach Road and the Marina Barrage carpark.
It is also an offence to fly a UAV outside of the special event area in a manner that “disrupts, interferes with, delays or obstructs” with the National Day Parade. Offenders may be arrested and upon conviction, be liable to an imprisonment term for up to 12 months, a fine of up to $20,000, or to both. The UAV will be seized.
The 32nd Asean summit held at the Istana on 27 April 2018 and the Shangri-La Hotel on 28 April was declared an enhanced security special event under the Public Order Act by the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is an offence to bring or fly drones in the area or outside of the area that disrupts, interferes with, delays or obstructs the conduct of the event.
Personal Data Protection Act.
The Data Protection Provisions do not impose any obligation on an individual acting in his personal or domestic capacity. Organisations will need to consider whether the drones they deploy are likely to capture personal data of individuals, and may wish to evaluate whether any exception under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) applies in respect of its particular circumstances.
Organisations using UAs for photography, video or audio recording activities that capture personal data should refer to the Personal Data Protection Commission's (PDPC) advisory guidelines. Among other obligations, the Data Protection Provisions require organisations to
inform individuals of the purposes for which their personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in order to obtain their consent. An organisation must therefore provide notification of the purposes for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data captured by its drones, in order to fulfil the obligation to obtain consent. The notifications should specify if photography, video and/or audio recording is occurring and should generally be placed so as to enable individuals to have sufficient awareness that drones are in operation in the general locale. For example, it may be appropriate to place a notice at points of entry to the area of operation, where individuals are able to read the notice prior to entry.
Telecommunications Act.
Users with UAs that contain short range devices that conform to the approved operating radio frequencies and corresponding power limits will be exempted from Info-communications Media Development Authority's (IMDA) licensing requirements. For UAs with radio frequencies or power limits that are not in the IMDA's guidelines, equipment dealers have to apply for the relevant license and register their equipment with the IMDA. Under the Telecommunications (Dealers) Regulations, an equipment dealer may only sell IMDA-registered telecommunication equipment for use in Singapore.
Types of UA Usage.
In general, permits are not required for recreational or research uses of UA in Singapore, as long as the operation of the UA is in line with CAAS’ operating conditions.
Situations where recreational or research uses of UA require a permit is where:
Recreational Uses.
CAAS defines recreational activities as “any pursuit or activity engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure”.
Activities that are not considered recreational uses include:
Research Uses.
According to CAAS, any activity falling within the following categories are considered research in nature: 
Other Uses.
Regardless of UA weight or location of UA operations, an operator permit and Class 1 Activity Permit is required for operations that are non-recreational or non-research in nature.
Examples of applicable uses include:
UA Permits.
Operator Permit.
CAAS grants an operator permit to an applicant who is able to ensure safe operation of UA, taking into account the applicant's organisational set-up, competency of the personnel especially those flying the UA, procedures to manage safety including the conduct of safety risk assessments, and the airworthiness of each of the aircraft. The permit is valid for up to one year.
Activity Permit.
An activity permit is granted by CAAS to an applicant for a single activity or a block of repeated activities to be carried out by a UA at a specific area of operation, and which are of specific operational profiles and conditions.
A Class 1 Activity permit is required for purposes that are not recreational or research in nature; or if the UA used is over 7 kg in total mass (including payload). A Class 1 Activity Permit is not valid without a UA Operator Permit.
A Class 2 Activity permit is required for UA activities for recreational or research purposes, and which meets any of these conditions:
The table below summarises the various permit fees:
Other Permits.
Besides permits from the CAAS, other permits may be required from various agencies depending on the nature of the usage. This includes:
Issues Surrounding UAs.
Accidents involving UAs.
Before the Act was introduced in 2015, then Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said in Parliament that there had been more than 20 reported incidents involving drones between April 2014 and May 2015, two of which involved the drones falling onto MRT tracks.
In 2016, the Singapore government received a report of a remote control aeroplane that damaged the roof of a housing block in Bishan. However, the operator had yet to be located, according to Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan in a written parliamentary response.
Breaches of regulations.
In 2015, a 27-year-old man who flew a drone at the War Memorial Park on National Day was given a stern warning by the police. He was believed to have been trying to take photographs of the NDP fireworks.
Between June 2015 and May 2017, the CAAS recorded 103 violations. Mr Tan Kah Han, senior director for safety regulation and director for airworthiness and flight operations at the CAAS, said that such incidents typically involve flying within 5 km of aerodromes, which is not allowed, and flying within restricted and security-sensitive areas without a permit.
In 2017, there were 12 breaches involving UAs during the National Education and preview shows according to a police statement.
On 9 August 2017, a 53-year-old man was arrested on National Day for flying a drone at Marina Barrage, which was marked within the Special Events Area. Unauthorised flying of unmanned aerial vehicles is not allowed for 24 hours on National Day.
Opinions by industry players.
Experts highlight the risks of increasingly sophisticated drone technology being "accessible to the man on the street at brick-and-mortar shops or online", such as high-definition video capabilities making it easier for surveillance to be carried out covertly.
In 2015, The Workers' Party’s Gerald Giam, a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, proposed fitting drones above a certain weight and size with geo-fencing capabilities, to prevent them from entering prohibited spaces. Government Parliamentary Committee (Home Affairs and Law) member Desmond Choo felt that it was important to conduct education campaigns to educate both users and companies that bring in drones.
Dr Foong Shaohui, a Singapore University of Technology and Design assistant professor with an interest in robotics and unmanned systems, highlighted how without proper training, even a drone weighing just 1 kilograms can cause property damage and serious injuries.”
Mr Mohamed Faisal Mohamed Salleh, deputy director of Nanyang Technology University's Air Traffic Management Research Institute, said that it can be "almost impossible" to find the pilot after UA-related accidents. To counter this issue, he suggested the use of aircraft surveillance technology to trace the positions of all UAs, which could potentially involve the use of telco or wireless networks, or by creating an "Electronic Road Pricing system in the sky".
While Mr Yue Keng Mun, from Temasek Polytechnic's School of Engineering, proposed having indoor or fenced-up outdoor spaces for operators to practice their flying skills, Mr Khaw responded in his parliamentary reply that "promoting shared used of space in land-scarce Singapore was preferable to setting aside special flying parks."
According to an article by The Straits Times in January 2018, more private condominiums are banning the use of drones within their estates, citing concerns over privacy and safety.
Developments in UA regulations and initiatives.
In 2017, Singapore joined the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Advisory Group, a 15-member group set up by the United Nations’ civil aviation arm to draw up global rules and regulations for the safe use of UAs.
In 2018, one-north was designated as Singapore's first drone estate, to provide companies and research institutions with an urban environment for test-bedding innovative unmanned aircraft systems. Under the drone estate initiative, approved operators and research users can carry out their trials and operations at one-north without compromising safety and security.
The Singapore Armed Forces have invested in new technologies such as drones that can home in and catch errant drones. Counter-drone systems are among the features of smart airbases of the future.

Welcome Me Love

"Welcome Me Love" is a 1969 song by The Brooklyn Bridge. It was issued as the B-side of "Blessed Is the Rain," (Canada #48, U.S. #45) but became a double-sided hit.
As "Blessed Is the Rain" descended the charts, "Welcome Me Love", garnered enough airplay to become an equal-sized hit. It reached number 48 U.S. "Billboard" and number 47 on "Cash Box." In Canada, it definitively became the bigger hit, spending two weeks at number 38.
Internationally, "Welcome Me Love" was then re-issued as the A-side, still backed with "Blessed is the Rain."

Ehrwalder Sonnenspitze

The Sonnenspitze, also Ehrwalder Sonnenspitze, is a mountain, high, in the Mieming Chain in the Austrian state of Tyrol with a subpeak, the "Signalgipfel" (2,412 m) to the south. An ascent of the Sonnenspitze is one of the most popular tours of the Mieming Chain.
Location.
The Sonnenspitze lies south of the village of Ehrwald on the north-westernmost end of the Mieming Chain. To the west lies the village of Biberwier, to the east is the 1,657 m high lake of Seebensee. To the south over the col of "Biberwierer Scharte" (2,000 m) is the Wampeter Schrofen (2,520 m).
Ascents.
The summit may be ascended from the Coburger Hut (1,917 m) on an easy, but in places exposed climb (in places UIAA II) up its south side. The way is marked and secured with anchors and several pitons as intermediate belay points. In places the waymarks are hard to spot, which is why a good sense of direction for the ascent is essential. At the top there is another very narrow and very exposed summit ridge to cross in order to get to the summit cross. This absolutely requires a head for heights.
Another ascent runs from the Seebensee along the northeast ridge to the top. It can be used as a descent when crossing. It runs for long sections through steep, grassy slopes and the uppermost 100 metres in height are a UIAA grade II climb in places. This section too is well marked in places and protected with new belays.
Several climbing routes run along the south arête and up the west face.

Betül Kaçar

Betül Kacar is an Assistant Professor of Astrobiology at the University of Wisconsin. She directs a NASA Astrobiology Research Center exploring the essential attributes of life, its origins and how they should shape our notions of habitability and the search for life on other worlds.
Education and Career.
Kacar was born in Istanbul. She was the first woman in her family to receive formal education. She studied chemistry at Marmara University. She received Howard Hughes Medical Institute undergraduate fellowship to spend a summer conducting scientific research in Emory University studying organic chemistry. She returned to Emory University in 2004, and eventually earned a PhD in Biomolecular Chemistry in 2010 in enzyme structure-function relationship. Kacar transitioned to study origins of life after Ph.D. She was appointed as a NASA postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2010. She was awarded a NASA scholarship in 2011, followed by funding from the NASA Astrobiology Institute and Exobiology Branch in 2013. She joined Harvard University in 2014, where she led an independent research group as a fellow in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. In 2015, she received the Templeton Fellowship and became a member of the Harvard Origins Initiative. Kacar was named NASA Early Career Faculty Fellow in 2019. In 2020, she received the Scialog fellowship for her studies on life in the universe by the Research Corporation and Science Advancement.
Research.
Kacar's research encompasses the origins of life, early evolution, life in the universe and how the molecular mechanisms of evolution can be understood. She currently leads a NASA Astrobiology Center in molecular paleobiology to understand alien planets and ancient life. She is the first Turkish woman and the youngest scientist to lead a NASA research center. She was the first to resurrect an ancient gene inside a modern microbial genome. She coined the term paleophenotype, reconstructing and examining the evolutionary history of contemporary components and then tying their phenotypes into biosignatures to provide insight into innovations that are grounded in the rock record and thus in the geological and ecological context. In 2020, she proposed a possible application of prebiotic chemistry, protospermia, sending the chemical capacity for life to emerge on another planetary body. Her research team defined “evolutionary stalling” as an evolutionary mechanism to prevent a module from reaching its local performance peak and thereby imposes a genetic load, i.e., the organism carrying a stalled module suffers a fitness cost relative to an organism whose module performance is optimal. 
Kacar is a professor at the University of Wisconsin, in the Department of Bacteriology. She is also an associate professor at the Earth-Life Science Institute at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. She has been described as a "prominent member" of the NASA Astrobiology Institute. She has received over $9 million of grant funding as a lead investigator.
Community Work.
Kacar is the co-founded the only astrobiology outreach and grassroots network SAGANet that serves teachers and students in astrobiology research globally. In 2011 Kacar became a member of the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science. She was formerly part of the Global Science Coordinator for ELSI Origins Network aiming to increase early-career research scientist participation in the field of origins of life. She discussed finding alien life in SXSW in 2020. She partnered with the 2020 UN Women Generation Equality Campaign to support education of girls and women globally.

The Dancers of Arun

The Dancers of Arun is a fantasy novel by American writer Elizabeth A. Lynn, published in 1979.
Plot summary.
"The Dancers of Arun" is a novel that is the second part of The Chronicles of Tornor series.
Reception.
Greg Costikyan reviewed "The Dancers of Arun" in "Ares Magazine" #5 and commented that "The primary thrust of the novels is their Message: that we can live in harmony, that capitalism is not necessary since we can all share in love and wonderfulness, and that all problems can be solved if we have the courage to be human. Nice enough, but hardly earth-shattering."
"Kirkus Reviews" states "Lynn is to be admired for attempting serious things in the fantasy genre, but here nothing quite works: the settings remain faceless despite any amount of description; the love story awkwardly combines homosexual incest and drenching sentimentality; and Lynn's prose style is laconic to the point of numbness. A gifted writer, gone much astray."

Coburger Hut

The Coburger Hut () is an Alpine hut owned by the Coburg Branch of the German Alpine Club. It is located in the Mieming Range in the Austrian state of Tyrol and lies only a few metres in height above the lake of Drachensee. The accommodation is generally open from June to early October and there is a winter room.
History.
The construction of the hut goes back to a proposal by the Munich alpinist, Ferdinand Kilger, in 1890. This was taken up in 1895 by the Coburg branch of the German Alpine Club, a branch which had been founded in 1879. In 1901 the first hut was finished and, in the years that followed, it was given a water connexion (the "drinking quality water" was drawn from the Grünsteinsee, a lake which has now dried out), an electrical generator and, in 1908, a telephone line.
After the First World War the building was extended for the first time and, in 1962, the material ropeway was built. For the 75th anniversary of the hut a new toilet block was built. Other renovation and building measures followed in the 1980s, after the responsible district author in Imst declared the building as unsound and a fire risk. In the 1990s, electricity and water supplies and drainage and waste were brought up to new environmental standards.
In 2009–2011 the Coburger Hut was again extended and modernised; as well as general renovation work, a new heat and power station ("Blockheizkraftwerk") and a seminar room were installed.
Ascents.
The hut may be reached directly from the Austrian village of Ehrwald in various ways.
Hoher Gang.
To negotiate the Hoher Gang, which runs from Ehrwald to the Coburger Hut, sure-footedness and a head for heights are absolutely essential, which is why these variants are only suited for the experienced, especially as it is only protected by cable in some places. The route starts at a height of 1,100 m and runs – fringed by mountain pines – after a crossing of the Gaißbach stream to the lake of Seebensee. After that there are only 300 vertical metres to climb in tight zigzags in order to reach the hut (3 hours by foot).
Seeben Klettersteig.
The Seeben Klettersteig, which begins about ¾ hour from the valley station of the Ehrwalder Almbahn at the Seeben Waterfall, runs along the Gaißbach to the café ("Jausenstation") of Seebensee near the eponymous lake. This variant is also only suitable for experienced mountaineers (Klettersteig grade D+), it has cable protection in very exposed terrain. The whole journey takes 3 hours.
Ehrwalder Alm.
The simplest way to reach the hut is to climb up to the Ehrwalder Alm (1,502 m) from the village (1,000 m), using the Ehrwalder Almbahn (1,502 m) to assist in gaining height. There is then a small alm road which passes the Seebenalm and Seebensee in narrow zigzags to the Coburger Hut (2 hours from the Ehrwalder Alm).
Immensteig.
The Immensteig branches off the path to the Ehrwalder Alm 300 metres above the valley station of the Ehrwalder Almbahn.

Gema Ramkeesoon

Gema Ramkeesoon ("née" Julumsingh; 1910-1 March 1999) was a Trinidadian and Tobagonian social worker and women's rights activist who was one of the early pioneers of the women's movement in Trinidad and Tobago. She was honored for her social service work as a member of the Order of the British Empire in 1950 and received the gold Hummingbird Medal from Trinidad and Tobago in 1976.
Early life.
Gema Wellesley Julumsingh, a Dougla, was born in 1910 in Curepe, when Trinidad was part of the British West Indies to Florence (née Arindell) and Julumsingh, an educated man of Indian heritage. Her mother, of White Scottish and Afro-Caribbean heritage died when she was around two years old and her father sent Gema and her younger sister to live with her maiden aunt, Ada Arindell, in Newtown, Port of Spain. She attended a private elementary school, run by Miss Moore and took violin lessons. At age thirteen, she began attending Bishop Anstey High School, where she passed her Junior Cambridge Examination, earning a distinction in geography. She left school at fifteen and married at All Saints Church in Port of Spain the following year, with John Dyal Ramkeesoon, a priest at St Agnes Anglican Church in Saint James.
Career.
Influenced during her schooling by Beatrice Greig, a white activist, but one who spoke about the empowerment of Indo-Trinidadian women, Ramkeesoon became involved in the Cedros Bees, in 1926. The group was a mentoring program for young girls. After her marriage, as the wife of a clergyman, she was required to assist in parish activities. Joining the Mother's Union, she became the first local president of the organization. She joined the Coterie of Social Workers, founded by Audrey Jeffers and was one of the few woman of Indo-Trinidadian descent involved in the organization. Ramkeesoon worked to improve the relationship between Afro-Caribbean and Indo-Caribbean women, as both groups were often ignored by mainstream feminist groups. The group participated in campaigns for women’s right to education, public office, and divorce, but also provided community assistance to those in need, such as establishing homes for the blind and school feeding programs.
Ramkeesoon campaigned against discrimination based on skin color, a distinct prejudice from racism as it is based on biases against people of varying shades within their own racially identified communities, and in 1949 co-founded the Indo-Caribbean Cultural Council with Patrick Solomon, to find means for the two largest ethnic groups in the country to work together.
She participated in and led social work conferences internationally; such as the 1949 Social Welfare Conference held in Jamaica, the 1950 Anglican World Conclave in London, and the 1953 Bridgetown meeting of the Barbados Women's Alliance, which she chaired. Ramkeesoon was in favor of regional cooperation and was a proponent of the development of the Federation of Social Welfare Workers in 1950, proposed to unite women across the British West Indies in their projects to improve their communities. In 1956, she was one of the women considered for appointment to the Senate of the West Indies Federation.
Among her many contributions, Ramkeesoon served as chair of the Women's Prison Visiting Committee; was Executive Director of the YWCA; served as a president of the Women's Corona Society; was the secretary of St. Mary's Home in Tacarigua and of the Day Nursery Association; and served as secretary and treasurer of Bishops Centenary College of Port of Spain She was honored as a member of the Order of the British Empire in 1950 and was awarded the golden Hummingbird Medal from Trinidad and Tobago in 1976 for her social service work. In 1989 the Oral and Pictorial Records Programme of the University of the West Indies selected her as one of the pioneers of the women's movement to be interviewed. The five audio cassettes of the interview conducted by Maureen Cain are held in the Alma Jordan Library, on the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies.
Death and legacy.
Ramkeesoon died on 1 March 1999. In 2013, she was honored by the University of the West Indies at its 20th Anniversary Conference on Gender Transformations in the Caribbean as one of the pioneers of feminism and human rights activism in the region.

The Kitchen Maid (Chardin)

The Kitchen Maid is a 1738 painting by Jean Simeon Chardin. The painting features a young kitchen maid in a Hollandish kitchen, taking a break from her work. The work was popular, and Chardin had made four different copies; with three of them present in various collections in the modern day.
Background.
Chardin was born in Paris, the son of a cabinetmaker, and rarely left the city. Chardin entered into a marriage contract with Marguerite Saintard in 1723, whom he did not marry until 1731. According to one nineteenth-century writer, at a time when it was hard for unknown painters to come to the attention of the Royal Academy, he first found notice by displaying a painting at the "small Corpus Christi" on the Place Dauphine. Van Loo, passing by in 1720, bought it and later assisted the young painter.
Upon presentation of "The Ray" in 1728, he was admitted to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. The following year he ceded his position in the Académie de Saint-Luc. He made a modest living by "produc[ing] paintings in the various genres at whatever price his customers chose to pay him", and by such work as the restoration of the frescoes at the Galerie François I at Fontainebleau in 1731.
In November 1731 his son Jean-Pierre was baptized, and a daughter, Marguerite-Agnès, was baptized in 1733. In 1735 his wife Marguerite died, and within two years Marguerite-Agnès had died as well.
Subject and composition.
Chardin's pigments are granular, his palette earthy, and his handling is thick.The light of the painting has been described as subdued, with nothing being sudden or jarring. There is a superficial reference to Hollandish kitchens, and this is done only with respect to the props and predominantly brown coloring. The primary object of the painting is a young kitchen maid on a low chair, looking to the right of the viewer during what appears to be a pause from her task. The expression on the maid's face is one that is neither of sadness nor one of joy; picturing a woman that is focused on her work. The pictoral space is bounded, with a quality of contentment and timelessness. One the floor are assorted vegetables, some cooking pots, and a butcher's block. The block features a meat-cleaver with a spat of blood, bringing in the suggestion of violence to the purposed domestic reflection.
It is unknown whether or not Chardin had intended for there to be a message in the painting, or if at all in any of his paintings. Despite portraying a servant helping in domestic tasks——described to be of a low social scale——the woman was still dressed well. In addition, the kitchen is kept in neat order; a sharp contrast to the portrayals of domestic servants in other paintings of the time. Nevertheless, the maid is still not a model of industry either, as the viewer in intended to speculate on what the maid is speculating in her moment of pause. It has been mentioned by critics that there is a sensuous quality in Chardin's execution, in design, and in the choice of his colors. The techniques of ambiguity and sense has been noted to be a common trait for many of Chardin's works.
Exhibition.
Chardin first exhibited the painting along with five other works at the Salon of 1739 as La Ratisseuse de Navets (Woman scraping Turnips). When the painting was first submitted, it drew little attention from critics due to the success of his other painting: "The Governess". Chardin painted at least three versions of the painting. The existing works are the Washington copy, signed and dated to 1738; another in Munich, signed and dated to 1746; a copy given by Count Rudolf von Rothenburg for Frederick II of Prussia, lost since 1918; and the fourth copy in the Netherlands, believed to be a studio copy. The existence of four copies of the painting attests to the success of the painting with some copies, such as the Washington copy, being at some point acquired by royals such as the Prince of Liechtenstein.

Strathy Point Lighthouse is a remote lighthouse that is located on the north coast of Sutherland, Scotland, and is situated on the coast close to the village of Strathy. Strathy Point was the first lighthouse in Scotland specifically built to be electrically operated. It was initially planned in 1953 and was completed by 1958. The lighting device itself is a two panel device with a focal length of 250mm with a 250watt light bulb, that gives a range of almost 26 miles. The lighthouse was originally fitted with a fog horn, which is no longer used.
The Station was fully automated in 1997 and is now telemetered from the Northern Lighthouse Board Headquarters in Edinburgh.

The Dement House, also known as Colonial Acres, is a historic house in Lascassas, Tennessee, U.S.. It was first built as a log cabin by Abner Dement, the son of a French immigrant and slaveholder, in 1817. When Abner was murdered by one of his slaves in 1825, the cabin was inherited by his son John, who lived here with his wife Christine Overall. The couple hired Arch Hite to turn the cabin into a two-story house with a portico designed in the Greek Revival architectural style in 1833. The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 25, 1986.

Gaagudju

The Gaagudju, also known as the Kakadu, are an Aboriginal Australian people of the Northern Territory.
Name and language.
Gaagudju was a language spoken by a primary group known by that name, and a secondary group of contiguous peoples who used it as a second language, such as the Amurdak, Gundjeihmi, Giimiyu, Bininj and Umbugarla peoples. Many of the latter ceased to speak their mother tongue in preference for Gaagudju after the 1930s, and it became in turn their first language.
Country.
The Gaagudju were a people of the northern Kakadu area. Baldwin Spencer identified the area around Oenpelli as Gaagudju territory, for they happened to be the dominant group there at the time. In Norman Tindale's estimate, the Gaagudju possessed estates covering inland of the Van Diemen Gulf some between the eastern and southern Alligator Rivers, and running southwards as far as the mountain country. They were resident at both Cannon Hill and Mount Basedow.
Social organisation.
The Gaagudju were divided into 4 estate-owning clans, the Bunidj, the Djindibi (around Munmalarri), and two Mirarr clans.
History of contact.
The Cobourg cattle company took up a lease for hunting buffalo in the Alligator River area in 1876, and Aboriginal people were a major part of the workforce. The Gaagudju, with the arrival of the feral buffalo hunter Paddy Cahill in their area in the 1880s, were employed by him in tracking and harvesting kills of this introduced animal. For many decades they dominated the industry. There was a dramatic population collapse in that area for the next three decades (1880-1920) due to introduced diseases and new colonial land use.
Most of the material collected by Baldwin Spencer over two months on the people of Oenpelli reflects a Gaagudja perspective, since Spencer's main informant, Cahill, happened to be fluent in that language and was an intermediary between Spencer and the three Indigenous informants, Mitcheralaka (Madjirrilaaga) of the Mirarr clan, Kopereiki (Gabhirrigi) of the Bunidj clan, and Wardiirdi, also of the Bunidj, and Wudeirti. But at the same time Spencer realised that several other Aboriginal peoples were present at Oenpelli and that Cahill's Gaagudeju testimony covered their distinct traditions as well.
After Cahill's death the Gaahudju shifted to the Alice and Mary River areas, to continue buffalo hunting, and gradually Oenpelli was occupied by the Kunwiŋku who moved in from the west.

Twentytwo in Blue

Twentytwo in Blue is the second studio album by American indie rock band Sunflower Bean. It was released on March 23, 2018 under Lucky Number in the UK and Mom + Pop Music worldwide.
Release.
The first single "I Was A Fool" was released on November 3, 2017. Guitarist Nick Kivlen explained the song "seemingly crept up from nowhere and into our practice space. It was a special moment between the three of us, Julia and I both improvised the lyrics."
The second single "Crisis Fest" was released on January 12, 2018, along with the announcement of their second album.
On February 23, 2018, the third single "Twentytwo" was released.
The fourth single "Human For" was released on March 16, 2018.
Critical reception.
"Twentytwo in Blue" was met with "generally favorable" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 78, based on 20 reviews. Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 76 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 24 reviews.
Tim Sendra from AllMusic said the band "don't pull any punches and the record has an immediate impact, both sonically and emotionally. About half the record sounds like the work of a road-tested, whip-smart rock &amp; roll band," while noting the album fits "together perfectly; from the songs to the sounds to the performances, it's indie rock and pop at their thoughtful, searching, sweet, and punchy best." Alex McLevy from The A.V. Club said the album is "tighter in execution, broader in scope, and more pop-focused in nearly every way. Taken as a collection, it sounds like a jukebox full of lost ’70s hits." At Clash, Aurora Henni Krogh said "Sunflower Bean have found a maturity and a balance between lyrics and melody that infatuates. Though they sometimes still miss, 'Twentytwo In Blue' stakes out the loss of innocence that comes with growing up, and it does it beautifully."

Soviet Baltic Sea submarine campaign in 1941

The Soviet submarine Baltic Sea campaign in 1941 was launched by the Soviet Navy at the early stage of Operation Barbarossa. The offensive was hampered by the quick German ground advance and the retreat of Soviet naval vessels from the main Baltic harbors. 
Background.
At the beginning of the conflict the Soviet Navy operated a formidable force on paper, consisting of 75 submarines. However, only 35 submarines were operational: 15 of them were located in the Latvian port of Liepaja were ordered to retreat to Tallinn due to the rapid German ground advance, during this redeployment the submarine S-3 was intercepted and sunk in surface action by German S-boats. Another 5 submarines were scuttled in the harbor, including the two former Latvian Ronis-class submarines. At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German Navy at first operated only a relatively small force of vessels including five submarines; (U-140, U-142, U-144, U-145 and U-149); engaging the Soviet ones in anti-submarine hunts.
Engagements.
On 23 June, German submarine U-144 torpedoed and sunk Soviet submarine M-78 off Liepaja.
On 27 June, German submarine U-149 torpedoed and sunk Soviet submarine M-99 east of Dagö Island.
On 28 June, Soviet submarine S-10 was lost, most likely mined in the Irben Straits.
On 1 July, Soviet submarine M-81 was lost, mined off Vormsi, Estonia.
On 21 July, German submarine U-140 torpedoed and sunk Soviet submarine M-94.
On 2 August, Soviet submarine S-11 hit a mine and sank off Hiiumaa Island, Estonia. 3 crewmembers managed to survive, coming out from the wreck and swimming to surface (boat was at 11 metres of depth).
On 6 August, Soviet submarine S-6 went missing: wreck discovered in Swedish waters off Öland in 2012, loss due mine.
On 10 August, Soviet submarine ShCh-307 torpedoed and sunk German submarine U-144 west of Dagö.
On or after 25 August, Soviet submarine M-103 sunk by mine off Vormsi Island, Estonia.
On mid-September, Soviet cruiser-submarine P-1 was mined and sunk off Hanko.
On 28 September, Soviet submarine ShCh-319 was possibly the boat responsible for a failed torpedo attack reported on German cruiser Leipzig off Sworbe.
On 23 September, Soviet submarine M-74 sunk by German aircraft in Kronstadt. Raised in 1942 but deemed not worth repairing.
after 29 September, Soviet submarine ShCh-319 was lost by unknown reason but most likely mined.
On 11 October, Soviet submarine ShCh-322 was likely lost due mines.
On 13 October, Soviet submarine ShCh-323 attempted to attack the German cruiser Koln, escorted by torpedo boats off Estonia, but she is spotted and the attack is broken off.
On 16 October, Soviet submarine ShCh-323 torpedoed and sunk German merchant "Baltenland" (3724 GRT) off the Swedish coast. It was the only merchant vessel directly sunk with torpedo by Soviet submarines in the Baltic during this campaign.
On 5 November, last communication from Soviet submarine ShCh-324, most likely sunk by mines near Tallinn.
On 14 or 15 November, Soviet submarine M-98 sunk by mine in the Gulf of Finland.
Minelaying Operations.
Apart the early loss of submarine L-2, before she could lay the intended minefield in enemy waters, and the decommissioning of L-1 in August 1941, all the available Soviet submarines with minelaying capabilities were actively engaged. Due to the German defensive and offensive minelaying and subsequent British aerial mining, the success scored can't be confirmed. 
On 27 June, Submarine L-3 laid mines off Memel. These mines hit the following ships:
Submarine L-3 laid another field on 19 July, off Brusterort, but it was unsuccessful. 
On 12 August, Submarine Kalev laid mines off Uzava, Latvia. It is possible that on this field were lost:
On 17 August, Submarine Lembit laid mines west of Bornholm. On 1942 these mines hit the following ships:
Submarine Lembit laid another fields of mines on 5 November, in the Bjork Sound. Some Finnish ships were later damaged in the area, but Soviet mines were probably not responsible. 
On early November, was likely lost the Soviet submarine Kalev off Hanko, due mines.
On 14 November, Soviet submarine L-2 struck three different mines before sinking off Keri island. 3 survivors. The boat was departing to lay mines in Danzig Bay.
Outcome.
In the end, the Soviet offensive submarine operations in 1941 failed to achieve a significant success (like other navy's operations) and reason seems to be early poor command and organization, in addition to losses due to mines: the rapid ground advance of the Germans surprised the Soviets and further hampered the naval operations with the loss of harbors.
Another problem for Soviet submarines was operating in shallow waters, making little room for depth maneuvers in addition to the risk of mines and air attack.
The German ground advance forced all the Soviet vessels operating from Tallinn to retreat as part of the bloody Soviet evacuation of Tallinn, among the vessels lost there were the submarines S-5 and ShCh-301.

Gilda Langer

Gilda Langer (born Hermengild Langer, 16 May 1896 – 31 January 1920) was a German stage and film actress whose career began in the mid-1910s and lasted until her death in 1920. She appeared both on stage and in silent films; however, all films featuring Langer as an actress are now considered lost.
Early life.
Gilda Langer was born Hermengild Langer into a Sudeten German family in Oderfurt, Austria-Hungary (now, Přívoz, Czech Republic). Around 1915, she met Austrian dramaturge and screenwriter Carl Mayer in Vienna who then took her to Berlin and helped her to gain an engagement as a stage actress at the Residenz Theatre. Her first role at the theatre was in a production of the Robert Grötzach-penned 1917 play "Dyckerpotts Erben".
Film career.
In 1917, Carl Mayer announced to the film trade press that Langer would begin appearing in leading lady roles in several films for the newly created Berlin-based Star-Film company. Her first film role was in the 1917 Alexander Antalffy and Paul Leni-directed drama "The Mystery of Bangalore", opposite actors Conrad Veidt and Harry Liedtke. This was followed in 1918 by a starring role in the Jenő Illés-directed drama "Struggling Souls". After being introduced to filmmaker Fritz Lang, Langer would appear prominently in Lang's films "Halbblut" and "Der Herr der Liebe", both released in 1919.
In 1919, Gilda Langer was cast to play the role of Jane in the Robert Wiene-directed and Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz-penned German Expressionist horror film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari". However, Langer became ill before shooting and had to be replaced by actress Lil Dagover. Langer's last film role was in the Fritz Lang-penned and Otto Rippert directed 1919 drama "The Woman with Orchids".
Personal life and death.
In January 1920, Langer became engaged to Hungarian film director Paul Czinner. Langer fell ill with a lung infection after contracting the Spanish flu shortly after this engagement and died on 31 January 1920, aged 23. Her funeral was held on 4 February 1920 and she was interred at the Südwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf cemetery in Stahnsdorf, Brandenburg.

Corvallis Arts Center

The Corvallis Arts Center is a nonprofit organization whose stated mission includes conducting an array of "diverse exhibitions and cultural events" and providing the Corvallis, Oregon community with outreach and educational services relating to the arts. The center offers an ongoing series of art classes and camps, with a particular focus on the needs of at-risk youth. More than a dozen teaching artists working in a range of mediums conduct classes, exhibits, and demonstrations in connection with the center's work.
It operates from a historic building listed on the National Register of Historic Places as "Episcopal Church of the Good Samaritan", built in 1889.
Establishment.
The Corvallis Arts Center was created by the Corvallis Arts Council, founded in September 1961, to establish a showplace for the visual arts. At the time of its formation, chair pro tem was Marion Gathercoal. About 20 people participated in the establishment of the group during its first month of existence. Gathercoal was later formally elected as the group's first president by the membership of the council. The Corvallis Arts Council was incorporated as a non-profit corporation in March 1962. It was the first Arts Council in the State of Oregon and Twenty-first in the United States. 
Historic building.
For its location, the organization selected the religious assembly hall originally built by the Episcopal Church of the Good Samaritan. After the faith community moved to a different location in 1962, the site had been slated to become the location for a new temple for the Corvallis Elks Lodge. However, another location was eventually found for the lodge. In the meantime, the Arts Center gained access to the building on loan from the Corvallis chapter of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks late in 1962.
The building is striking for Carpenter Gothic style, especially its roof truss system.
The center immediately began fundraising to pay for a remodeling of the hall interior, including new paint, carpeting, and furnishings. Additional funds were generated through the sale of $10 "patronages" to interested community members. 
While the original lease of the building from the Corvallis Elks Club was a nominal $1 per year, maintenance and utility costs for the facility were pegged at approximately $15,000 per annum by the group's pro bono attorney, Robert Mix. Owing to the expense of the operation, suggestions were made as early as 1963 to place the facility under the umbrella of the Corvallis Parks and Recreation Department. 
In 1970, the building was moved about one block north to its current location, to Corvallis city property overlooking Central Park, to rest on a new concrete foundation.
In September 1971, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The center has remained in uninterrupted occupation of the facility for more than half a century.
Grand opening.
The grand opening of the Corvallis Arts Center took place on the weekend of January 26–27, 1963. Those displaying their works during the opening included graphic artist Junichiro Sekino (1914–1988) of Tokyo as well as a host of staff from the Art Department of Oregon State University. Local art groups including the Corvallis Weavers Guild and the Clay Clan, as well as other craftspeople, attended to demonstrate techniques, and a series of musical performances took place. Over 7,000 people from around Oregon visited the center over the weekend.
Currently
DBA The Arts Center, Inc., features rotating contemporary arts exhibits in Main Gallery, and Corrine Woodman Galleries, an ArtShop gift gallery with over 60 artists local/regional to Corvallis and Oregon, arts education opportunities for all ages, and programming to support working artists.

Cunningham Sanitarium

The Cunningham Sanitarium was a health institution in Cleveland, Ohio. Led by Dr. Orval J. Cunningham from the University of Kansas the facility was constructed to offer oxygen therapy on a large scale. The main structure for delivery of the treatment was a 900-ton steel sphere built in 1928. Consisting of five stories, the sphere stood at 64 feet and contained 38 rooms. 350 portholes helped to illuminate the rooms. The building was funded and built by the Timken Roller Bearing Company and linked to the three-story sanitarium hotel. It opened on December 1, 1928.
Dr. Cunningham chose to build the sanitarium at 18485 Lake Shore Boulevard near East 185th Street. The site, along the shore of Lake Erie, was chosen for its aesthetics. Dr. Cunningham believed that he could treat cancer and diabetes with hyperbaric medicine.
Dr. Cunningham sold the site to James Rand Jr., son of one of the cofounders of Remington Rand and protégé of Cunningham, in 1934. Rand reopened the buildings the following year as the Ohio Institute of Oxygen Therapy, making use of the unique facility. It did not last long and was soon turned into a general hospital under the name Boulevard Hospital. Financial problems led to its closure in 1937 and the site lay dormant until it was bought by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. The Cunningham Sanitarium building was razed on March 31, 1942 and the steel was used in the war effort. In 1950 the ground on which the sphere stood was turned into a school, St. Joseph High School, now the Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School. The main building was used as a hospital, Catholic Youth Organization headquarters and orphanage before becoming the St. Joseph Christian Life Center. This building was razed in 2010 and the property is used for green space by the Hospice of the Western Reserve, which owns the land.

Neighbors' Alternative

Neighbors' Alternative (; AV) is a left-wing political party active in the Comarca of A Coruña, Galicia. 
History.
The party was formed in 1979 by citizen associations of the 9 "parroquias" of Oleiros to run for the 1979 local elections (the first democratic ones since the Spanish Second Republic in the 1930s). The associations considered that the municipality had chronic problems of pollution, lack of schools, lack of urban planning and privatization of public services. AV won a landslide, with 4,113 votes (65.81% of the total) in the election. José Luis Martínez Suárez became the mayor of the municipality. In the 1983 elections the party suffered a setback, gaining only 5 seats and losing the mayor to the Socialists' Party of Galicia (PSdeG). AV won the elections again in 1987, and has won every single municipal election in Oleiros since then. Ángel "Gelo" García Seoane has been the mayor of the municipality since 2003. Between 1996 and 2003 the mayor was Esther Pita Pita (Seona was disqualified to hold public office during those years). Seoane had also been the mayor between 1987 and 1995. Prior to the 2015 local elections the party expanded its presence outside of Oleiros, to all the Comarca of A Coruña. In those elections AV presented lists in 3 municipalities: Culleredo (won 3 seats), Arteixo (no representation) and A Coruña (no representation). AV wants to expand its presence to more municipalities before the 2019 municipal elections.
Ideology and government.
The ideology of the party is based on left-wing politics and direct democracy. AV also supports anti-imperialist movements in Latin America (mainly the Cuban revolution) and Palestine. The mayor of Oleiros is supporter of Fidel Castro, that was declared an honorary councilor of the municipality in 1984, and the municipality has a statue of Che Guevara. 
Oleiros is also known for its urban planning, with a wide range of social services and public facilities: gyms and swimming pools, a network of libraries, centers for the elderly, playgrounds, green spaces, auditoriums, houses of municipal property that are given free to neighbors to organize parties and birthdays and artificial turf football fields. Oleiros has the higher indexes of social housing and green spaces per inhabitant of all Galicia.
Organization.
AV has a Monitoring Committee, an Executive Committee and permanent councils in the 9 parishes of the municipality. The party has a system of primary elections in which candidates are previously chosen by the parish assemblies of the party, to guarantee that all parishes have representation in the final list. The 30 elected candidates (3 for each parish) then run in an open primary election. 3,119 (11,8% of the registered voters of the municipality) people participated in the 2015 primaries.
People who are elected as council members are controlled by the Executive Committee. This system of citizen involvement in municipal management is also reflected in the participatory budget of the municipal council, in which the local citizen entities of each of the 9 parishes take part.

Eric George (doctor)

Eric George is an American medical doctor, best known as a hand surgeon. He is the founder and CEO of ERG Enterprises, Omega Hospital and The Hand Center of Louisiana in New Orleans. He is also a venture capitalist, real estate investor, author, and philanthropist.
Medical career.
Eric George grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, and graduated from Marshall University with a double major in chemistry and political science. After being accepted to both medical school and law school, George decided to become a medical doctor and was trained in orthopaedic hand surgery. George is a graduate of Marshall University's School of Medicine in 1989, completed a General Trauma Surgery Residency at Michigan State University and a Fellowship in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Grand Rapids Area Medical Education Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Subsequently, he completed an Orthopedic Hand and Upper Extremity Reconstructive Fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. He is board-certified and holds a certificate of Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand.
George is currently a Professor of Hand Surgery at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and Tulane University in New Orleans. George has published articles in academic journals including "Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery" and "The American Surgeon".
George founded the Hand Center of Louisiana, a surgical practice based in Metairie, Louisiana. In 2003, George co-founded Omega Hospital, a specialty surgical hospital, and became its CEO. Omega became the first physician-owned hospital in the greater New Orleans area. The luxury hospital focused on improving the patient experience by offering rooms with mini-bars, microwaves, and additional beds for family members to stay overnight. Today, George continues to serve as CEO of the Hand Center of Louisiana, where he works with the Saints and regularly treats NFL and NBA athletes, including Jimmy Graham and Anthony Davis, high-profile celebrities, and professionals in the oil and gas industry, as well as other businesses. George also maintains his role as CEO at Omega Hospital, where he actively practices full-time.
Since 2007, George has appeared in the annual list of Best Doctors®, a national peer-nominated survey of the best physicians across 450 specialties and subspecialties.
Business activities.
George's career as an entrepreneur and investor began in 2006, when he founded and became the CEO of ERG Enterprises, a venture investment firm based in New Orleans. In its early years, ERG made investments in healthcare facilities. That changed in 2009, when it partnered with The Berger Company to purchase the Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans. While the hotel was owned by London-based Orient Express Hotels at the time, the transaction would return the luxury hotel to local ownership. In 2011 George attempted to purchase the Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre when the theatre fell into financial disorder, however his bid wasn't successful.
Under George's direction, ERG Enterprises bought the famed Orpheum Theater in 2013, which suffered significant damage from Hurricane Katrina, shut down, and fell into a state of disrepair. George and fellow investors began plans to restore and enhance the original theater. The upgrade, which took over a year, included an expanded marble lobby, enlarged seating, additional bathrooms, multiple bars, and an auditorium floor that used hydraulics to accommodate the different surface requirements of concerts and events. The grand reopening of the theater occurred August 2015, just in time to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In 2020, the theater underwent a second major renovation under George's ownership. The basement of the theater was converted into an underground speakeasy called the Double Dealer, which opened January 24, 2020. In February 2021, the Orpheum celebrated its centennial anniversary. During the same month, it was chosen as the first of six U.S. sites by the World Food Program USA and Street Art for Mankind to feature a mural raising awareness about global hunger.
George's ERG Enterprises also invested in an $18 million renovation project of the Pythian building in New Orleans. In 2015, George and ERG Enterprises acquired the Pythian with Dr. William Bradshaw of Green Coast Enterprises and Crescent City Community Land Trust. They reopened the property in 2017 as an apartment building offering workforce-rate housing, a 20,000 square-foot food hall, office space, and healthcare facilities.
Today, ERG Enterprises owns Windsor Court Hotel, Pontchartrain Hotel, Royal Orleans Hotel, Westin Canal Place, The Frenchmen Hotel, and Thompson Nashville. In 2019, ERG co-developed a property on 300 Rampart Street in New Orleans with plans of opening it as a boutique hotel. Upon completion of the project, George commissioned the painting of a mural on its exterior by street artist Eduardo Kobra. The mural depicts the musician Louis Armstrong and was unveiled on the 118th anniversary of Armstrong’s birth. During the same year, ERG joined Gayle Benson and her investment company GMB Properties, The Berger Company, and Fulcrum Hospitality in acquiring the Hyatt Regency New Orleans, which is largest hotel acquisition in the history of Louisiana. In 2020, the company also purchased the old United Fruit Company building on Saint Charles Avenue. 
George is additionally the owner of a pineapple farm in Panama and several assisted-living facilities in the state of Louisiana. He has additionally founded and supplied a grade school in the city of Mombassa, Kenya. As of 2020, his net worth is estimated to be $500 million.
Writing.

William B. Jordan Farm

The William B. Jordan Farm is a historic farmhouse in Eagleville, Tennessee, U.S..
The farmhouse was built for William B. Jordan, a farmer who owned slaves, from 1847 to 1850. It was designed as an I-house in the Italianate and Greek Revival architectural styles. Moreover, "according to local folklore", the portico was designed by "traveling Italian craftsmen." However, Tennessee State Historian Carroll Van West believes there is no evidence this was the case.
The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since July 13, 1992.

James Robertson (surveyor)

James Robertson of Gossabrough FRS (1753–1829) was an 18th-century Scottish surveyor and map-maker.
Life.
He was born on the island of Yell in the Shetland Islands north of mainland Scotland, the youngest of ten children to John Robertson, a relatively wealthy merchant.
His family moved to Aberdeen in his youth and he was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School then studied at Marischal College in Aberdeen, graduating MA in 1778.
He moved to Jamaica in 1778/9 and leased out cattle to plantation owners. He made maps from at least 1791. In 1796 he successfully lobbied the House of Assembly to commission him for three years to map the entire island. He completed his one inch to a mile series of maps in November 1799 and was further commissioned to create more detailed maps which he completed in 1801. For the task he was paid £10,450, an absolute fortune at that time. He then went to London to organise for the printing (and sale) of his maps, which were published in 1804. In London he lived in the Pall Mall area.
In December 1810 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.
He unsuccessfully lobbied the Admiralty to commission the mapping of Orkney and Shetland, and unsuccessfully lobbied landowners to map Northumberland. However, he obtained a successful commission from local landowners to map Aberdeenshire. This was begun in 1810 but was not "completed" until 1822. But the commissioning group were less than happy with the result, which was proven to have multiple omissions. Robertson went to court in Edinburgh's High Court to receive the agreed payment but the issue remained unresolved at the point of his death in Edinburgh, on 15 January 1829.
By contrast, in the 1980s the Jamaican maps were compared against modern maps and found to be 98% accurate.

Hinterer Tajakopf

The Hinterer Tajakopf is a mountain, 2,408 metres high, in the Mieming Range in the Austrian state of Tyrol.
The Hintere Tajakopf may be ascended from the Coburger Hut (1,917 m) via the "Hinteres Tajatörl" (2,259 m) to the south and the south arête. Alternatively the Coburger Klettersteig runs to the top from the "Vorderen Tajatörl" to the north. This ascent is frequently combined with the klettersteig on the Vorderer Tajakopf (2,450 m) to the north of the Vorderes Tajatörl.
West of the summit at just under 2,300 metres are the remains of an abandoned mine. In the area around the Coburger Hut lead and zinc ore was mined until the 20th century.
On the actual summit is only a small wooden cross. A few metres away on a smooth rocky ridge, accessible via a short, protected passage, is a large summit cross with a summit register.

Ursula Biemann

Ursula Biemann (born 8 September 1955) is a Swiss video artist, curator and art theorist.
Born in Küsnacht, Biemann trained in art in Boston, Mexico and New York, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the School of Visual Arts in 1986. From 1995 to 1998 she curated the Shedhalle Zürich, and from 2000 to 2003 she taught at the Geneva School of Art.
Biemann's video art at first addressed the topics of gender, globalization and mobility in an essayistic and documentary-like style. Her later work focuses on resources, the ecology and the climate, and uses a more critical style involving mythical elements. Her works were first noted in the international media art scene before a first exhibition in Switzerland in 2009. Her works have been exhibited internationally since 1998, and are held by several "Fonds d'art contemporain" in France and Switzerland, as well as by the Centre national d'art et de culture Georges Pompidou in Rennes, the Musée d'Art du Valais in Sion, and the Generali Foundation in Vienna. She received the 2009 Prix Meret Oppenheim among other awards.
Biemann's writing addresses topics such as mobility, migration, feminism, the ecology and the Anthropocene, including the ancient trans-Saharan trade routes that are now being used by migrants.
