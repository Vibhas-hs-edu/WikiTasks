Social Call (Houston Person album)

Social Call is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2003 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
On All About Jazz, Jeff Stockton noted ""Social Call" is the mellow sound of the music as it used to be done. Even those who are indifferent to jazz, or even dislike jazz, can't help but enjoy this". In JazzTimes, David Franklin wrote: "Houston Person’s "Social Call" showcases breathy, subtone tenor. Indeed, beautiful melodies, lovingly caressed by Person’s sultry horn, constitute a generous portion of this recording. Slow tunes ... make up more than half the 11 tracks. Person treats them all with a lyrical sensitivity that allows the venerable melodies to speak for themselves". The Guardian selected it as their Jazz CD of the Week with Dave Gelly commenting "The whole thing is so agreeable that it's hard to pick bits out, but Person's firm, warm, unflappable ballad playing is a particular delight"

Little flying squid

The little flying squid ("Todarodes pusillus") is a species of squid, one of the arrow squids of the genus "Todarodes, in the subfamily "Todarodinae of the flying squid family Ommastrephidae. It is a small species from the waters around northern Australia and Indonesia.
Description.
The little flying squid is said to be dwarf species of flying squid compared to the other species of "Todarodes", the largest female recorded to date had a mantle length of 74mm and the largest male measured 68mm mantle. The maximum mantle length is not thought to exceed 100mm, compared to 500mm for the Japanese flying squid. It also has relatively small fins which only have a length equivalent to 25 to 31% of the mantle length (35-40% in the Japanese flying squid). It has a cylindrical, muscular body, typical of related species, which tapers to a short, pointed tail.
Its fourth right arm bears a hectocotylus on the distal half and has 11-13 normal suckers on its basal portion, ventral trabeculae which are broadened and joined forming low serrated fan with approximately 20 pairs of trabeculae. The second and third arms on each side are longer than the first and fourth arms being slightly less than half of the mantle length. The largest arm suckers have 9-11 sharp different sized teeth on distal two thirds of their rings. The height of the protective membrane on the arms is uniform and it is not higher than that of the suckers. The manus of the tentacles has 6-8 sucker rows in four series and the rings of the medial suckers on the manus have 16-18 moderately large, subconical teeth which alternate with low plates and are around 2.5 times largers than the marginal suckers in diameter. On the tentacles the protective membranes extends to the carpal region, its height never exceeds the sucker height and it has weak supports.
Distribution.
The little flying squid is found in northern Australia where it occurs in the regions of the continental shelf and upper continental slope. Its distribution extends from the Timor Sea and along the eastern coast of Australia from the Torres Strait south to waters off Brisbane. It has also been recorded in a narrow band extending north from the Timor Sea through the Indonesian archipelago to Mindanao in the southern Philippines.
Habitat and biology.
The little flying squid's biology is not well known. All specimens caught to date have been caught at depths of between 78m and 357m where the water temperature at depths of 50m was greater than 23 °C and that at the surface could reach 29 °C in the summer. A single trawl has caught up to 54 individuals which suggests that this species forms schools. Any females caught which are larger than 60 mm mantle length have all been sexually mature, with eggs present in their oviducts and all males with mantle lengths greater than 50mm bore mature spermatophores.
Taxonomy.
The little flying squid has been considered to be a subspecies of the Japanese flying squid but distinct differences are evident between the two taxa. More analysis, both morphological and molecular, is required to clarify their relationships. There are specimens from Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines which were described intermediate in some characters between the nominate form and the taxon treated here as "Todarodes pusillus". The smaller size and rapid gaining of sexual maturity in this taxa may be a result of living at higher temperatures than the related temperate form.

Nfat activating protein with itam motif 1

NFAT activating protein with ITAM motif 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NFAM1 gene.
Function.
The protein encoded by this gene is a type I membrane receptor that activates cytokine gene promoters such as the IL-13 and TNF-alpha promoters. The encoded protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) and is thought to regulate the signaling and development of B-cells. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].

Yukinori Yanagi

 is a contemporary Japanese artist.
Yukinori Yanagi is a contemporary Japanese artist who has addressed themes of national and transnational sovereignty, globalization and borders, as well as Japan’s imperial history and nationalism. He is considered one of the first postwar Japanese artists that is openly critical of Japanese society and governmental policy. Many of Yanagi’s artworks consists of large-scale, site-specific installations that engage with movement and symbols of nationalism.
Yanagi has exhibited his artworks widely in Japan and the United States, and became among the first foreign artists living in New York to be invited to exhibit at the Whitney Biennial, alongside Cai Guo-Qiang, in 2000. His artworks are in museum collections such as the Museum of Modern Art (USA), Tate Modern (UK) , Virginia Museum of Fine Art (USA) and the Fabric Workshop and Museum (USA). His vision for the revitalization of the island of Inujima was actualized as the Inujima Seirensho Art Museum in 2008, a permanent, six-part art installation that has become an integral location of the Setouchi International Art Triennale.
Early Life &amp; Education in Japan.
Early life.
Yanagi was born and raised in a rural region of Fukuoka, Japan. Growing up in the prefecture closest to the Korean Peninsula allowed Yanagi to grow up with a distinct awareness of the existence of other nations and cultures. He has spoken of his childhood experiences of picking up ‘everyday objects’ marked with Korean hangul that had washed up on the shore from the Sea of Japan as the beginning of his long-term interest in transpacific and transnational boundaries and movement.
Like many Japanese people of his generation, Yanagi's family was part of the Empire of Japan's Pacific War war effort. An awareness of this familial history has informed the artist's body of work: his father was a fighter pilot, and his paternal grandfather worked in border control in Japan’s former colony Manchukuo and was detained for more than a decade in Siberia and China following Japan’s surrender. In his artwork, Yanagi considers continuity and diversity with regards to his own position and the place of the Japanese nation within this tumultuous history.
Growing up in the 1960s before the development of widespread video games, Yanagi's childhood activities involved playing with insects in the countryside, especially ants and bagworm moths, and creating things out of various materials such as concrete and wax from a hardware store owned by one of his relatives. Furthermore, Yanagi’s uncle was avant-garde artist Miyazaki Junnosuke, a member of Kyushu-ha, which meant Yanagi was accustomed to seeing artistic objects and sculptures from an early age.
Education and Early Career in Tokyo.
Yanagi earned both a BA and MFA in painting from Musashino Art University in Western Tokyo (1985).
He was interested in the work of artists from the Mono-ha generation, especially of Noriyuki Haraguchi’s industrial sculptures, and became increasingly restless within the conventions of the University’s painting department. Despite being told that graduation work must be limited to flat works and oil paint only, Yanagi created a sculpture out of wooden supports and was subsequently excluded from the graduate thesis exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Tokyo. For his first solo exhibition the following year he burned all the artworks he made in art school and exhibited the ashes in large wooden boxes as the installation "Ground Transport Project" (1985). It was in this installation that Yanagi first included the element of live ants, a characteristic that he became known for throughout the 1990s.
From 1986, Yanagi began to exhibit artwork that addressed issues of “movement” from the perspective of an outsider of the art world’s system. This included his installation "Ground Transposition" (1987) that included large, spherical sculptures that were scaled to the human form in relation to the proportions to the size of dung beetles and the ball of dung that they roll as part of their ecology. The proportional scaling was a reference to the ancient Egyptian symbolism of the dung beetle as a ‘steward of the sun’ tasked with physically pushing the weight of the sun across the sky each day, which for Yanagi was a direct reference to the rising sun of the Japanese flag and the weight of Japanese nationalism that the artist felt. In the late 1980s Yanagi exhibited his work at various galleries in Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Fukuoka, including a prominent solo exhibition held at the Hillside Gallery in Daikanyama, in which he executed a smoky performance piece entitled "I Feel Yellow" (1987). He was awarded the Excellence Award in Art Document from the Tochigi Prefectural Museum of Fine Arts in 1987.
Move to the United States.
Despite the promising trajectory of his art career in Tokyo following his graduation, Yanagi was increasingly disillusioned with the Japanese art world, describing his feeling of “being trapped in a giant Japanese flag, in a cage, engulfed by national identity.” The artist moved to United States in 1988 to earn an MFA from the Sculpture Department of the Graduate School of Yale School of Art (1990), where he studied under Vito Acconci and Frank Gehry, among others.
At Yale, Yanagi started to expand on his engagement with Japanese nationalism and history after having the opportunity to read the works of prominent prewar Japanese intellectuals such as Nishida Kitarō and Kuki Shūzō, as well as texts and documents from or about the Pacific War that were difficult to access in Japan but available in the US. These studies allowed the young artist to gain a fuller picture of World War II, and question the omissions and identitarian narratives of both the Japanese and American perspectives of their national wartime history. He began to engage seriously with the idea of ""wandering as a permanent position"," creating artworks to dissolve the fixity of symbols associated with nations and regions, attempting to account for the changes that occur through time and circumstance.
Ants and National Boundaries - Late 1980s-1990s.
Artworks from Yale University, 1988-1989.
In the first year of his MFA at Yale University, Yanagi began thinking about the figure of the wandering ant as a multifaceted allegory for transnational movement. He began to regularly incorporate the insects into his artworks, a live element that became emblematic of Yanagi’s body of work from the 1990s. He thought of the ant colony as a perfectly organized communal society—exemplary on the one hand of a blind obedience, but also reflective of an unstoppable ecosystem of working parts that could surpass and dismantle any concept of national boundaries or borders.
Yanagi came up with the "Ant Following Plan" (1988) at the end of his first semester, in which he tracked the wandering movements of a single ant on the dark floor of his mostly empty 5-by-9-meter studio space using thick red chalk. Shortly after, he debuted "American Flag Ant Farm" (1989), which he crafted from an Uncle Milton toy ant farm by adding an extra panel with sand colored to appear as the American flag. The ‘wandering’ ants created tunnels that disintegrated the stars and stripes of the flag, overlaying macro and micro elements (nation vs ant) to dismantle and critique the permanence of the symbol of American national unity.
These earlier works would prove to be very impactful, informing much Yanagi’s works for the next ten years. He continued working on and expanding his ‘Ant Farm Series’ from 1990-2002. He also resurfaced the ‘ant following’ technique in 1994 for his ongoing series "‘Wandering Position’" (1994–Present)’ in which he performs site-specific live tracings of a wandering ant (San Diego, California in 1994; Alcatraz, California, 1996; Anomaly Gallery, Tokyo, 2021). He also uses this technique to create more conventional works for traditional gallery spaces on large format papers and copper plates.
Following his graduation from Yale, Yanagi moved to New York where he started to work internationally.
"World Flag Ant Farm" (1990).
In 1991, Yanagi exhibited "World Flag Ant Farm" (1990) at Los Angeles’s LACE (Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions) in one of the prominent solo exhibitions that launched his international career. "World Flag Ant Farm" was a large-scale installation consisting of 180 national ‘flags’ representing the members of the United Nations at the time. Each ‘flag’ was made out of a plastic box filled with colored sand in the pattern of the flag. They are interconnected by plastic tubes as they hung on the wall. As the title suggests, the entire artwork functioned as a multitude of interconnected ant colonies which could be viewed through the plastic by audiences. As the tiny insects tunneled through each flag and carried colored grains of sand to other areas, the colors and signs of national unity intermixed and began to dissolve the individual flags, creating a blurred image of a single, more ambiguous flag.
"World Flag Ant Farm" was well received and Yanagi's approach was considered ‘iconic’ especially in the context of the end of the Cold War and rising globalization and postcolonial studies, even being featured on the cover of the international art magazine Art in America, despite also facing harsh criticism from animal rights activists. The constant ‘wandering’ of the ants through each national symbol was exemplary of Yanagi’s ongoing engagement with the often muddled processes of globalization, the crossing of transnational borders, the diasporic movement of peoples, and the ultimate precarity of nationhood, race, and identity. Yanagi has said that he personally identifies with the piece, that it is related to the “borders I have had to cross or barriers I have confronted in trying to define myself as a Japanese.” "The World Flag Ant Farm" was exhibited at the 45th Venice Biennale in 1993, where Yanagi became the first Japanese artist to be awarded the Aperto Award as an emerging artist. In 1992, with the aid of the Asian Cultural Council, Yanagi was invited to the International Studio Program at PS1 Contemporary Art Center in New York.
This artwork marked the maturation of Yanagi’s ant farm idea and the beginning of a long series of "Ant Farm Projects" in which colonies of ants would slowly dissolve symbols of nationalism, including flags, currency, and American art. "World Flag Ant Farm" (1990) is in the collection of the Benesse House, Naoshima Contemporary Art Museum, Naoshima.
"Ant Farm Project" Series (1990-2002).
Yanagi produced many more flag-based ant farm projects with a wide variety of different geopolitical combinations in the years following his debut of "World Flag Ant Farm" (1990), while living in New York but traveling to Japan regularly. Some of the largest ant farm installations he made after "World Flag Ant Farm" include: "The World Flag Ant Farm 1991 -Asia-" (1991); "America" (1994), connecting all nations of North and South America; "Asia-Pacific Ant Farm" (1995); and "Eurasia" (2001). Some of the more political pieces he produced included: "The 38th Parallel" (1991) connecting North and South Korea; "Pacific - the Ant Farm Project" (1996), connecting Japan and the U.S.; "Union Jack Ant Farm" (1994), encompassing the former British Empire; "DMZ" (1995) connecting North and South Korea and an ambiguous zone between them that alluded to the DMZ; and "2 China" (1997), connecting China and Taiwan.
"Pacific - the Ant Farm Project" (1996) gained particular traction in art and academic circles and is now in the Tate Museum’s collection. To create it, Yanagi not only included the countries that border the Pacific Ocean, but also the nations that once had colonies in the Pacific, as well as indigenous groups like the Māori of New Zealand that have still not regained sovereignty over their territories. As such, the work challenged ‘neutral’ regional histories and symbols of sovereignty, instead engaging with the history of violent contestation in the Asia Pacific region.
"Money" Series (1999-2002).
In the later 1990s, Yanagi also began to create ant farm projects that engaged with a variety of national currencies, creating installations centering on large-scale motifs of American, Japanese, European, and other bills. Some works include "In God We Trust" (1999), "Dollar Pyramid" (2000), "Yukichi KV644955H" (2002), and "Euro Circuit" (2002). "Euro Circuit" consisted of 12 ant colony units, one to represent the highest value of cash currency for each country that originally joined the European Union. As the ants tunnel through the installation, the distinctive currencies gradually dissolve into a ‘universal’ banknote, demonstrating Yanagi’s reflections on the possibilities of a world becoming more and more transnational.
Imperial Symbolism and Article 9 - 1990s.
"Hinomaru" Series (1990-1992).
From the early 1990s, Yanagi also produced a series of sculptures and site-specific installations that aimed to deconstruct the nationalist ideology of modern Japan through the motif of the Hinomaru, or the Japanese flag. The first of these works, "Hi-no-maru 1/36" was produced for his first solo exhibition in New York at the alternative space STOREFRONT for Art and Architecture in 1990. "Hi-no-maru 1/36" (1990) was designed with consideration to STOREFRONT’s unique, triangular exhibition space. Positioned in a 10-part radial corner, Yanagi created an infinity mirror using reflections on opposing walls of angled mirrors in order to produce the illusion of one red circle with radiating beams, a direct reference to the flag adopted by the Japanese imperial army during the Pacific War. This work was exhibited alongside "American Flag Ant Farm" (1989), becoming a New York debut that demonstrated Yanagi’s ongoing engagement with the instability of national borders and his own ‘entrapment within mobility.’
One particularly acclaimed piece from this series is "Banzai Corner" (1991). For this work, Yanagi arranged rows of red Ultraman and Ultra Seven toy figurines into an arc with their bodies facing a mirrored corner to produce the image of a red circle. The uniforms of the toys create an illusion that once again alludes to the radiating beams of the Japanese Empire’s military flag. Each character has been carefully arranged so that its right arm is raised in the air to imply a victorious ‘Banzai’ in praise of the hinomaru, but viewers can see that in reality the figurines only celebrate their own reflection. Yanagi’s use of Ultraman and Ultra Seven figurines for this artwork has been attributed to the Okinawan identity of the character’s creator, Tetsuo Kinjō, who grew up during the American occupation of Okinawa. For Yanagi, the idea of alienation and otherness in Japan does not only refer to foreign nations, but also “to people living in Japan—Korean, Chinese, native Ainu, and Okinawans.”
Yanagi also produced a billboard-sized neon work, "Hinomaru Illumination" (1992) which was exhibited at his solo exhibition at the Benesse House, Naoshima Contemporary Art Museum, Kagawa in 1993; Art Market Fuji Television Gallery in 2001; as the central window artwork for the seminal exhibition “Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky” at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo in 1994; as well as again at his solo exhibition “Akitsushima” at the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art in 2001. This neon work is visually related to other Japanese neo-pop artists of the early 1990s, but it also exposes the “feeble foundation of national illusion” of national symbols that are harnessed when convenient—a symbol that can be turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at will. For example, for "Amaterasu and Haniwa" (1993) the neon flag was exhibited in the context of the Shinto Sun Goddess Amaterasu, alongside haniwa clay figurines that harken to the Kofun or Yamato period that has been associated with Japanese cultural origin. In addition, for "Hinomaru Container" (1992) Yanagi created another space of mirrored illusion within a shipping container shaped like an ancient tumulus (kofun) but cumulating with a refracted neon Yen symbol (¥), critiquing the conflation of consumerism and identity.
"Chrysanthemum Carpet" (1994).
Yanagi explicitly problematized the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere and its legacy in his work "The Chrysanthemum Carpet" (1994), first exhibited at Yanagi's solo exhibition at the Peter Blum Gallery in New York in 1995. The artwork consists of a large, red carpet designed to look like a Japanese passport. It included an outline of the trademark chrysanthemum flower that is the Imperial Seal of Japan, but with only one of its golden petals attached and the remaining 15 scattered around the expanse of the carpet. Black text woven into the carpet stands out starkly against the red background, reading “he loves me, he loves me not” in the languages of the Asian countries once dominated by Japan under the proclaimed Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. On the underside of the carpet, hidden from view, Yanagi inscribed texts from three distinctive sections of the Japanese Constitution: Article 19 (Freedom of thought), Article 20 (Freedom of religion), and Article 21 (Freedom of speech, press, and expression). Besides directly confronting the debate about national memory loss and historical revisionism regarding the war period, by juxtaposing the visible imperial symbol with the obstructed democratic constitutional guarantees hidden below, Yanagi's installation pointed to the structural contradictions of Japan's modernization. The Meiji Constitution that marked Japan's emergence as a modern nation state both restored the absolutism of the Japanese Emperor system as well as established a democracy, and furthermore Japan's postwar constitution was established by the U.S. Occupation forces. The artist's choice to obstruct the democratic principles from view on the underside of the carpet alludes to the subtle continuity of the survival of the Japanese emperor system, even in the postwar.
In the exhibition space, Yanagi's red carpet led to an Occupation-era photograph of SCAP General Douglas MacArthur standing with Emperor Hirohito, captioned as "Chrysanthemum and Sword" with a quote by poet and novelist Mishima Yukio superimposed in red, reading “"Why should his Imperial Majesty become human?"” This inclusion evokes criticisms of the continuities and discontinuities of Japanese sovereignty ‘before’ and ‘after’ of the Pacific War, implicating the resilience of Japanese nationalism as well as the American occupation of Japan decades later. About this work, the artist stated, ""All these people died for the emperor because they thought he was a god, and it turned out that he was just a small man with a human voice." Yanagi's carpet and the historical photograph have been installed together for several exhibitions together in the 1990s, including at the Art Tower Mito Contemporary Art Center in Ibaraki and the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, both of which also included war paintings from the Pacific War as part of the installation.
In 1997, Yanagi created a smaller version of the "Chrysanthemum Carpet" as limited edition multiple entitled "Loves Me/Loves Me Not" (1997) during his residency at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
""Project Article 9" Exhibition, 1995".
In 1995, 50 years after the end of World War II, Yanagi became the first artist to specifically address Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounced Japan’s ability to wage war after the end of World War II. To mark the significance of the year, the Queens Museum in New York hosted Yanagi’s solo show entitled “Project Article 9.” For this exhibition, Yanagi produced a series of textual installations that focused explicitly on the Article 9 clause in the postwar Japanese constitution. He modified a photograph of SCAP General Douglas MacArthur standing with Emperor Hirohito (the same photo utilized in his "Chrysanthemum Carpet" installation")" and prepared two new large-scale installation artworks, "Forbidden Box" (1995) and "Article 9" (1995).
Yanagi superimposed a historical photo of SCAP General Douglas MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito standing together with the full text of Article 9 of Japan’s Constitution in three different forms: the draft version originally written by MacArthur, the finalized Japanese version, and its English translation. According to the Queens Museum’s executive director Carma C. Fauntleroy, Yanagi’s concentration on textual elements and translation led "viewer[s] to reflect on the vagaries of communication through language and its implications in national and international arenas.”
Yanagi utilized his residency at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to create "The Forbidden Box" (1995) for the exhibition. The installation was made from two large-scale sheets of sheer nylon voile fabric, with screenprints of the giant mushroom cloud that occurred when the United States dropped the atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima in 1945. In addition to the image, the 17-foot-long sheets of fabric also depict the text from Article 9, with the version originally written by MacArthur printed on the rear sheet, and the English translation of the Japanese version in the front, intended as a way for viewers to see the differences in the rhetoric between the United States and Japan. Like a cloud of smoke, the sheets of fabric seem to billow out from a lead box that had the words “Little Boy,” the name of the atomic bomb, inscribed on the lid. Yanagi has stated that he included the box as a way to bring together two folktales, the Japanese children’s folktale of Urashima Tarō and the Greek myth of Pandora’s Box. On this, Yanagi stated, “universality of children’s tales enables us to know that we, as a species, share common core values and hopes all around the globe.” The mythologies of the box parallel Yanagi’s allegory for Japan that at once acknowledges Japan’s victimization in the aftermath of the atomic bombs but also the nation’s own role as a colonial aggressor in the Asia Pacific — the Pandora’s box revealed a hope for a future world with no more victims of nuclear warfare.
Yanagi also produced a large-scale neon light installation entitled simply “Article 9” for the exhibition, consisting of a set of neon signs encased in plastic box frames that spelled out the Japanese version of Article 9. However, the neon signs were disassembled, seemingly cast off in a pile of disjointed, glowing red parts incomprehensible as a whole. They cast red light around the exhibition space onto Yanagi's other works.
Yanagi’s artworks from the “Project Article 9” show went on to be exhibited in Japan at the Kirin Plaza Osaka in 1995. "Forbidden Box" and "Article 9" were also included more than 10 years later in Japanese curator Watanabe Shinya’s exhibition “Into the Atomic Sunshine” amongst works by other artists that engaged with Japan’s war history at Hillside Gallery in Daikanyama in 2008, Puffin Room in New York in 2008, and the Okinawa Prefectural Museum &amp; Art Museum in 2009.
Inujima Project - 2000s-Present.
Inujima Seirensho Art Museum.
In 1992, Yanagi was invited to hold a solo exhibition at the brand new Naoshima Contemporary Art Museum (now Benesse House at Benesse Art Site Naoshima). He fell in love with Naoshima and the Seto Inland Sea, returning many times from his studio in Japan in the years following, searching for an opportunity to start a long term project in the area that addressed the harmful scars that the rapid industrialization of Japan had left on the beautiful region during the Meiji Period. After three years of looking for an appropriate site, Yanagi came across Okayama Prefecture’s Inujima in 1995, a depopulated island scattered with the ruins of a copper refinery dating back to the industrial Meiji Period, and the inspiration for Yanagi's Inujima Project was formed.
In 1995, Yanagi came up with his vision for the revitalization of the entire island of Inujima; he aimed to revamp the long-defunct copper '"seirensho" (refinery) as a permanent, site-specific artwork using renewable energy, a project that was realized with the support from Benesse Corporation’s CEO at the time, Soichiro Fukutake. Yanagi and Fukutake were able to acquire Mishima Yukio's 'Shōtō House,' the former residence of the novelist and poet whose work Yanagi had engaged with in his artworks throughout the previous decade. Using dismantled and reconstructed parts of Mishima's residence, Yanagi spent years building a series of installations entitled "Hero Dry Cell" (2008) within the copper refinery, creating a permanent artwork that was also fused with the architectural heritage of the industrial site.
After 13 years of collaborative work, Yanagi's Inujima Art Project was opened in 2008 as the Inujima Seirensho Art Museum. The Inujima Seirensho Art Museum has become a forerunner of the Setouchi International Art Triennale, a contemporary art festival that takes place across the islands in the Seto Inland Sea. In 2010, the inaugural Setouchi International Art Triennale featured three installations created by Yanagi in collaboration with architect Kazuyo Sejima, in addition to the Injuma Seirensho Art Museum
Due to his long term project in Japan, Yanagi began traveling often between his studios in New York and Inujima, and eventually the artist closed his studios in the United States to move back to Japan full time. He set up in a self-designed studio situated on the north face of the mountains facing the Genkai Sea, in Itoshima City, Fukuoka prefecture. In 2005, he began working as an associate professor in the Faculty of Art at Hiroshima City University. He started a Contemporary Art and Theory Major in the Faculty of Arts and launched the Hiroshima Art Project, utilizing facilities that were unused due to the exposure to radiation as sites to exhibit artworks.
"Hero Dry Cell" (2008).
Inside the defunct copper refinery that makes up the Inujima Seirensho Art Museum, Yanagi spent more than a decade constructing a six-part permanent art installation entitled "Hero Dry Cell" (2008) that utilized mirrors, natural light, local stones, water elements, and architectural collage to create an interconnected, multi-layered installation about the modernization of Japan and legacy of the postwar.
"Hero Dry Cell" is made up of six parts that unfold inside the museum "like a hand scroll" in the following order: "Icarus Cell, Solar Rock, Slag Note, Mirror Note, Icarus Tower, and Solar Note". The second part, "Solar Rock" (2008) is of particular interest, using a natural light leak to create the illusion of a total eclipse—a black hinomaru. A black half shadow circle is created with light and then reflected in a dark pool of water gathered below on a large slab of local Inujima granite, creating the illusion of a full circle of a Black Sun rising, perhaps another addition to Yanagi's "Hinomaru" Series that critiqued the imperial-era nationalism associated with the Japanese flag. The granite megalith embedded into the ground of "Solar Rock" can be connected to Yanagi's keen interest in the Mono-ha movement. In front of the black hinomaru, Yanagi's 'architectural collage' appeared to float in mid-air as deconstructed panels of a tatami-mat room from Mishima Yukio's former residence lined up perfectly in alignment to lead the viewers' eye into the shadowy abyss of the Black Sun, even as the windows catch light and dazzle the retina simultaneously. This sensation is similarly described by the artist himself when recounting his first morning on Inujima in 1995: the rising sun made an "imprint on his retina" that developed into this six-part installation which functions an "after-image of the sun he saw that first morning."
Recent Years, 2010-Present.
After the completion of the Inujima Project, Yanagi has taken on more revitalization projects, such as the challenge of transforming an old junior high school on the remote island of Momoshima Island in Hiroshima Prefecture, establishing ART BASE MOMOSHIMA in the Onomichi Channel area in 2012.
In 2016, Yanagi’s large-scale solo exhibition at Yokohama’s BankART1929 explored the past three decades of the artist's oeuvre, filling the entire museum. He unveiled a new installation work, "Project God-zilla" (2016), an anti-nuclear work about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster of 2011.

Easy Living (Etta Jones album)

Easy Living is an album by vocalist Etta Jones that was recorded in 2000 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow states: "For one of her last recordings, Etta Jones sings a wide variety of standards, many of which she had not recorded previously. ... Jones gives each tune such a bluesy approach that she transforms them into new soulful pieces ... Recommended." On All About Jazz Mathew Bahl noted: ""Easy Living", Etta Jones’ wonderful new CD, is a celebration of a reunion and a partnership. The partnership is, of course, Ms. Jones’ longstanding collaboration with Houston Person. Mr. Person has played on and/or produced nearly all of Ms. Jones’ recordings since 1976. The reunion is with pianist Richard Wyands who in 1960 played for Ms. Jones on her breakthrough album, "Don't Go to Strangers". Ms. Jones’ nasal, instantly identifiable tone has only grown richer and more textured with age ... she makes the meaning of every song utterly explicit and delivers lyrics with an honesty that defies traditional notions of interpretation. In fact, of today's jazz singers, only Abbey Lincoln can match the sheer authority of Ms. Jones’ singing ... "Easy Living" proves the truth behind the old adage that there really are some things that do get better with age."

Kang Duk-kyung

Kang Duk-kyung (1929–1997) was a Korean comfort woman in the Japanese colonial era during World War II. She was captured and forcefully taken into sexual slavery by a Japanese soldier in the middle of the night. After liberation in 1945, she could not return to her hometown because of what had happened to her as a comfort woman. Kang Duk-kyung later became a human rights activist. She started to live in the House of Sharing in late 1992. While staying at the House of Sharing, she participated in an art therapy program where she began painting. Her art centers on her experiences as a 'comfort woman.'
Background.
Kang Duk-kyung was born in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province in 1929. Her father died when she was a young girl and her mother was remarried. As a result, she lived in her grandmother's house. She was a 14-year-old student at Yoshino School when one of her male Japanese teachers advised her to enter the Hujikosi airplane factory to work. He said it was a decent, well paying job. Kang Duk-kyung stated, “One hundred fifty people got on a ferryboat in Busan because their Japanese teachers said it was a good opportunity to earn money.” She eventually left the Hujikosi airplane factory in 1944 when she experienced hard working conditions and faced hunger. Several months later, at 15 years old, she was captured and taken by a soldier in the middle of the night. This was the beginning of her life as a militarized sex slave.
Kang Duk-kyung returned home a year after Korea's liberation, in January 1946. During this time she had also given birth to a baby. In returning home with child, Kang Duk-kyung's mother kicked her out of the house. With little support, Kang Duk-kyung decided to leave her child with a Catholic orphanage in Busan. Kang Duk-kyung stated, “I had no affection for my child at that time.” Her feelings towards her child eventually changed. She was working in a restaurant in Busan and decided to go visit the baby one day, only to be informed that her baby had died. She was told that the cause of the child's death was pneumonia and was not permitted to identify the body. Kang stated “I still don't believe it because I haven't seen my child in real life. Since then, I have been devastated.” Her experience as a 'comfort woman' also left her with lifelong debilitating health issues. Her reproductive system was compromised and she poured most of her money into medical bills throughout her life.
Kang Duk-kyung died in 1997 after a long battle with lung cancer.
Activism.
Soon after Kim Hak-sun came forward with her story in 1991, Kang Duk-kyung began speaking publicly about her experiences as well. She moved into the House of Sharing along with Kim Bok-dong and Kim Soon-duk. Like the other survivor-residents, Kang Duk-kyung was upset that the Japanese government and military denied their involvement with the torture that she and others had endured during their time as ‘comfort women.’ She committed to advocating and bringing awareness to the issue of sexual slavery and the lives of other ‘comfort women.’ She protested and raised awareness with many broadcast and media interviews. She became one of the movement's most outspoken members, testifying at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva and at an assembly in Japan at the invitation of a Japanese civic group. She fiercely demanded a legal apology from the Japanese government. Kang Duk-kyung faithfully and enthusiastically participated in the Wednesday Demonstrations. Kang Duk-kyung's overall health was failing and she often had to shuffle between being in the intensive care unit and a general ward. Despite this, her enthusiasm and commitment to other ‘comfort women’ and the movement, prevailed. She participated in the Wednesday Demonstration whenever she recovered a bit of strength. In 1996, in the later stage of her cancer battle, Kang Duk-kyung attended the Wednesday demonstration in a hospital ambulance.
Kang Duk-kyung was prolific during her time at the House of Sharing in the art therapy program. Her works have been exhibited globally and contribute to raising awareness of the 'comfort women' issue. Thirty of her artworks, including "Stolen Innocence", were put on display in the exhibition hall at the House of Sharing.

Can't Deny Me

"Can't Deny Me" is a song by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam. The song was released on March 10, 2018 as a digital download exclusively on Pearl Jam's "Ten Club" fan club, and was released as a single via streaming and digital download on March 12, 2018. "Can't Deny Me" peaked at No. 11 on "Billboard"s Mainstream Rock chart. Originally announced as a track from the band's then-untitled forthcoming album, the song was left off "Gigaton" (2020).
Release.
Pearl Jam posted a 25-second preview of "Can't Deny Me" on Twitter on March 10, 2018. The song was released as a surprise download to Pearl Jam's Ten Club members on the same day. It was also streamed on Sirius XM's Pearl Jam Radio. On March 12, 2018, the single was made available for streaming and digital download. The song was uploaded to the band's official YouTube channel on March 14, 2018.
Bassist Jeff Ament created the single's artwork in collaboration with Pearl Jam's longtime videographer, Kevin Shuss.
Live performances.
Pearl Jam performed the song for the first time during their concert at Movistar Arena in Santiago, Chile on March 13, 2018. Lead singer Eddie Vedder, speaking in Spanish, dedicated the song to "the incredible students in Florida and the United States, who survived a terrible tragedy. We will all be protesting tomorrow throughout the United States," Vedder said in reference to the nationwide school walkout in protest of gun violence that took place on March 14, 2018.
While introducing the song at Pearl Jam's concert in Amsterdam on June 13, 2018, Vedder sarcastically told the crowd that the song "has nothing to do with Donald Trump", and "I wouldn't want to waste my breath."

<doc id="56826744" url="?curid=56826744" title="Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights">
Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights

The Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights was initially drafted by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education with the support of Seoul's Education Chief, Kwak No-hyun, on September 7, 2011 and was introduced to the Seoul City Council for consideration in October, 2011. The ordinance was officially proclaimed on January 24, 2012. The push for Seoul's ordinance came after both the Gyeonggi Province (2010) and City of Gwangju (2011) enacted their respective ordinances. In addition to political initiatives for the ordinance, there were several groups advocating for its passage, like Common Action for Sexual Minority Students and the Youth Human Rights Group, Asunaro. The objective of the Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights, as it states in its first chapter, is "to ensure that all students' dignity and values as human beings are fulfilled and that they can live a free and happy life." The ordinance provides a variety of provisions and protections to students attending kindergartens, elementary schools, and high schools in Seoul. The ordinance protects student’s freedom of conscience and religion as well as their freedom of expression, which includes demonstrations and forms of protest on school grounds. The ordinance also offers protective guidelines against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, physical violence (corporal punishment), compulsory studying after school hours, among many other protective clauses. It is important to note that Seoul's Ordinance of Student Rights in not legally binding, but works more as an educational charter for school administrators in Seoul. The ordinance also stipulates rules around a governing Student Human Right Committee that oversees the implementation of the ordinance in schools, as well as handle issues or violations that may surface as the ordinance is in place. The ordinance also includes guidelines for a Student Participation Committee, which is meant to represent Seoul's student population in relation to the Student Human Rights committee.
Controversy and Backlash.
Despite the overwhelming public and political support for the passage of the Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights, there were several instances of community and political pushback. Groups like the Korean Federation of Teachers’ Association (KFTA) adamantly opposed the adoption of the ordinance, citing a poll in which 76% of teachers in Seoul disagreed with the ordinance . The KFTA has also stated that the rights of children in kindergarten in accordance with Seoul's ordinance, are a show of "‘human rights populism’ and that [Seoul's ordinance] neglects duty and responsibility in the name of protecting human rights.” Other groups like The Association of Mothers Concerned about Education and The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) also voiced their opposition of the ordinance.
2017 Amendment.
In September, 2017, the Seoul Metropolitan Council amended the Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights to expand on provisions against hate speech. This move was made amidst mounting worries of verbal abuse in Seoul's schools.
Corporal Punishment.
Prior to the enactment of the Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights there was a specific ban on all forms of corporal punishment enacted by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education in July 2010. It was spearheaded by the head of the office, Kwak No-hyun. Chapter 2 Section 2 Articles 6 (Right to be Free from Violence) and 7 (Right to Safety from Danger) are the direct sections which refer to corporal punishment and violence within the ordinance. Article 6 explicitly bans all physical and verbal abuse including; corporal punishment, bullying, sexual violence. Students are to be free from intentional disclosure of information that may lead to harassment due to prejudices of a particular group or social minority. The head of schools must make sure to prevent all physical and verbal abuse as described above. Article 7 states school leaders should maintain a safety management system to ensure student safety. If any accidents are to occur at school, school leaders are to help rescue the victims quickly and cooperate with relevant authorities and local residents to prevent damages. There has been a ban in place prior to the enactment of the Ordinance, but both are hard to enforce, so even though corporal punishment is seen as detrimental to the mental health and learning environment of students there is little to currently stop it from continuing.
Backlash.
People who are opposed to the ordnance fear that the banning of corporal punishment will lead to teachers diminished ability to control their classrooms and to punish violent students. Some who are opposed believe that the protections put forth by the ordinance are redundant because there are already laws against discrimination and corporal punishment. Corporal punishment continues, despite the ban and ordinance, in private schools because they often have a set of rules that attending students agree to and the schools often get permission from parents.
LGBT Protections.
The Seoul Student Human Rights Ordinance is the first student rights ordinance in South Korea to include protection on the basis of gender identity. The inclusion of protections on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in the Ordinance were highly controversial, with conservative organizations arguing that these protections promote homosexuality and progressive organizations claiming the protections protect LGBT students.
 In 2011, many student and nonprofit organizations mobilized to pass a Seoul Student Human Rights Ordinance that included protections on the basis of sexual minority status and gender identity. In early 2011, groups like the Korean gay men's organization Chingusai began collecting signatures in favor of the Ordinance from the public and performing signing ceremonies. Major signing campaigns were hosted at Children’s Grand Park on March 6, 2011 and in Seoul Plaza on May 6–7, 2011.
 The efforts of such events culminated in the acquisition of over 90,000 signatures from Seoul citizens approving the Ordinance and its protections for LGBT students.
 As the ordinance received increasing public support, the protections for LGBT students were targeted by conservative groups. In order to ensure the inclusion of LGBT protections in the ordinance, multiple LGBT organizations including Chingusai and Solidarity for LGBT Rights of Korea collaborated to hold three emergency meetings on September 14, September 22 and October 4, 2011.
 Together, LGBT groups organized social media initiatives, spoke at public events such as the 2011 National Workers Convention, and orchestrated protests.
Implementation of the Ordinance.
Many cases where the ordinance has been implemented have been observed within the education system. In Seoul, a middle school ethics teacher was investigated by the Office of Education due to her hateful comments addressed toward homosexual individuals. The students reported their teacher to an online portal for petitions called Sinmungo. The informants claimed the teacher said, “homosexuality is an abominable and filthy crime. Homosexuals should be gathered in one place and burned.” Under the Ordinance for Students’ Rights, no minorities could be discriminated against. Homosexual individuals also fell into the minority category and the teacher was investigated.
Another case where the Ordinance of Students’ Rights was implemented was in 2016, when an instructor at a private university in Seoul was fired for hate speech. The instructor was hired to teach liberal arts but instead she used her platform to promote a hateful attitude towards homosexuality. During class she referred to homosexuality as a disease and claimed that all homosexual individuals were infected with HIV/AIDS. She pushed her students to complete assignments that forced them to agree with her views, which eventually led to students organizing and protesting to get her fired. She was then fired from her position. The university made it a requirement following that incident for teachers to refrain from engaging in hate speech.
Progress for Minority Students in Higher Education.
The Ordinance of Students’ Rights served as a gateway to the Seoul National University Human Rights Guidelines. The importance of having students’ voices be heard is found in the creation of anti-discriminatory legislature such as this. On September 7, 2016 the Seoul National University Human Rights Guidelines were added upon during a meeting which unanimously voted to pass the law that prevents people from discriminating against sexual minorities. This faced a lot of backlash from religious organizations such as the Seoul National University Christian Faculty Association and the Christian Alumni Association. Regardless of the backlash, sexual minorities would be protected under the new guidelines that were passed.
There has also been in increase in the election of students who have came out as being homosexual to serve as council members on the university councils. One example of a homosexual individual who has been elected to serve on a university council is Bo-mi—who was elected to be president of the Seoul National University student council.

Tribhuvana Mahadevi I

Paramavaishnavi Goswamini Devi or Tribhuvana Mahadevi I (Odia: ପ୍ରଥମ ତ୍ରିଭୁବନ ମହାଦେବୀ) was the first female ruler of the Bhaumakara Dynasty in ancient Odisha and the widow of king Santikara I who ascended the throne of Toshali or Utkala between the years 843 A.D to 845 A.D and ruled until 850 A.D after the premature death of her ruling son Subhakara III. Some historians believe that she might have ruled as long as 863 A.D abdicating the throne for her grandson Santikara II after he turned older and eligible to run the administration. She was a very powerful female ruler and found appreciating mentions as a beholder of lavish power and prestige by the Arab and Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh and explorer Ahmad Ibn Rustah. She rose to power despite feudal kings of coastal-central parts of erstwhile Tri-Kalinga region rebellions and with the help her powerful father. She compared herself with the Goddess Katyayani (a form of Goddess Shakti) when she ascended the throne at Guheswarapataka mentioned in her Dhenkanal charter. She is also credited for the construction of the Baitala Deula which is one of the oldest surviving temple structures standing erect to this day in old Bhubaneswar and one of the few in Odisha built in Khakara style temple architecture.
Origin and Personality of the Queen.
The origin of Tribhuvana Mahadevi I as a royalty is still disputable among historians as it is believed by some that she was the daughter the king Rajamalla I of Mysore while other historians rest their theory that she was the daughter of a king from the early Eastern Gangas from the southern neighbor of the Bhaumakara kingdom. The Dhenkanal charter of queen herself gives an indication about how the Eastern Gangas of Kalinga were first defeated by the earlier Bhaumakara king Sivakara I and then restored to power after they accepted his suzerainty, establishing relationship of good faith between the two royal families which could have ended up in matrimonial alliances. Her descendant Sivakara III mentions in his inscriptions that Tribhuvana mahadevi I was filled with three energies Mantra Shakti (the power of divine chants), Prabhu Shakti (Spiritualism) and Utsaha Shakti (energetic). She was described as a Pitrabhakta (devout child to her parents) meditating at the feet of her parents. Her Dhenkanal charter has associated full imperial epithets to her and describes that as a person she was adorned with hundreds of auspicious signs to be a superior ruler in the world. She was a devout Vaishnavite who worshiped Hari and took the epithet as Paramavaishnavi.
Ascension to the Throne.
The Dhenkanal charter issued by Tribhuvana mahadevi I describes her ascension as " "her lotus-like feet being softly kissed by the crowns and headpieces of the great vassal and feudal kings, bowing down in devoted loyalty before her and the foot-stool of her late husband became radiant with the splendor of the diamonds in those diadems of the subjugated kings"". In the preceding years before the ascension of her husband Santikara I, the Pala dynasty king Devapala had defeated the reigning king Sivakara II and subjugated the Bhaumakara rulers in Odisha. The dynasty had lost its prestige and power after this defeat which was followed by disorder in the kingdom. The subsequent deaths of Santikara I and Subhakara III as the male eligible heirs, gave rise to rebellion by feudal kings. The inscriptions of later Bhaumakara kings states that the widowed queen took upon the burden of administration of the entire kingdom and shone like Sesha, holding up the entire earth on her hood. The queen herself has credited her father to have come to rescue of the Bhaumakara rule suppressing the rebellions and helping her restore authority and order in the kingdom.
Administration of the Kingdom.
According to the charters issued by her and her descendants she is credited to have ensured an effective administration of the kingdom and prosperity of the people. Talcher plate of Subhakara IV states that during her rule the country advanced in administration, enemies were destroyed, the glory of the kingdom spread abroad and the people lived in harmony. She paid special attention in appointment of responsible and honest royal officials and the vassals of the kingdom stayed loyal to her supremacy. She exerted Mrudukara (light taxation) on her people. Her Dhenkanal charter talks about how Bhaumas exhausted treasures of their vast empire on religious works in order to enlighten their own country and others, and decorated the earth by constructing in unbroken continuity, various mathas, monasteries and temples.
During her rule and as evident from her grants and charter issued during her rule, she patronized Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism while the existence of the Jain and Buddhist ideologies in the kingdom remained uninfluenced by any kind of threat. Women in the kingdom were educated and able exert special powers and administrative rights for issuing land grants and charters. She was able to suppress internal rebellions and expel the enemy forces of the Rashtrakutas and Palas with the help of her father securing the kingdom from any external threats. She commanded a standing army of 3,00,000 men and women were also believed to have indulged in military affairs. She restored stability to the kingdom after a long era of chaos and disorder initiating a golden era of stability, economic prosperity and cultural growth. She served as an example for a line of another six descendant female rulers who ruled in the Bhaumakara kingdom in their own rights despite the availability of heirs and two of which even adopted her royal epithet as Tribhuvana Mahadevi.

Charles Manthorpe

Rev. Charles Manthorpe (31 March 1836 – 6 December 1898) was a Congregationalist minister remembered for his 36-year pastorate in Glenelg, South Australia.
History.
Manthorpe was born and grew up in Norwich, East Anglia, and began his working life as a teacher in nearby Peafield, and was engaged as a lay preacher in nearby villages. Encouraged and guided by his pastor, Rev Mr. Alexander, he studied for the Christian ministry and after a few years was appointed to the Congregational Church at Long Stretton, then in 1856 was called to Newport, Essex, where he was ordained and succeeded the old Rev. Mr. Hopkins.
This was at a time when missionaries were competing to develop churches in the farthest reaches of the British Empire, and at Rev. J. L. Poore's urging Manthorpe accepted a call to South Australia in 1858.
On arrival he was posted to the churches of Happy Valley and Morphett Vale, whose incumbent, the Rev. A. R. Philps had been transferred to Truro.
In 1861 he was appointed co-pastor of the old Freeman Street (now Gawler Place, Adelaide) church, whose pastor C. W. Evan was in poor health.
In May 1862 he was called to take over the Glenelg church, which was in serious trouble: the popular and enthusiastic Rev. Charles Edwin Palmer, who had on the basis of a swelling congregation taken out a large loan to replace the 1848 church, built by H. J. Moseley, then abruptly resigned to become ordained in the Church of England. By April 1861 the Sunday School was disbanded and the congregation shrunk to a dozen shouldering a debt of £1,300.
Manthorpe commenced at Glenelg in May 1862, and immediately had the church interior finished and made more attractive. Under his pastorate the congregation returned and the Sunday School re-established and within a year the debt had been reduced by £500. He had a new manse built at a cost of £1,050. By 1877 the building was clearly inadequate to the purpose and plans were made for a replacement on the adjoining block at a total cost of £6,900. In September 1879 the new building measuring with seating for 700, now St Andrews Uniting Church, was opened at 92 Jetty Road, Glenelg.
During his 36-year pastorate Manthorpe returned to England twice; on the first, undertaken in 1875 with his son Charles Edward, the ship's cargo of wool caught fire and the "Aurora", on her maiden voyage, had to be abandoned off the Azores and the journey completed on another vessel. His second was undertaken in 1891 as a delegate to the International Council of Congregational Churches in London. Shortly after his return he resigned, leaving in 1892, though he remained the titular pastor until April 1898.
For several years he was without a charge, preaching at special services and acting as temporary replacement as opportunity arose, notably the tiny New Parkside Congregational Church which had hitherto relied on lay preachers. Gradually attendance increased, and again the necessity for a larger building became evident. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Mrs. S. J. Way.
At its first service on 27 November 1898 Manthorpe was due to read the first lesson, but he was so frail, his eyesight so poor, and his voice so weak that his friend F. W. Cox was obliged to take over the duty.
Manthorpe attended several services in the new building before his death.
Family.
Charles Manthorpe (31 March 1836 – 6 December 1898) married Harriet Whitridge Baker ( –1920) on 20 October 1859. Harriet was the eldest daughter of Rev. E Baker, of Morphett Vale. Their large family included:

Aliyah Saleem

Aliyah Saleem (born August 1989), is a British secular education campaigner, writer and market researcher. She is an ex-Muslim atheist, feminist and humanist activist, and co-founder of advocacy group Faith to Faithless. She has also written under the pseudonym of Laylah Hussain.
Biography.
Saleem was born in London into a Pakistani Sunni Muslim immigrant family. From age 6 to 11 she attended Deobandi Arabic-led madrasas, where she learnt the Arabic language and was taught Salafi Islam. When she was 11 years old, Saleem entered the Islamic girls' private boarding school Jamia Al-Hudaa in Nottingham. Around 12, she began having doubts about the truth and ethics of religion, especially the condemnation of homosexuality, but her questioning was branded "corruption" and she felt repeatedly repressed to "not pollute the minds of other girls". She was expelled in 2006 at the age of 15, accused of "narcissism" for owning a disposable camera and consequently publicly humiliated in front of the entire school.
She went on to study Koranic interpretation at Farhat Hashmi's Al-Huda Institute in Mississauga near Toronto, Canada, which was intended to last a year. Finding the lessons in Urdu difficult, however, after two months she transferred to the Al-Huda Institute's campus in Pakistan to complete the course and, segregated and isolated from her family, she found herself "sucked in" by the repetition and religious zeal. She started to willingly wear the face veil (niqab), and in hindsight she considered her 17-year-old self to be a fundamentalist who wanted to proselytise when she returned to the UK.
Back in Britain, where Saleem was no longer in a religiously restricted environment and had free access to books, media and television, her earlier doubts resurfaced. She started studying sociology, which examined religion from several new perspectives such as feminism and Marxism, and first exposed her to the concept that religions could serve as a means of social control. In the library, she came across Richard Dawkins' book "The God Delusion", which first exposed her to the idea that God could be a human delusion and might not actually exist, and the theory of evolution, which she did not understand, and decided to spend a great deal of time on studying further. After that, she educated herself on cosmology, and read Carl Sagan's "Pale Blue Dot"; the sight of the iconic Pale Blue Dot photograph was the last straw, brought her to disbelief and made her a sceptic. By the age of 19, Saleem had reached a point where she no longer believed in Islam, and moved away from it. She believes that "The Islam that I grew up in, that had been, you know, shoved down my throat for years, was actually being shoved down my throat to actually control me. To control what I did, what I wore, who I spoke to, and what I ate and how I thought."
Saleem attended Brunel University in west London where she obtained a first class honours degree in English. She is a market researcher for Kantar having previously done parliamentary research work for the House of Lords. She is also a contributor and advice columnist to "Sedaa", a website featuring writers from Muslim backgrounds.
Secular activism.
In October 2014, Saleem first spoke out about her treatment at her Nottingham boarding school at the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain's Secular Conference 2014. In November 2014, she also wrote a more detailed exposé about it in "The Times" under the pseudonym of Laylah Hussain. Saleem claimed that pupils were only taught various Islamic subjects from a fundamentalist perspective, indoctrinated them with anti-gay, anti-Christian and anti-Jewish views, and had no geography, history, art, sport or music classes. The science class omitted evolution and sex education, and she was taught that men are permitted to beat their wives. Due to the concerns she raised, the school was subjected to an unannounced inspection in April 2015, and rated as 'inadequate' by Ofsted as a result. When a second inspection in April 2016 did not show sufficient improvements, Jamia Al-Hudaa Residential College was threatened with partial or full closure. The school's management attempted to appeal the decision, while Saleem urged the Department for Education to "move swiftly now to protect these pupils."
In 2015 Saleem, with her colleague Imtiaz Shams, an ex-Muslim atheist from Saudi Arabia, co-founded the advocacy group Faith to Faithless. The organisation provides support for people leaving Islam and other minority religions, challenges discrimination faced by non-religious people and aims to create awareness of the issues involved in leaving religion. Saleem and Shams began by holding "coming out" events at universities, where ex-Muslims and other apostates could tell their stories in the presence of peers who had also been through deconversion.
In 2015 Saleem represented Humanists UK (then the British Humanist Association) at a diversity chamber debate in the House of Lords in which she spoke about the discrimination and persecution faced by many ex-Muslim atheists in the UK and around the world. The following year she represented Faith to Faithless at a further debate in the Lords about the particular problems ex-Muslims face when leaving religion.
In late 2015 and early 2016, Saleem recorded two videos offering strategies for Muslim or ex-Muslim women who no longer want to wear the hijab – she herself had worn a headscarf from the age of 11 – but are wary of the negative social consequences they may face for doing so.
In April 2016 Saleem appeared in the BBC Radio 4 two-part documentary programme about the Deobandis, the isolationist traditional Muslim community that was responsible for her schooling and which controls the majority of Islamic religious schools in the UK.

Beth Slingerland

Beth Slingerland was an educator who developed a classroom adaptation of the Orton-Gillingham system for teaching dyslexic children. Called the Slingerland Screening for Identifying Children with Specific Language Disability, the test screens to identify language disabilities and is divided into eight subtests. While the director of the lower school at the Punahou School in Hawaii from 1938-1945 she became interested in this issue. On December 7, 1941, Beth was a witness to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Her Husband, John Slingerland, was a civilian employee on the naval base. She witnessed these attacks from her home in the hills above the harbor, and described the scene she saw in a detailed letter to her mother and father. Throughout the letter, she describes with time stamps: the sounds of guns, smoke rolling over the hills, and her worries for her husband. In the letter, she states, “ I have to do something because I can see the smoke pouring up into the air from Pearl Harbor and the sound of the guns and the bombs bursting in the water right before us keeps me in such a nervous state that I must do something. John is at Pearl Harbor.” She also describes partially what her husband witnessed. These letters give a raw point of view of this horrific attack. In the late 1940s she became the coordinator of a language disability program in the Renton, Washington school district where she worked until 1965. In 1977, she founded the Slingerland Institute in Bellevue, Washington. The Institute trains 600 teachers in the US and Canada and recently opened a training program in Australia. She died in Seattle in March 1989 at 89 years old.

Yuka Ogata

 is a Japanese local politician and a member of the Kumamoto City Assembly. She was first elected in the 2015 local elections, winning 4,196 votes in the Higashi Ward of Kumamoto. Before entering public office, Ogata was an officer in the Yemen office of UNDP.
Baby in assembly controversy.
Ogata was the center of a November 2017 controversy in the City Assembly. Unable to obtain a nursery spot, she entered an assembly session with her infant son to highlight the difficulties facing children-raising working Japanese parents and the lack of nursery spaces. Soon after taking her seat, the council speaker Yoshitomo Sawada and his colleagues confronted her to ask why she had brought her infant into the chamber. After several minutes, Ogata yielded and was escorted to the speaker's office. She then returned to the delayed session alone after leaving her son in a friend's care. Sawada later apologised for opening the session 40 minutes late, but another assemblyman was heard to implicitly blame Ogata instead for the episode. The assembly did not have a rule prohibiting members to enter the chamber with their children, but the assembly considered the baby as a visitor, who is required to sit in the gallery.
The local incident unexpectedly gained national and international prominence. It was cited as a proof that the current environment is hostile for Japanese women juggling between their careers and families, and even worse for those in politics. Commentators observed that Ogata's actions illustrated how the impact Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's womenomics policies were still limited. Ogata also criticised the fact that women with children were rarely consulted in policy making.
Ogata was later reprimanded by the assembly for disrupting proceedings. The assembly passed a proposal in February, banning any non-members from entering the debating chamber as a response to the November incident.

Operation Billings

Operation Billings was a US search and destroy operation conducted by the 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division north of Phước Vĩnh during the Vietnam War. The operation was conducted from 12 to 26 June 1967.
Background.
In early June U.S. intelligence learned that the Viet Cong (VC) 271st Regiment, 9th Division was moving into the area north of Phước Vĩnh. 1st Infantry Division commander MG John H. Hay decided to launch a preemptive attack.
Operation.
The operation commenced on 12 June as 1st Infantry battalions moved progressively north of Phước Vĩnh. MG Hay came to believe that the 271st had moved to a large clearing designated
Landing Zone X-Ray ()(a different location from the landing zone of the same name that was the scene of the Battle of Ia Drang), where he suspected that the VC would be preparing to ambush a helicopter landing and so he ordered Colonel Sidney Marks' 3rd Brigade to LZ Rufe () and then proceed overland to LZ X-Ray.
On the morning of 17 June preceded by a moving barrage, the 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, entered LZ X-Ray. The 1/16th Infantry established a perimeter 30-50m into the tree line around the clearing and waited for the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment to arrive. As the first units of 2/28th Infantry arrived X-Ray, a patrol reported a group of VC approaching from the northwest. At 13:00 the VC attacked, penetrating the northern and northwestern perimeters before being forced back by artillery and gunship support. The VC then launched a second attack against the southeast perimeter and despite heavy defensive fire overran the defending platoon with the survivors withdrawing into the center of the perimeter to form a new defensive line. At 13:45 air strikes forced the VC to begin to withdraw and they disengaged under cover of a steady mortar barrage. U.S. losses were 35 killed. A search of the immediate area found 226 VC dead. Over the next few days the Americans found more VC dead, in one assembly area 35 were found killed by artillery and airstrikes.
Airstrikes and ambushes were set on the 271st Regiment's likely withdrawal routes, but there was minimal additional contact.
Aftermath.
The operation concluded on 26 June 1967. It was considered a success with a total of 347 VC killed and 1 captured against U.S. losses of 57 killed.

Porto di Po di Goro Lighthouse

Porto di Po di Goro Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located on the Isola dell'Amore on the Adriatic Sea, the northernmost place in Emilia-Romagna to the border with Veneto, on the delta of Po river.
Description.
The first lighthouse was built in 1865 near the mouth of the Po river, but the progressive fluvial deposit turned away from the sea; today this lighthouse has been recovered and used as a birdwatching observatory. The old lighthouse was replaced by another which was destroyed in 1945 from the retreating German troops. The current lighthouse was built in 1950 and consists of a 2-storey red bricks keeper's house; the tower, high, with balcony and lantern is attached to the seaward side keeper's house. The lighthouse until 1985 was painted with red and white horizontal bands and utilised as day-mark. The lantern, painted in white and the dome in grey metallic, is positioned at above sea level and emits two white flashes in a 10 seconds period, visible up to a distance of . The lighthouse is completely automated and operated by the Marina Militare with the identification code number 4072 E.F.

Diuris arenaria

Diuris arenaria, commonly known as the Tomaree donkey orchid or sand doubletail is a species of orchid which is endemic to a very small area of New South Wales. It has two grass-like leaves and up to nine mauve or light purple and white flowers. It has a very limited distribution near Newcastle.
Description.
"Diuris arenaria" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear to lance-shaped leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to nine mauve or light purple and white flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are greenish, narrow lance-shaped, long, wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other or crossed. The petals are erect or turned backwards with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped to wedge-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are narrow oblong, long and wide. There are two purple, ridge-like calli extending from the base of the labellum to its midpoint. Flowering occurs from August to September.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris arenaria" was first formally described in 1999 by David Jones from a specimen collected between Nelson Bay and Shoal Bay and the description was published in "The Orchadian". The specific epithet ("arenaria") is a Latin word meaning "sandy".
Distribution and habitat.
The Tomaree donkey orchid is only known from a small part of the Tomaree National Park where it grows in sandy soil in heathy forest.
Conservation.
"Diuris arenaria" is classed as "endangered" under the New South Wales "Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016". The main threats to the species are risk of extinction due to small distribution and population size, habitat disturbance and fragmentation, weed invasion and inappropriate fire regimes.

5th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment

The 5th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, was a unit of Britain's Territorial Force formed in 1908 from Volunteer units originally raised in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1860. It served in some of the bitterest fighting on the Western Front during World War I, including the Somme, Ypres and the German spring offensive. Before World War II it was converted to air defence, in which role it served during The Blitz and in Burma, where it employed anti-aircraft guns for 'bunker-busting'. Postwar, it continued to serve in Anti-Aircraft Command until 1955.
Precursor units.
The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need. A large number of independent RVCs were raised in the West Riding of Yorkshire, including the 'Barnsley Rifles' and the 'Rotherham Rifles' and in August 1860 some of these were grouped into the 4th Administrative Battalion, Yorkshire West Riding RVCs, based at Doncaster (dates are those of the first officers' commissions):
The 20th RVC was recruited largely from employees of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Doncaster Works and was commanded by the railway's locomotive superintendent, Archibald Sturrock. The other units in the battalion were mainly recruited from coal mining and related industries. A Rotherham Rifle Band was formed and by August 1861 it was competing in brass band competitions.
Walter Spencer-Stanhope (1827–1911) of Cannon Hall and Horsforth Hall, a captain in the 2nd West Riding Yeomanry, who had raised the 36th RVC, was appointed lieutenant-colonel commanding the 4th Admin Bn on 11 February 1863. He later became Member of Parliament for the Southern Division of the West Riding (1872–80).
A drill hall was built at Wharncliffe Street, Rotherham, in 1873, prior to which the 18th and 36th RVCs had used the Court House and Corn Exchange in the town. A drill hall was also built in Eastgate, Barnsley, in 1897.
The RVCs in the 4th Admin Bn were consolidated as the 8th Yorkshire West Riding RVC at Doncaster in 1880, still under the command of Lt-Col Stanhope:
Lieutenant-Colonel Stanhope was promoted to colonel on 1 July 1881, was awarded a CB for his Volunteer work in 1887, and received the Volunteer Decoration (VD) in 1892. He finally retired from the command in 1895 and became Honorary Colonel of the battalion. He was knighted (KCB) in 1904. and died in 1911.
Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms, the 8th was linked with the 2nd (Hallamshire) West Riding RVC, the 3rd West Yorkshire Militia and the Regular 65th (2nd Yorkshire, North Riding) and 84th (York &amp; Lancaster) Regiments into Brigade No 7 (West Riding of Yorkshire). When the 65th and 84th were amalgamated to create the York and Lancaster Regiment in 1881 as part of the Childers Reforms, the 8th West Riding RVC was formally attached to it, becoming the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, York &amp; Lancaster Regiment in 1883. An additional company was raised in 1884, and a Rotherham Cadet Corps existed from 1894 to 1899.
The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training. Under this scheme the Volunteer Battalions of the York &amp; Lancaster Regiment were included in the East Yorkshire Brigade.
Volunteers from the battalion served in a Service Company alongside the Regulars of the regiment during the Second Boer War, gaining the battalion its first Battle Honour South Africa 1900–1902.
Territorial Force.
When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the battalion was split up: the companies from Rotherham (3), Barnsley (2) and Wath-upon-Dearne became 5th Battalion, York &amp; Lancaster Regiment, while the companies from Doncaster (5) and Pontefract together with two companies from 1st VB King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI) became 5th Bn KOYLI.
The new 5th York &amp; Lancaster Bn was distributed as follows:
The two York &amp; Lancaster TF battalions, together with those of the KOYLI, formed the III West Riding Brigade in the West Riding Division.
World War I.
Mobilisation.
Towards the end of July 1914, the units of the West Riding Division left their headquarters for their annual training camps, but on 3 and 4 August they were ordered to return; on 4 August immediate mobilisation was ordered. The 5th York &amp; Lancasters mobilised at Rotherham under the command of Lt-Col C. Fox, TD, who had been CO since 1 April 1914.
Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and the majority of the battalion did so. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix while the parent unit took '1/'. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right, and 3rd Line or Reserve units were formed.
1/5th Battalion.
After mobilisation, the 1st West Riding Division concentrated in the South Yorkshire area, and began training for war. On 31 March it was informed that it had been selected to proceed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and the battalion landed at Boulogne on 14 April. On 18–19 April platoons from the III West Riding Bde were attached to 8th Division for training in the routine of trench duties. On 28 April the West Riding Division took over its own section of the line at Fleurbaix. It now formed part of IV Corps, which attacked at the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May. While the other two divisions of IV Corps made the actual attack, the West Riding Division took over the greater part of the corps' trench line. It was supposed to follow up and occupy the captured enemy line, but the breakthrough did not occur.
On 12 May the division was designated 49th (West Riding) Division and the brigade became 148th (3rd West Riding).
For the next nine months the 49th Division took part in no major operations but was almost continuously engaged in day-to-day trench warfare, much of it in the Ypres Salient, with the considerable casualties that this entailed. On 19 December the division received a sudden attack with the new German phosgene gas, followed by heavy shelling, but no serious infantry attack followed. In January 1916 the division was withdrawn for its first period of complete rest since it first entered the line.
Somme.
At the beginning of February the battalion machine gunners left to join 148 Brigade Machine Gun Company. That month the division moved to the Somme sector, 1/5th York &amp; Lancasters under Lt-Col Shuttleworth Rendell proceeding to Oissy. Here the division spent the next few months alternating trench duties with working parties and training for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. For this the 49th Division formed the reserve for X Corps, which was tasked with seizing the Thiepval Spur, after which the 49th was to pass through and continue the pursuit. The 1/5th York &amp; Lancasters moved up to assembly trenches in Aveluy Wood before dawn on the day of the attack (1 July), and at 13.30 moved up to the British front trenches alongside the River Ancre, Lt-Col Rendell taking C and D Companies to the south while Major Shaw took A and B Companies to the north. The battalion attempted to assist 108 Bde of the 36th (Ulster) Division, which had made good progress but had become cut off. After the failure of the first day, the York &amp; Lancasters spent the next week in confused fighting along the Ancre. On 6 July, the battalion sent forward two bombing parties totalling seven officers and 80 other ranks to capture a trench: of these only 22 other ranks returned, the CO, Lt-Col Rendell, being left behind wounded in a German dugout, and Maj Shaw killed. By the time the battalion was relieved at 20.30 on 8 July it had suffered a total of 307 casualties.
By 14 July the British had taken the Leipzig Redoubt on the Thiepval Spur, and while the offensive continued 49th Division remained holding this area, with a number of small actions and suffering a good deal of shelling, at the same time preparing trenches and dumps for a renewed attack. This attack was made on 3 September, at the end of the Battle of Pozières, but 5th York &amp; Lancasters was not directly involved in the failed action. 49th Division continued minor operations towards Thiepval during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15–22 September) before the offensive petered out.
Ypres.
During the summer of 1917 the 49th Division was earmarked for operations along the Flanders coast that failed to materialise. In October it was moved to the Ypres sector to join the Third Ypres Offensive. It took part in the Battle of Poelcapelle on 9 October, with 148 Bde on the left and 146 (1st West Yorkshire) Bde in the centre of the attack. The troops had a long night approach march in rain across appalling ground under shellfire, and only just reached the jumping-off tapes in time for Zero. When the attack went in at 05.20, the rain stopped so that the German defenders had perfect visibility. 148 Brigade was immediately stopped by a flooded stream, leaving 146 Bde to advance alone. They managed a few hundred yards before being stopped by a broad belt of undamaged German barbed wire. The division was now pinned down under fire from artillery, riflemen hidden in shell craters, and from machine guns in German pillboxes on the higher ground ahead. Although some of these pillboxes were taken, the division's attacking troops were back at their start line by the afternoon, having suffered heavy casualties.
Spring Offensive.
Once 2/5th Bn York &amp; Lancasters was disbanded at the end of January 1918 ("see below"), the 1/5th became simply '5th Bn' once more. 49th Division remained in the Ypres area during the winter of 1917–18 and was therefore not involved in the first stage of the German spring offensive. However, when the second phase (Operation Georgette, or the Battle of the Lys) began on 9 April, it soon began to put pressure on the southern part of the Ypres Salient. Brigade groups from 49th Division were sent south to support other British formations. On 10 April it was the turn of 148 Bde, which moved to Neuve Eglise; that night 5th York &amp; Lancasters was attached to 74 Bde of 25th Division fighting near Steenwerck, south of Nieppe (the Battle of Estaires). The battalion carried out a 'dashing' attack on Cabaret du Saule on 11 April. It remained attached to 74 Bde through the Battle of Bailleul, fighting stubbornly on the Mont De Lille on 14 April, until relieved on 16 April, earning the praise of 74 Bde's commander.
After a five-day pause, the German offensive was renewed on 25 April. 5th York &amp; Lancasters was with 148 Bde in corps reserve at Poperinghe and was not involved in the action at Mont Kemmel when the German "Alpenkorps" seized the dominating hill (the Second Battle of Kemmel Ridge). However, the Germans were unable to follow up this success and over the next three days 148 Bde was able to improvise a line behind the ridge, pushing Lewis gun teams well forward to command the valley. When the Germans attacked on 29 April (the Battle of the Scherpenberg), they were stopped dead by rifle and machine gun fire.
Hundred Days Offensive.
The battalion returned to the fighting during the Allied Hundred Days Offensive. During the pursuit to the River Selle, 49th Division was ordered to attack on 12 October, but patrols found that the enemy had disappeared, so the barrage was cancelled and zero hour was brought forward. The division established a line along the edge of the high ground overlooking the Selle, the opposite bank of which was strongly held. However, when 147 (2nd West Riding) and 148 Bdes went forward next morning they were observed and suffered severely from a German barrage and fire from machine guns across the river that had been missed by the British barrage. They made little progress and were eventually withdrawn to a position only slightly ahead of their starting line. However, the division seized Saulzoir and established small bridgeheads over the Selle on the night on 14/15 October.
After the BEF had forced the river line (the Battle of the Selle), there was a pause before the next bound of the pursuit. On the night of 1/2 November 148 Bde returned to the line in front of Valenciennes. Its task was to seize the defended steelworks, which had repulsed the rest of the division the day before. The attack (the Battle of Valenciennes) went in at 05.30 and was successful, though the steelworks was not secured until 16.00. On 3 November the brigade went forward again under the command of 56th (1st London) Division, meeting no opposition as they pursued the defeated enemy.
The division was relieved after this attack, and its infantry was still resting near Douai when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November. Demobilisation began in January 1919 and was virtually complete by the end of March. The 5th York &amp; Lancasters was disembodied on 20 June 1919.
2/5th Battalion.
The 2/5th Bn York &amp; Lancasters was formed at Rotherham on 3 October 1914. and became part of the 2/3rd West Riding Bde in the 2nd West Riding Division. These were later numbered 187 Bde and 62nd Division respectively.
Until April 1915 they had no weapons with to train. Some Lee-Enfield rifles were then received, but these were withdrawn in May, and until the beginning of 1916 the 2nd Line Territorials had to make do with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles, keeping their ammunition in their pockets until 1914 pattern webbing equipment arrived. With these antiquated weapons the 62nd Division was under orders to move at short notice to defend the East Coast, for which railway trains were kept in readiness. Training was also disrupted by the frequent calls to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1st line serving on the Western Front. In May 1915 the Home Service men of 187 Bde were withdrawn to form 26th Provisional Battalion serving in coast defence in North East England. In October, the division's 2nd Line battalions were reduced to 600 all ranks, the unfit men being posted to the 26th Provisional Bn and the surplus to the 3rd Line, which became the draft-finding unit.
In May 1915 the division moved into camp in 'The Dukeries' area of Nottinghamshire, where it trained until October, when it concentrated round Retford. It then went into the Tyne defences where it dug an entrenched defence line in December. It moved to Larkhill Camp on Salisbury Plain for battle training in January 1916 and finally received SMLE Mk III rifles and Lewis guns, but in June it was sent to the East Coast defences once more, where it was scattered round East Anglia. Here battle training was less convenient and it was again called upon to provide drafts to the Western Front. In October it moved inland to Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire.
Finally, in October 1916, orders were received to bring the division up to full establishment and prepare for overseas service. Embarkation began at Southampton on 5 January 1917, and the division completed its concentration in France on 18 January. It took its place in the line in the Somme sector opposite Serre. Shortly afterwards, the German army began a planned retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) and from 15 February to 19 March the division's units were engaged in patrol work and stiff actions against rearguards while advancing across the devastated (and booby-trapped) ground until that line was reached. The division was then shifted to the line opposite Bullecourt in the southern part of the Arras sector.
Bullecourt.
Part of 62nd Division was involved in the failed first attack at Bullecourt on 11 April and in repulsing the German counter-attack at Lagnicourt on 15 April, but 187 Bde was not engaged in major action until the main Battle of Bullecourt opened on 3 May. The division spent the preceding 17 days in rehearsals and the whole division attacked in waves behind tanks and a heavy barrage, with 187 Brigade on the left. The first wave advanced at 03.37 (eight minutes before Zero) to cross of No man's land. They reached the first German line but had lost cohesion before they reached the second. Brigade HQ ordered a second attack in two waves, but this 'ended miserably in shell-holes' and at about 16.00 the division withdrew to a railway embankment where it was relieved. It was not until 17 May that the division finally cleared the village, and operations against the Hindenburg Line continued until 28 May.
After rest and reorganisation, 62nd Division returned to the line in June and began a period of several months of trench-holding.
Cambrai.
62nd Division moved into hutments at Beaulencourt in October 1917, where it trained for open warfare in preparation for the forthcoming Battle of Cambrai, including training with the Tank Corps at Wailly. On the night of 17/18 November 187 Bde took up its positions in Havrincourt Wood.
The surprise attack was launched at dawn on 20 November, with no preceding bombardment; the artillery crashed down on its targets at zero hour. The brigade advanced with Mark IV tanks of G Battalion and a company of I BattalionTank Corps towards its first objective, Havrincourt village. Despite galling fire from Havrincourt Chateau, the KOYLI battalions and tanks took the village by 08.30. Shortly afterwards the second wave of York &amp; Lancasters and supporting tanks passed through, with 2/5th as the right-hand battalion, moving north across the communication trenches between the Hindenburg line and the German support line and meeting little resistance. Within two hours the battalion had secured the second objective at the cost of fewer than 80 casualties. By 11.30 the British had taken almost the whole of the Hindenburg Main and Support Lines over the frontage of the attack. 186th (2/2nd West Riding) Brigade then passed through to the next objective at Graincourt. Further progress was held up by the failure of 51st (Highland) Division to take Flesquières, leaving 62nd Division's right flank uncovered.
The divisional objective for the second day of the attack (21 November) was Bourlon Wood, led by 186 Bde with 185 (2/1st West Riding) Bde in close support and 187 Bde in reserve. However, there were fewer tanks available and progress was slower than on the first day. Anneux was taken but Bourlon Wood remained out of reach. At dawn on 22 November, a heavy barrage and counter-attack hit the leading units of the division and a company of 2/5th York &amp; Lancasters was sent forward to help restore the situation. This fighting ended any further advances. 62nd Division was relieved by 40th Division in a tricky operation that night.
The division was back in Bourlon Wood on 27 November for another attempt to complete its capture. 187 Brigade led on the left at 06.20 with 16 of the remaining tanks to take Bourlon Village. It was dark and snowing: by 10.00 the attack had failed and the brigade had been driven out of Bourlon. It was relieved at the end of the day. The division had however succeeded in taking the last of Bourlon Ridge, which had been fought over for a week. The exhausted West Riding division was then relieved (under a hail of German gas shells) before the German counter-attack took back all the hard-won ground a few days later.
Disbandment.
By the beginning of 1918 the BEF was suffering a manpower crisis and the decision was made to break up one battalion in each infantry brigade. 2/5th York &amp; Lancasters was selected and on 3 February its men were drafted as reinforcements to the 1/4th and 1/5th Bns York &amp; Lancasters in 49th Division, and 2/4th Bn in 187 Bde.
3/5th Battalion.
The 3/5th Bn was formed at Strensall on 25 March 1915 and then moved to Clipstone Camp in Nottinghamshire where its role was to train drafts for the 1st ad 2nd Line battalions. On 8 April it was renamed the 5th Reserve Bn York &amp; Lancasters and on 1 September it was absorbed by the 4th Reserve Bn.
26th Provisional Battalion.
In 1915 the Home Service men of the 5th York &amp; Lancasters, together with those of several other West Riding TF battalions, were combined into the 26th Provisional Battalion at York, which served in home defence with 2nd Provisional Brigade. It appears to have been disbanded before the Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit.
Interwar.
TF units reformed on 1 February 1920 and the following year the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army. 5th Battalion York &amp; Lancasters were once again in 148th (3rd West Riding) Bde of 49th (West Riding) Division.
Anti-Aircraft conversion.
During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units. The 5th York &amp; Lancasters was one of the battalions selected, becoming 67th (The York &amp; Lancaster Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery on 10 December 1936 and completing the conversion by December 1937. It consisted of HQ Battery with 187th, 188th and 189th AA Batteries and 67 Machine Gun Battery at Rotherham and formed part of 31st (North Midland) AA Group in 2 AA Division. 67 Machine Gun Bty was converted into 198 AA Bty on 1 May 1937. When Royal Artillery (RA) gun brigades were redesignated as regiments on 1 January 1939, the AA groups were redesignated as brigades. 31 AA Brigade transferred to the newly formed 7 AA Division during 1939.
World War II.
Mobilisation.
The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.
On mobilisation, 67th AA Rgt deployed in the Sheffield Gun Zone as part of 39 AA Bde in 7 AA Division (shortly afterwards reverting to 2 AA Division), with 23 heavy AA guns deployed. The brigade already referred to its AA gun regiments (equipped with 3-inch, 3.7-inch or 4.5-inch guns) as HAA (to distinguish them from the newer light AA or LAA units that were being formed); this became official across the Royal Artillery on 1 June 1940. However, due to the shortage of equipment at this stage of the war, HAA units sometimes had to provide Lewis gun Light machine gun (LMG) detachments in the LAA role to defend Vital Points (VPs). On 17 September 67th HAA Rgt temporarily took over the VPs at Orgreave, South Yorkshire, and by early 1940 was also manning sites at Thorncliffe, West Yorkshire, Chesterfield and elsewhere. At the beginning of March 1940 the brigade's first Gun-laying Mk I radar set became operational in the Sheffield Gun Zone.
Battle of Britain and Blitz.
Incursions by "Luftwaffe" aircraft over the Humber Estuary became more frequent in May and June 1940. By the end of June 67th HAA Rgt had given up responsibility for VPs, and due to rotation of batteries 198 HAA Bty was under 62nd (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt in the Humber Gun Zone, while Regimental HQ was commanding its own 187 and 189 HAA Btys, and 173 HAA Bty from 62nd HAA Rgt, with a total of 23 HAA guns. In July it was also joined by 'D' Bty Royal Marines. As the Battle of Britain got under way, night intruders appeared over the Sheffield Gun Zone and were fired upon without effect.
When the night Blitz began over London in September, the gunners of 188 and later 189 HAA Btys were loaned to 1 AA Division to man guns covering the London Inner Artillery Zone, while 270 and two Troops of 286 HAA Bty from 91st HAA Rgt in the Humber Gun Zone arrived to augment 67th HAA Rgt at Sheffield. The CO of 67th HAA Rgt was acting as AA Defence Commander (AADC), Sheffield Gun Zone, with his HQ at the drill hall at Rotherham. During November, AA Command scraped together a further 16 mobile 3.7-inch guns for Sheffield, to be manned by various batteries under the AADC.
Sheffield and Rotherham were badly bombed on the night of 12/13 December (the start of the Sheffield Blitz), with continuous raids from the east and south between 18.00 and 04.00, These began with incendiary bombs to mark the targets, followed by high explosive bombs. The Humber guns engaged some of the raiders on their way to the target, and the Sheffield guns fired over 3700 rounds; two aircraft were claimed as shot down. Apart from a couple of bombs on an English Steel Company works there was little damage to industry, but there were around 400 civilian casualties, about 100 of them fatal. The bombers returned with incendiary bombs on 15/16 December.
188 HAA Battery returned from detachment after the first raid, and the inexperienced 117th HAA Rgt arrived in January and had been trained on the gunsites by experienced gunners. There was some further bombing in the Sheffield area on the nights of 9/10 and 15/16 January, though the actual targets of these raids were Manchester and Humberside respectively.
The regiment sent a cadre to 209th Training Regiment at Blandford Camp to provide the basis for a new 387 Bty; this was formed on 14 November 1940 and later joined 121st HAA Rgt
On 8 February 1941, 67th HAA Rgt transferred to 50 Light AA Bde covering Derby and Nottingham. The "Luftwaffe" attempted to bomb Derby on the night of 8/9 May, but most crews attacked Nottingham in error, leading to the Nottingham Blitz – one of the last significant raids of the "Luftwaffe's" Blitz campaign. By this stage 50 LAA Bde was concentrating on LAA guns and searchlights, and 67th HAA Rgt had transferred to a new 66 AA Bde controlling the HAA guns.
Overseas.
67th HAA Regiment left AA Command in July 1941 and joined the War Office Reserve preparatory to going overseas. The establishment for overseas regiments was only three batteries, so 198 HAA Bty remained in the UK and on 14 September joined a new 136th HAA Rgt. This regiment never went overseas and was disbanded in 1946.
67th HAA Regiment embarked as part of the reinforcements for the British forces in Egypt, arriving on 23 December under the command of Lt-Col H.H.M. Oliver. However, it only stayed a month: the rapid progress of the Japanese invasion of Malaya begun on 7/8 December meant that reinforcements were urgently needed for India and 67th HAA Rgt was among the units re-embarked. It landed at Bombay on 1 February 1942.
Burma.
On arrival, 67th HAA Rgt immediately moved to Calcutta, where it came under 1 Indian AA Bde, which was responsible for the air defence of the industrial areas and airfields of the city. Shortly afterwards it moved up the Manipur Road under the newly arrived 9 AA Bde that took responsibility for the Assam/Burma frontier.
As the Japanese advanced though Burma, they began air raids against Allied airfields and facilities in Assam from October 1942, and these progressed to South-East Bengal, Chittagong and Calcutta itself by December. 9 AA Brigade deployed batteries of 8 HAA guns at each of 15 airfields, as well as defending key supply points for the First Arakan offensive. 187 HAA Bty was detached with IV Corps.
After the failure of the Arakan offensive there was a pause during the Monsoon. Then in October the newly created Fourteenth Army moved forward again, with 67th HAA Rgt (less 189 HAA Bty, which remained with 9 AA Bde until late November 1943) moving up to the Imphal area under IV Corps.
Battle of Imphal.
In early 1944, the Japanese launched Operation U-Go to forestall the Allied advance. Fourteenth Army based its defences on the Imphal Plain, with IV Corps well forward. As Corps HAA regiment, 67th HAA Rgt was deployed to defend the airfields around Imphal. When the Japanese attacks swept round these vital airfields they became the centres of defended localities, and the regiment's guns provided Counter-battery fire and defensive fire, as well as AA defence. By June, when the Kohima–Imphal road was reopened, the regiment claimed 13 'kills' from 839 AA rounds fired, but had already fired over 5000 rounds on ground targets in the Battle of Imphal. XXXIII Indian Corps now took over the lead, 67th HAA Rgt being relieved of its AA duties and transferring to this corps in the medium artillery role. It used field-gun fuzes for its ammunition for 'bunker-busting' as the Japanese were evicted from their positions in the Manipur hills.
Advance to Tiddim.
5th Indian Division continued to advance on Tiddim during the Monsoon rains. 67th HAA Regiment forced its way along the Tiddim road in support, mostly shooting at ground targets, but also providing working parties and vehicles to help the advance, 'its great Matador gun tractors skidding and winching their way along tracks with their 3.7-inch HAA guns'. It helped to reduce the enemy garrison at Tiddim with accurate long-range ground fire and then 'climbed the high ground of the Kennedy Peak feature with 5th Indian Division, no easy task as tracks had to be bulldozed to take heavy vehicles, the steep slopes required vehicles and guns to be winched up them and enemy bunkers had to be blasted clear by concentrated fire. Supplies of all kinds, including AA ammunition, were delivered by air to maintain the advance'. Tiddim fell on 17 October and Kennedy Peak was captured in early November.
As the next phase of operations (Operation Extended Capital) was being prepared, 67th HAA Rgt reverted to being an infantry unit, handing over all its equipment to 1st West African HAA Rgt. However, in December a detachment of 187 HAA Bty returned to Imphal and took over two of the recently arrived 7.2-inch howitzers, which were to be used for 'bunker-busting' on IV Corps' front. The howitzer detachment left Imphal on 24 December and moved up via Tamu and the Kabaw Valley into the Irrawaddy bridgehead at Pagan.
Moving these heavy guns through the jungle and Paddy fields into firing positions took enormous labour, and often required extra recovery vehicles and bulldozers. Sergeant E. Parnell of 187 HAA Bty recalled that normally the howitzers went forward at first light to join the infantry, who would identify the target, usually a bunker. This would be engaged over open sights, sometimes after an air strike or field guns had blown away any camouflage to reveal the target. On one occasion the detachment cooperated with a Stinson L-5 Sentinel Air Observation Post aircraft to obtain a direct hit on a Japanese 155mm gun hidden under a building on stilts at Chauk. During these engagements there was pressure to achieve early hits and to couple the gun up to its tractor and withdraw before the Japanese retaliated with mortar fire.
Meiktila.
In January 1945 the rest of the regiment resumed its AA role with 16 x 3.7-inch HAA guns and moved up from Imphal to rejoin IV Corps at the Irrawaddy. The guns and GL radar trailers covered , often having to be 'double tractored' and winched up gradients of 1 in 5. 187 HAA Battery was deployed to defend Sinthe airfield as soon as it was captured, 188 HAA Bty covered the river crossings at Myitche, and 189 HAA Bty was detached to 17th Indian Division across the Irrawaddy at Pauk and went speeding on with it to Meiktila to cut off the Japanese force in Mandalay. As it covered the route, the motorised striking force was dependent on air supply. Meiktila airfield was captured on 24 February, and 189 HAA Bty deployed to protect it. The battery came under repeated air and ground attacks and was frequently mortared and shelled before the Capture of Meiktila was completed on 4 March. After Meiktila, Fourteenth Army was able to advance on Mandalay, which fell on 21 March.
On 20 March the regiment handed its 7.2-inch howitzers over to 52nd (London) HAA Rgt, which replaced 67th in IV Corps. At the end of April the regiment was at Myingyan under Fourteenth Army, and in May it came under the command of 24 AA Bde, which took over air defence in the Meiktila area. However, with the Monsoon rains approaching, the policy of Allied Land Forces South East Asia was to send long-serving British units back to India and replace them with Indian units. On 17 May, 67th HAA Rgt was flown back to India, although a cadre of the regiment arrived in Rangoon on 13 June after its capture the previous month.
The Surrender of Japan came in August 1945, and the regiment with its three batteries was placed in suspended animation in India between 31 October 1945 and 1 February 1946.
Postwar.
When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment reformed at Rotherham as 467 (The York &amp; Lancaster Regiment) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, ('Mixed' indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit). It formed part of 65 AA Bde (the former 39 AA Bde) at Doncaster.
When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, there was a reduction in the number of AA units in the TA. 467 HAA Regiment merged into 271 (Sheffield) Field Rgt, becoming 'R' (5th York &amp; Lancaster) Bty. On 1 May 1961, R Bty amalgamated with 865 Locating Bty, RA, and reverted to infantry as B (Barnsley) Company of the Hallamshire Battalion, York &amp; Lancaster Rgt.
Honorary Colonel.
The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the battalion:
Uniforms and insignia.
The uniform of the 8th Yorkshire West Riding RVC was scarlet with green facings. The 2nd VB adopted the white facings of the York &amp; Lancaster Regiment.
When the 5th Bn was converted to artillery in 1936, all ranks continued to wear York &amp; Lancaster Rgt cap badges with RA collar badges and shoulder titles. The cap badges were replaced by RA badges in 1940.
During World War II 67th HAA Rgt is believed to have worn a regimental flash consisting of a flaming grenade badge embroidered in yellow on a green over blue diamond with the colours separated by a thin yellow horizontal line.

Lucifer Rising (Bobby Beausoleil soundtrack)

Lucifer Rising is an album composed and recorded by Bobby Beausoleil and his band, The Freedom Orchestra, which consisted of inmates from Deuel Vocational Institution also known as Tracy Prison. The album is the soundtrack to the 1972 film "Lucifer Rising," a film directed by avant-garde film director and mystic Kenneth Anger. The soundtrack album was initially released on vinyl LP in 1981, and has since been reissued six times in both CD and LP formats. 
Creation.
The Lucifer Rising film project had its genesis in 1956 when Kenneth Anger conceived of making a film that would be antithetical to his previous film, "Scorpio Rising", a dark film exploring death image fixations in the outlaw motorcycle culture. In contrast, the filmmaker wanted his new film to be a celebration of a rebellious "bringer of light" themed imagery. 
In early 1967, Anger attended The Invisible Circus, an erotic-themed counterculture event held at Glide Memorial Church, where Bobby Beausoleil was performing with his band, The Orkustra. Impressed by Beausoleil's performance, Anger approached him about playing the starring role in his new film. After some discussion, Beausoleil agreed on the condition that he would create the soundtrack for the project. They worked on the film project together through the summer of that year but the collaboration fell apart in the fall, coinciding with the rapid disintegration of the counterculture scene in San Francisco.
In 1972, Kenneth Anger approached Jimmy Page of the rock band Led Zeppelin with a proposal to compose the soundtrack for his resurrected film project, "Lucifer Rising". Anger announced in a 1972 interview with "Variety" magazine, that Page would be composing the soundtrack and also stated that the film was near completion. He also (erroneously) claimed that Page was involved in the creation of the film itself.
Composition for the album was halted when Anger, following a dispute with Page's wife Charlotte, was thrown out of the basement of Page's London mansion. Page had previously allowed Anger to reside in the basement for at least the duration of the film's production, although the particulars of the arrangement are unclear. Nevertheless, following his eviction, Anger began to criticize Page and his wife in the press. Anger said, "I'm beginning to think Jimmy has dried up as a musician. He has got no themes, no inspiration, no melodies to offer."
After learning of Page's exit from the production of the soundtrack, state prisoner Bobby Beausoleil wrote to Anger from Tracy Prison (also known as Deuel Vocational Institution) in San Joaquin County, California. Beausoleil suggested that he should compose the soundtrack for Lucifer Rising, as the two had originally agreed a decade earlier. He told Anger that be believed he could obtain approval from the prison administration to record his compositions within the institution. Anger provided a modest $3,000 for the purchase of recording equipment.
Beausoleil enlisted the sponsorship of Minerva Bertholf, a teacher at the prison, to facilitate the purchase of recording equipment. Permission to proceed with the project was granted by the Warden. Beausoleil formed the Freedom Orchestra with fellow inmates, and recorded the album in the prison using instruments built in the prison handicraft shop. Anger was enthusiastic about the project, and he would occasionally visit Tracy Prison to discuss the project with Beausoleil.
Following the debut of the film with its soundtrack in 1980, the 44-minute soundtrack to Lucifer Rising was released on vinyl LP in 1981 by Lethal Records. Most of the initial copies were sold by Anger at the screenings of his film. In 2005, the soundtrack was reissued by Beausoleil with additional outtakes from the 1967 iteration of the Lucifer Rising soundtrack in a two-disk CD package on the Arcanum label. In 2009, Beausoleil released a 4-LP anthology comprising all of the project recordings that were made during the creation of the "Lucifer Rising" soundtrack entitled "The Lucifer Rising Suite", on The Ajna Offensive label. A CD version of The Lucifer Rising Suite was released in 2014. In 2017, Bobby Beausoleil, again in collaboration with The Ajna Offensive, released a commemorative reissue of the original soundtrack as a continuous mix on Vinyl LP and Limited Edition CD.
Theme.
The music of "Lucifer Rising" is closely linked with the occult elements found in Anger's film of the same name. Beausoleil sought to draw on his own mystic life experiences to tell the story of "mythical Lucifer awakening in his pit of despair, rekindling his torch, and rising like a phoenix from the ashes of his own unmaking to begin his long journey from the dark recesses of the underworld — shedding his pride along the way in his uncompromising desire to regain the Beloved." Beausoleil sought to do this by creating dark and sinister sounding music that gradually evolves to a brighter and more uplifting finale. "Lucifer Rising" is primarily instrumental rock with an otherworldly orchestral feel.
Reception.
Critic J. Scott McClintock gave the soundtrack album 4.5 stars out of a possible 5 for Allmusic.com. Trying to judge the music on its own merits apart from Bobby Beausoleil's criminal history, McClintock wrote that he was "a talented arranger and a fine guitarist", creating music reminiscent of both early Pink Floyd and composer Claude Debussy.

Buchan, Queensland

Buchan is a coastal town in the locality of Palm Cove in the Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia.
Geography.
Buchan is a coastal town with sandy beaches north and south of Buchan Point. The Captain Cook Highway passes through the town.
History.
The town name is derived from Mount Buchan, named on 20 October 1873 by explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple, after one of the districts of his native Aberdeenshire in Scotland.
In the 1880s, there was a coconut palm plantation with over 600 trees owned by James Jamieson known as the Mount Buchan Estate. It was predicted to become a popular seaside retreat for the people of Cairns. The palm trees along the beach areas gave it the nickname Palm Beach but, as that caused confusion with other places officially known as Palm Beach, it acquired the name Palm Cove, which is now the official name for the locality (although the town itself remains gazetted as Buchan).
In April 1933, a number of families were living at Buchan Point while the men were working on the road from Cairns to Port Douglas (now the Captain Cook Highway). The families asked the Queensland Government to provide a school. Buchan Point State School opened on 1933 and in December 1933 the students enjoyed a "breaking up" party at Hartley's Creek. Buchan Point State School No 850 opened on 1933he school closed in February 1934.

Tedua

Mario Molinari (born 21 February 1994), known professionally as Tedua, is an Italian rapper and actor.
Initially also known as Duate, Tedua is known as one of the members of the collective Wild Bandana, along with Izi, Vaz Té, Sangue and Ill Rave.
Biography.
Tedua, pseudonym of Mario Molinari, was born in Genoa. At the age of three he was entrusted to a family, with whom the young Mario stayed for a very short span of time. He later spent a few years with his maternal grandmother in Milan, before returning in his teens in the town of Cogoleto, in the suburbs of Genoa, where he grew up coming into contact with those who will then be members of "Wild Bandana". Aged 13 Mario met Vaz Tè at school, through whom he will meet Izi. The three, who will then be joined by other boys, will begin to devote themselves to musical activity, giving themselves soon stage names: Molinari chose "Incubo" ("Nightmare"), name which he later dropped in favor of "Duate".
Musical style.
The musical style of Tedua approaches essentially to the drill. From this point of view, the critics haven't been unanimous regarding the style of Tedua, expressing sometimes satisfaction, sometimes disapproval of the artistic innovation of the rapper. Drill sounds, however, respond to the flow of consciousness that underlies the music of Tedua, which is always a verbal expression of thoughts and experiences of life.
Tedua has often claimed to have been stylistically inspired by the Italian rapper Dargen D'Amico, from whom he inherited the vision of music as a stream of consciousness: not surprisingly, in the "Mowgli" disc is contained a piece, "Acqua (malpensandoti)", whose refrain is a resumption of D'Amico's "Malpensandoti".
In addition to the Milanese rapper, Tedua's sources of inspiration include Chief Keef and Fedez.

Indonesian National Air Defense Forces Command

The Indonesian National Air Defense Forces Command (Komando Pertahanan Udara Nasional TNI /Kohanudnas TNI) is one of the Major Operational Commands of the Indonesian National Armed Forces that is responsible for air surveillance, early warning system and air defense of Indonesian airspace. Kohanudnas plays a vital part for air defense capability of the Republic of Indonesia. Kohanudnas report directly to National Armed Forces HQ, and not part of Indonesian Air Force although most of its personnel are picked from the Air Force.
History.
At the early of 1962, Operation Trikora was getting underway as the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) were already engaging the military forces of The Netherlands in what is now Papua and West Papua provinces. The National Air Defense Forces Command was established on 9 February 1962 as the air defense division of that operation commanded by AVM H.M.Sujono on the basis of the "TNI Joint Service Air Defense Command" ("Komando Pertahanan Udara Gabungan APRI") whose commander for Papuan air force operations was Colonel Leo Wattimena of the Air Force. At the beginning, the INADF was organized into 2 Air defense sectors covering parts of the Moluccas and the then Netherlands New Guinea, each composed of a number of radar stations. By March 1962, four Air Defense Sectors were active nationwide.
After the conclusion of Operation Trikora, the command was the first to be equipped with surface to air missiles in Southeast Asia, with the arrival of the S-75 Dvina SAM system, which served alongside the AZP S-60, M1939 61-K, M1939 52-K, Zastava M55, Bofors 40 mm gun and the Oerlikon GDF until the early 1970s, alongside radar stations built with Warsaw Pact and Yugoslav assistance. 
The Air Force Air Defense Command, raised on 12 September 1963, form majority of the personnel under the Kohanudnas. Its primary mission is to develop and prepare combat readiness of air defense capabilities of the air force. The Air Defense Command is based at Halim Perdanakusuma Airport and has 4 air defense wings, which are 100th Missile Defense Wing, 200th Radar Wing, 300th Interceptor Wing, and 400th Radar Wing. Aside from these, personnel of the Army Air Defense Artillery Corps and the Directorate of Air Defense Operations of the Navy, both of the Indonesian Army and Indonesian Navy, respectively and activated in 1962, are under its operational supervision.

Notable events.
Bawean Incident.
In July 2003, Kohanudnas detected unauthorized military aircraft flying over Bawean Island off the eastern coast of Java for more than two hours, and ordered the Indonesian Air Force to scrambled two fully armed F-16s to intercept the unauthorized aircraft, which were five US Navy F/A-18 Hornets . The incident ended peacefully through a "Friend or Foe" hand signal. A US spokesman said that the naval aircraft had sought permission to enter Indonesian airspace while escorting a US aircraft carrier, but that the request arrived too late at the Kohanudnas headquarters in Jakarta due to red tape.
Pakistan International Airlines Incident.
Pakistan International Airlines's Boeing 737-300 was detected entering Indonesian airspace without diplomatic clearance on 7 March 2011. Kohanudnas then ordered the Air Force to scramble a pair of Sukhoi to intercept and force the aircraft to land at Hasanuddin airport.
Papua New Guinea Aircraft Incident.
On 29 November 2011, Syamsudin Noor Airport's radar detected Dassault Falcon 900 EX that carried Papua New Guinean Deputy Prime Minister H.O.N. Belden Namah entering Indonesian airspace, then the airport's ATC and Kohanudnas tries to contact the aircraft as it is an unscheduled flight, but no response. As Kohanudnas also didn't authorize aircraft flight clearance, they decide to scramble two Sukhoi fighter to intercept and shadowing the Falcon near Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan, for about 37 minutes. It was found that Falcon was applied for flight clearance shortly before take-off and the clearance was not granted yet during the incident. The minister of foreign affairs of Indonesia said that Kohanudnas was conducting an electronic identification with radar and a visual identification by intercepting (the aircraft) according to standard procedures, and no harm occurred.

Einstein's Sink

Einstein's Sink is an antique sink that has been in use by the physics faculty of Leiden University since 1920. Originally the sink stood in the large lecture room of the old Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory. It was taken to the new building when the physicists moved to the Leiden Bioscience park in 1977. Here it still stands in the current large lecture room (The De Sitterzaal of the J.H. Oortgebouw), continuing the tradition of washing the hands of visiting famous scientists. A short list of 'sink users' consists out of Paul Ehrenfest, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Albert Einstein. But also more recently nobel prize winners like Brian Schmidt and Albert Fert.
In 2015 plans were announced for a new science campus which will replace the current one in 2025. After some inquiries it was clear that the faculty board had no plans of moving the sink once more to the upcoming physics department and therefore a petition was started to 'save the sink'. Because of this the sink appeared in local and national media several times. The petition got 197 autographs within one month and was later presented to the faculty board. The science faculty accepted the petition and moved the sink to the De Sitter lecture room in the new Oort building, where it can keep serving the physicists like it did years before.

27 July 1996 incident

The 27 July Incident was an attack by Indonesian government forces on the head office of the Indonesian Democratic Party, which was being occupied by supporters of recently ousted party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri. It was followed by two days of riots in Jakarta.
Background.
After coming to power, the New Order regime of President Suharto took steps to consolidate its position, firstly turning the Golkar organization into the regime's political vehicle, then in 1973 pressuring the nine parties who had been allowed to contest the 1971 elections to merge into just two. The Islamic parties joined together to form the United Development Party (PPP), while the nationalist and Christian parties fused into the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI). Only these three organizations were allowed to contest the five-yearly elections, and Golkar always won a significant majority of the votes, partly because of government threats and intimidation.
In the 1987 elections, Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno agreed to stand for election and campaign for the PDI. She repeatedly invoked her father's name at election rallies, and the positive response to this from young voters was a shock for the government. She was elected, and took her seat in the People's Representative Council in October 1987. In the 1992 election campaign, the PDI called for significant reforms, including a two-term limit for the president, which prompted a direct response from President Suharto, who said such a call was an attack on the Constitution. The PDI garnered its highest ever vote, 14.9 percent due to its criticism of the government and use of Sukarno as a symbol. This increased share of the vote seemed to be mostly at the expense of Golkar. After repeated government interference in PDI leadership contests, Megawati became party chair in December 1993.
By 1996, support for the PDI was increasing among intellectuals, middle class city-dwellers and low income Jakartans. Some of Megawati's supporters urged her to run for the presidency. The Indonesian military subsequently intervened in an extraordinary PDI conference held in Medan from 20–24 June to depose Megawati, and reappoint former leader Soerjadi, who was seen as less of a threat. On 20 June, 5,000 people attended a demonstration in support of Megawati in Jakarta – some wearing "Megawati for President" t-shirts. Over 70 were injured in clashes with police and soldiers. In Medan, Soerjadi was duly elected party chair, but Megawati and her followers refused to recognize this, and launched a legal challenge. The PDI split into two factions, the government-recognized PDI led by Soerjadi recognized by the government, and the "PDI Mega" supported by the by grassroots membership.
Attack on PDI headquarters.
Following the Medan congress, Megawati's supporters refused to leave the party head office on Jalan Diponegoro, Menteng, Jakarta. They played music and listened to speeches attacking corruption in the government. The movement attracted support from other organizations, including the Indonesian Workers Welfare Union, led by former political prisoner Muchtar Pakpahan.
The government waited until an ASEAN summit had ended, and at 6.30am on Saturday 27 July, a time chosen to ensure the financial impact would be minimized, a mob claiming to be from the Soerjadi fraction, but actually organised by the government, attacked and occupied the headquarters. This mob included soldiers in civilian clothing and thugs from the army-associated Pemuda Pancasila organization. The attack resulted in many deaths and injuries. According to the National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM), 5 people were killed, 149 injured and 74 missing – mostly from those arrested by the military. The attack was followed by two days of rioting, in which youths burned at least 6 buildings, including that of the Ministry of Agriculture. This was the worst rioting in Jakarta since the 1984 Tanjung Priok incident.
Timeline of the violence.
The following is a chronology of the main events. All times in Central Indonesia Time
Aftermath.
The government blamed the small leftist People's Democratic Party (PRD) for the disturbances, and the military accused it of being communist. As a result, several Islamic organizations, including the Muhammadiyah youth wing, the Indonesian Ulema Council, the Muslim Students' Association and the United Development Party all expressed support for the military action against the party. Budiman Sudjatmiko and other party leaders, as well as Muchtar Pakpahan, were arrested and tried for subversion.Budiman was jailed for 13 years, while his colleagues received shorter sentences. All were released in March 1999.
Megawati's legal challenge to the election of Soerjadi at the Medan congress failed after the Supreme Court issued a ruling that the Jakarta District Curt did not have the authority to hear the case. Further demonstrations in support of Megawati took place in Jakarta. Both PDI factions put forward lists of legislative candidates for the 1997 elections, but the authorities recognized only the list produced by the Soerjadi faction. In protest, Megawati officially announced she would not be using her right to vote. The PDI vote collapsed in the election, with 80% of its voters switching to Golkar or the PPP.
Following the fall of Suharto in 1998, on 1 February 1999, the pro-Megawati faction of the PDI declared the formation of a new party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, as the heir to the old PDI. The party won the largest share of the vote, 35%, of the 48 parties that contested the 1999 elections, the first democratic elections for 44 years, and in October of that year, Megawati became vice-president.

Hotel de Paris (Georgetown, Colorado)

The Hotel de Paris is an historic hotel and museum located in the town of Georgetown, Colorado. The building stands on 6th Street, across from Georgetown Town Hall, in the eastern end of the town. Originally opened in 1875 by French immigrant Louis Dupuy, the hotel became famous for its luxury and the high-class French cuisine offered to visitors, at the height of the Colorado Silver Boom in Georgetown and the Mountain West. The museum is a popular tourist attraction, known for its well-preserved interiors containing over 5,000 items from the Victorian era, 90% of which are original to the Dupuy era. It was purchased in 1954 by the Colorado chapter of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, which have operated it as a museum ever since.
Louis Dupuy.
The hotel was the creation of Louis Dupuy ("né" Adolphe François Gerard), a French immigrant from Alençon born in 1844. As a young man he entered a seminary to study for the priesthood, but left after a short time to enroll in culinary school. Gerard immigrated to the United States in 1866 and briefly worked in New York City as a writer, until he was caught plagiarizing a piece of writing which he sold to the "Illustrated Newspaper" as his own. He thereafter joined the US Army, which sent him West to Cheyenne, Wyoming to work as a desk clerk. For unknown reasons, he deserted soon after, changing his name to Louis Dupuy and walking on foot to Denver, Colorado, where he found work with the Rocky Mountain News as a mining reporter beginning in 1868. Dupuy's work brought him to Georgetown, then a booming mining town, and he soon became a miner himself, which ended in disaster when he was injured in an explosion at a mine near Silver Plume in 1873. Soon after, the community in Georgetown raised money which enabled him to rent the Delmonico Bakery in the Powers Building, plus two smaller adjacent structures, which he transformed into the Hotel de Paris.
History.
The Hotel de Paris opened on October 9, 1875. The establishment was modelled after a French inn in Dupuy's native Alençon, and charged an exorbitant $4.00 per night to guests. The arrival of the Colorado Central Railroad in 1877 provided a further stimulus to Georgetown's growth and Dupuy's business. By 1881 he was able to purchase an additional 1/2 lot to the west, on which he built an extension with four further hotel rooms and an outhouse with laundry facility. Dupuy ensured that the hotel was fitted with the very latest conveniences, including gaslight (replaced in 1893 with electric lighting), radiant heating, and washbasins in every room equipped with hot and cold running water. Dupuy acted as chef in addition to hotelier, using his familiarity with French cuisine to offer unusually refined fare to hotel guests. A wine cellar supplied fine wines, champagne, spirits and liqueurs.
Dupuy made several major additions to the hotel in 1878, 1882, and 1889, which transformed it into the 7,000 square foot building seen today. With the final addition, Dupuy had a stucco covering applied to the façade painted to appear like ashlar masonry, to give the hotel a more uniform appearance. A commercial kitchen was built and the restaurant enlarged, becoming the "piéce de résistance" of the hotel. The dining room featured silver maple and black walnut floors and a dining service of Haviland China imported from Limoges, France. Dupuy, who spoke four languages, furnished his study with over 2,500 volumes written in French, English, German, and Latin, which could be loaned to guests. These are all preserved in the existing museum.
Dupuy capitalized on a clientele of travelling salesmen passing through Georgetown by creating three galleries in the hotel for the salesmen to exhibit their wares to locals.
Some of the more notable guests of the Hotel de Paris included the railroad speculator Jay Gould, photographer William Henry Jackson and English explorer Isabella Bird.
The hotel reached the peak of its success in the early 1890s, but the Panic of 1893 caused a permanent drop in the value of silver, from which Georgetown's mining-dependent economy never recovered. The hotel received minor damage in January 1892, when the McClellan Opera House two buildings down from the hotel caught fire, destroying the opera house and the millinery shop separating it from the Hotel de Paris. In October 1900 Louis Dupuy died after a weeks-long battle with pneumonia, and the hotel passed into the ownership of Dupuy's housekeeper, Sophie Gally, who herself died not long after. In 1903 Sarah Burkholder purchased the hotel and at some point turned it into a boarding house, which she co-managed with her daughter Hazel McAdams. The "Georgetown Courier" called the hotel of the immediate post-Dupuy era "famous the world over" for the continued excellence of its cuisine and the comfort of its appointments. The hotel remained in the ownership of the Burkholder family until 1954, when after years of declining business the family sold it to the Colonial Dames of America.
Museum.
The museum opened in 1954, and offers guided tours in multiple languages. In 1970 the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 2007 it was added to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. On the 60th anniversary of the museum's opening in 2014, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper declared May 24 "Hotel de Paris Day" in Colorado.

To date, the Penang Island City Council has been headed by three successive mayors.
Patahiyah Ismail, who became the first female Mayor of Penang Island in 2015, held the position until 2017, when she was succeeded by Maimunah Mohd Sharif. However, Maimunah's tenure as the Mayor of Penang Island lasted for only a year, following her concurrent appointment as the Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres; Maimunah thus became the first Asian to be elected for the role. Yew Tung Seang was subsequently appointed as the third Mayor of Penang Island, with his term beginning in 2018.

Blackjack Cars

Blackjack cars, founded by Richard Oakes in 1996, was a manufacturer of three-wheeled kit cars based in Helston, Cornwall, England. The company's first car, the Blackjack Avion, was produced from 1996 until 2004, replaced by the VW Beetle-engined Blackjack Zero. In 2008 a lighter variant of the Zero known as the Blackjack Guzzi was introduced, the name derived from the Moto Guzzi motorcycle engine that powers it. Blackjack Zero kits have been unavailable since June 2013.
Vehicles.
Blackjack Avion.
The styling of the two front wheel and single rear-wheeled Avion is based on the pre-war Morgan three-wheeler racing cars. It was launched in 1996 and continued in production until 2004, during which time 69 were built. It uses Citroën 2CV mechanical parts and engine mounted on a steel chassis of Blackjack's own design, all housed in an open-top doorless fibreglass body.
Blackjack Zero/Guzzi.
The Zero is a more performance-oriented car than the Avion, with which it shares its three-wheeled front-wheel drive layout. Introduced in 2005, it was initially powered by a VW Beetle air-cooled engine.
A 2009 review published in "The Telegraph" praises the "elegant practicality and the production-quality finish" of the Zero.

During an excavation in 1976, gold was found at its foundation. At that time, big earthenware pots full of gold were buried in basis of the monuments for their future restoration. The mausoleum was repaired with few percent of the found gold.
There are two-lined inscription in Arabic on the arch-shaped entrance door. Is written in the text:
According to another source, Shakiragha mausoleum was erected by Shirvan Ibrahim’s vizier in honor of his son in 1427, and is called a mansion.
Architectural features.
The mausoleum consists of hall with a dome and a main arch of the facade with ledge. It is built of white stone, which is a characteristic for Absheron architecture.
The mausoleum is cross-shaped in the plan. There are several cross-shaped monuments (Khan's Garden pavilion in Nardaran, mausoleum in Palace of the Shirvanshahs complex and others) by its interior structure in Absheron. However, there is no second monument in the shape of cross by its both internal and external structure as Shakiragha mausoleum in Azerbaijan.

Nellie Gifford

Nellie Gifford (9 November 1880 – 23 June 1971) was an Irish republican activist and nationalist.
Early life.
Born Helen Ruth Gifford on 9 November 1880 in Phibsborough, Dublin to Frederick Gifford (1835/6–1917), a solicitor, and Isabella Julia Gifford (née Burton; 1847/8–1932), she was the fifth child and second eldest daughter of the family of six daughters and six sons. Her father was a Catholic while her mother, a niece of the painter Frederick Burton, was rigorously Protestant. All the children were brought up in the Church of Ireland. The men, emigrated and remained unionist while the women were active nationalists. Most famous were the two youngest, the artist Grace Gifford, and the journalist and broadcaster Sydney Czira.
Gifford grew up in Rathmines and went to school at Alexandra College. She trained as a domestic economy teacher and worked for seven years at a series of positions in Co. Meath.
Nationalism.
Gifford experienced the living conditions of the landless rural poor while lodging in labourers' cottages during this time. As a result, she became a supporter of the campaigns of the land agitator and nationalist MP Laurence Ginnell. 
She was also influenced by her sisters nationalism and feminism. With them, she became involved with the Irish Women's Franchise League, and got to know Countess Constance Markievicz. She got parts in stage plays, including ‘Eleanor's enterprise’ by George Birmingham in the Gaiety Theatre, a play produced by the countess's husband, Count Casimir Markievicz.
During the 1913 Dublin lock-out she assisted James Larkin enter the Imperial Hotel, on August 31 to address the crowd. He entered in disguise, that of an elderly and infirm clergyman. Gifford posed as his niece. She spoke to the hotel staff to prevent Larkin's strong Liverpool accent giving away his identify. This was the speech which precipitated the "Bloody Sunday" police baton charge. Gifford went on to be a founding member of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA). This group was attractive to many women due to the feminist beliefs of James Connolly. 
She gave lessons on camp cookery in Liberty Hall and found jobs for recruits coming in from abroad. As a result of this work she, very fatefully, introduced Michael Collins to her future brother-in-law Joseph Plunkett who went on to serve together in the 1916 Easter Rising; Collins was Plunkett's aide-de-camp.
Gifford was the only one of her sisters actively to participate in the rising itself. She was with the ICA's St Stephen's Green contingent alongside Countess Markievicz. Throughout the week she supervised the garrison's provisions in the College of Surgeons' building, commandeering food from shops and bread vans, and by courier from other garrisons. She also ensured the delivery of provisions to troops both in the college with her and in outlying posts. Gifford was one of the women arrested at the surrender and jailed in Kilmainham Gaol. At the same time, in the same prison her sister Grace married Joseph Plunkett hours before his death. Only twelve women were detained after the main release women prisoners on 8 May 1916. Gifford was one of those transferred to Mountjoy Prison until her release on 4 June 1916. Afterwards she continued to be as involved in the campaigns.
After her time in prison, Gifford travelled through England to the USA where she and other women veterans of Easter week lectured throughout America. While there she married Joseph Donnelly, of Omagh, Co. Tyrone in 1918. In 1921 she and their year-old daughter Maeve left him to return to Ireland.
Later life.
Frederick Gifford died in September 1917 and left her £800. However Gifford was not well off. She became a broadcaster and journalist for the national radio and the Irish press. Holding to her upbringing Gifford remained a staunch Protestant, unlike four of her sisters, who had married Catholics. 
She became devoted to preserving the historical record of the independence movement. Noticing the huge number of visitors for the 1932 Eucharistic Congress she organised a small exhibition there of 1916 memorabilia for the National Museum of Ireland. She was irritated by the display of Catholic religious artifacts there. She campaigned for a permanent exhibition of recent Irish nationalist history. Gifford coordinated a substantial body of material pertinent to nationalist organisations, the Easter rising, and the war of independence, which now forms the core of the present collection.
Over the years Gifford was secretary of the Old IRA Association, a member of the Old Dublin Society, and a founder of the Kilmainham Gaol Restoration Society. She also looked after stray and neglected dogs and cats. She died on 23 June 1971 at the Gascoigne nursing home in Rathmines, Dublin, aged 90.

Alfred Cohen

Alfred Cohen was an American artist whose art was firmly rooted in the European tradition; he was inspired in particular by the "commedia dell'arte"; and by the colour and handling of the Post-Impressionists and Expressionists.
Biography.
Cohen was born on May 9, 1920 in Chicago. His father, a furniture dealer, had emigrated from Latvia to America, where he married the daughter of another Latvian emigre.
Cohen attended the Art Institute of Chicago, but left to enlist in the US Army Air Corps. He served from 1942 to 1945 as a navigator in Flying Fortresses and Liberators based in the Pacific Theater.
After the war Cohen returned to the Art Institute, where he studied under Louis Ritman, Boris Anisfeld (who collaborated with Leon Bakst) and Egon Weiner. In 1949 he was awarded a fellowship to study in Europe, where he was to spend the rest of his life. He lived in France and Germany, and travelled widely throughout the Continent. Cohen and his first wife, Virginia Adler, lived in Sam Francis' old studio on the Boulevard Arago in Paris, where he studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière.
Artistic career.
Cohen's work was representational and figurative, owing most to Raoul Dufy, Bonnard, Marc Chagall, Oskar Kokoschka, Georges Rouault and Chaim Soutine. His favourite subjects were ports and river banks, vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits. .
In the 1950s Cohen staged one-man exhibitions in Germany and Paris. French critics described him as an 'intimist', 'ranking among our best painters', and hailing his paintings as 'good, direct and natural'. In 1958 he had his first one-man exhibition at the Ben Uri in London, where two years later he decided to settle. His exhibition at the Obelisk Gallery in 1960 was the first of several sell-out shows in Britain.
Cohen had already met with considerable success in Germany and France. But with the large canvases of his "Aspects of the Thames" exhibition in 1961 Cohen really began to win critical acclaim in Britain too.
Anita Brookner wrote in the "Burlington Magazine" that Cohen was 'a fresh and accessible artist of considerable accomplishment, whose abstract impressionist compositions were enlivened by an acute charm of colour'. "The Tatler" admired 'the rich sense of colour that makes his work immediately striking and lastingly memorable' and again noted the combination of abstract design and representation which remained important throughout his career: 'Look (...) at almost any few square inches of a Cohen canvas and you have a little gem of abstract painting'. Edward Lucie-Smith, in "Arts Review", found the paintings 'strikingly well constructed', adding: 'the architecture is nearly always firm and logical. . . . I admire these pictures most as virtuoso demonstrations of technical skill. They have immense panache and glitter, and yet they are self-consistent'. The "New Daily" appreciated the 'visionary quality' of their effects of light.
Cohen followed this with an exhibition at the Brook Street Gallery in 1963, on the theme of the "commedia dell'arte." The "Daily Telegraph" described the technical achievement of his images as 'formidable', and declared him 'one of the best draughtsmen at work today', adding that 'Only Picasso in one or two early works has in our time touched such depths through the characters of the "Commedia dell'Arte'." Conroy Maddox, wrote in "Arts Review" that 'The paintings are a show of force and theatricality (...) Cohen has certainly gained a sensuous richness and a robust and vigorous way of handling his material'.
The inspiration of the "commedia dell'arte" was to recur throughout Cohen's work. But once again he resisted the temptation to repeat a successful formula, and completely reinvented his painting yet again. Now he turned his attention to the landscape of Kent, where he settled with his second wife, Diana Saunders, in 1963. His exhibition of 'Recent Paintings' at the Brook Street Gallery in 1965 sounded a note that was to remain important in Cohen's work, focusing on the English countryside and country people. His attraction to Britain never waned. 'I don't want to leave it. America is no longer my home. I feel more of a foreigner there than I do anywhere in Europe.' But he was also attempting to capture the features of the land that most perplexed him. First, its postwar air of decline: 'It is crumbling from the inside, and crumbling in style. It's elegant, but there's danger in the elegance.' But also the challenge represented by its crowded seclusion. As the writer Philip Oakes explains: 'He evolved a new style, using paint like a sculptor, laying down slabs of colour, carving it with his brush so that the fields and hedges and houses seemed to be hewn from the canvas'.
Cohen's British landscapes were well-received too, with critics continuing to praise his compositional intelligence. "Pictures on Exhibit" said:
There are very few artists of today's generation with the ability to synthesise the quality of 20th Century Ecole de l'Europe in the sense that the late impressionists and the post-impressionists did it for their epoch. Alfred Cohen is one of them, and maybe this explains his success with a wide category of collectors. Their enthusiasm is unstinting (...) There are few enough painters like [Cohen] nowadays; hardly one capable of capturing the British scene in such an attractive and authoritative way.
Cohen had nine one-man exhibitions in London, and others in Heidelberg, Hannover, Paris, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo, Cape Town, Belfast, and many other cities and towns in England, including Cambridge, York, Harrogate, Leeds, Rye, and King's Lynn. He had two-person exhibitions with Josef Herman, Patrick Hall, and Mary Newcomb. And his work was also included in many international mixed exhibitions, such as one at the U.S. Embassy in London of 'Five Americans in Britain', with R. B. Kitaj and others.
In the late 1960s he joined Roland, Browse and Delbanco, in Cork Street, which combined exhibitions of artists such as Rodin and Matthew Smith with work from contemporary artists such as Phillip Sutton, Keith Grant and Cohen's friend Josef Herman. The first of his four exhibitions there was in 1969. It continued the exploration of the country. 'He was always effective and satisfying', wrote the "Jewish Chronicle", 'but his Kentish landscapes have been a consistent breakthrough . . . . He has things in common with several good artists, but most noticeable with what de Stael might have painted had he been able to sustain himself at his best. For Cohen now uses that thick impasto in jewel-like colour-blocks that are subtly balanced. The variety of blues and greens, and of reds, that he can weigh in his balance is astonishing'. But he also began to return to the Channel coast, seen from both sides, and in new ways. James Burr, in "Apollo", noted:
Many subjects have engaged the expressionist fervour of Alfred Cohen; in these recent paintings, the boats and houses of the coastlines of France predominate. He reacts with a fierce passion to direct experience that is organized into a formal structure. . . . His emotional power and exuberantly vigorous response infuses his paintings with an intensity that makes much contemporary expressionism look feeble.
It was this return to coastal paintings that was to characterize much of his later work. Marina Vaizey reviewed his second show at Roland, Browse and Delbanco in 1972 for the "Financial Times", commenting on how the works 'play on the borders of abstract and representational art', and noting: 'He is particularly fond of a deep range of blues, and sea-greens, and the compositions have a deliberate naiveté that is charming but never cloying'. The "Jewish Chronicle" said: 'Like Marquet, Cohen paints beautifully, but more warmly. . . a man who is passionately concerned about painting well, and who has also a first-rate sense of colour, deep and rich, belonging to the earth and the sea'. Of Cohen's last exhibition with Roland's in 1976, Brian Wallworth wrote in "Arts Review:"
Paintings and drawings of astonishing vivacity and assurance. . . . Each one is a fully resolved picture of an obviously very intense visual sensation felt by the artist. . . . delicious . . . What a perceptive, revealing and loving eye this American turns on the people, places and atmospheres of Kent! . . . there is a fine wildness about Cohen's pictures that instantly commands attention. . . .
That exhibition represented yet another new departure. As Peter Stone wrote: 'Alfred Cohen is unique. I can think of no other artist whom I have followed since his beginning and found to be literally better in each succeeding exhibition. . . . Here is a new line of free and easy drawings of characters like cartoons. You can't pass them without a chuckle'.
In the mid-1970s Cohen took up print-making. His hand-coloured etchings, often of flowers, were sold worldwide. He also turned his sense of space and design to the renovation of houses. In 1978 he and Diana moved to Wighton, north Norfolk, where they converted an old schoolhouse into a studio, print workshop, and art gallery. They later discovered that this was the house where Henry Moore had lived as an art student in the 1920s, and where he had begun to sculpt. When landscaping the garden, the Cohens unearthed a marble carving that had been left unfinished and they returned it to Moore.
Like many painters, he loved the light in Norfolk, its skies, and above all its coast. He often exhibited there. Tony Warner found his exhibition at the King's Lynn arts centre in 1991 'invigorating', describing how it: 'glows with colour. . . . There is an obvious joy in the visual world. . . . each painting is carefully crafted. Layers of paint build up to an intricate pattern of complementary colours. The structures are worked out with an almost mathematical precision, each part firmly measured against the painting as a whole'. Of his only one-man exhibition at the School House Gallery, in 1994, the "Eastern Daily Press" commented: 'Alfred Cohen is recognized as one of the finest colourists and draughtsmen living in England. . . .' His collectors latterly included Sir Keith Joseph, Judge Stephen Tumim, Lord and Lady Norwich, and John Madden.
Cohen continued painting, drawing, etching, and producing screenprints, collages, and assemblages up until his death, on 25 January 2001 at King's Lynn. While the paint surfaces became flatter, less illusionistic, their materiality more insistent, his attention to effects of light, water, and colour, was as intense as ever.
Reception.
Obituaries appeared in all the major broadsheets. "The Times" praised his 'vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits', as well as his 'evocative scenes of the Thames'. "The Independent" recalled that 'Once in Europe he . . . made his reputation in its galleries, where his unmistakably chunky, jewel-like canvases were for several decades much sought-after'. The "Daily Telegraph" concurred, recording how 'His work became increasingly sought after, by such notable collectors as James Mason, Stanley Baker, and Sam Wanamaker', adding: 'A gregarious man, and a friend to many other artists, Cohen also possessed a photographic memory and an encyclopaedic knowledge of Hollywood cinema. His conversation, like his art, bubbled with wit and satire. He hated pomposity or prejudice and was passionately liberal in his beliefs'. The "Jewish Chronicle" described how he 'produced a prodigious number of vibrant and colourful paintings. . . . Well received in France, he was equally acclaimed when he moved to London. . . . His hand-coloured etchings . . . were popular in Europe, the US and Japan'. And the "Guardian" called him 'a brilliant colourist and deft draughtsman', admiring his 'vibrant oils of the Seine, the Thames and the Channel ports, and some telling portraits', as well as his 'restless energy' and the wit of his cartoons and constructions.
Two retrospective exhibitions have since been held: the first at the School House Gallery from May–June 2001; the second at the London Jewish Cultural Centre from October 2001 – March 2002. Derek Gillman, Director of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, wrote for the first: 'He was a grand artist, a great colourist, a forceful designer, and a highly acute observer of places and people. He also made very fine prints, with the same intelligence and wit.' Lady Vaizey, opening the London exhibition, spoke of how Cohen's work was 'filled with warmth, life, affection, pleasure in the beauties and good realities of the present day'. Howard Jacobson, in the "Independent", praised his 'wonderfully violent paintings':
he painted sensuously, in paint rather than in epigrams, and, like many of the best artists still alive in the last quarter of the 20th century, had to take a back seat to that institutionalised facetiousness we know as conceptualism. . . . It should, of course, be Tate Modern that exhibits him, but he's a little hot for their whitened aesthetic. . . . And not only too hot, but too possessed of the satiric daemon. For me, although you can see the influences of Vuillard and Kokoschka and Soutine on Cohen, his best work has Daumier behind it, the vigorousness of caricature and the savage grotesqueries of the commedia dell'arte. . .
Alfred Cohen's work is represented in the Ben Uri Art Society, Bradford City Art Gallery, British Council, The Castle Museum Norwich, The Contemporary Art Society, The Department of the Environment, Eastern Arts, Ein Harod Museum (Israel), Essex and Bedfordshire County Councils, Ferens Gallery (Hull), Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, Girton College, Cambridge, The Government Art Collection, Lancaster University, Maidstone Museum and Bentlif Art Gallery, Musée d'Art Moderne d'Eilat, National Collection of the French Government, Norfolk Contemporary Arts Society, The Nuffield Foundation, Pallant House Gallery, Pembroke College Oxford, Rye Art Gallery, Smart Museum, University of Chicago, Spertus Museum, Chicago, The Stanley and Audrey Burton Gallery, University of Leeds, The Stanley Picker Trust, Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, University of East Anglia, St Paul Art Gallery, Minnesota, South East Arts, The Trianon Press, Paris, Trinity College Oxford, Tunbridge Wells Museum and Art Gallery, University of Wisconsin, and Wolfson College Oxford.
The Alfred Cohen Art Foundation (Registered Charity No. 1097812) was established as a charitable trust in 2001. It is based in Cohen's last home, The School House Gallery, Wighton, Near Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk NR23 1AL.

Alice Lloyd (actress)

Alice Wood (20 October 1873 – 17 November 1949), known professionally as Alice Lloyd or Alice Hall, was a British music hall artist who was popular in America.
Life.
Lloyd was born in Hoxton, London into the Wood family that included her elder celebrity sister Marie who adopted the name Marie Lloyd. There were ten children and many of them adopted the name Lloyd to appear in the music hall. Marie, Alice and Grace appeared as the "Sisters Lloyd".
Her sister Marie Lloyd was popular in Britain and it said that an American theatre owner, Percy G. Williams signed up Alice via his agents. He mistakenly thought he had contracted her elder sister Marie. Alice appeared in Vaudeville on Broadway in 1907 and it was claimed that her name was placed in lights of the theatre straight after her first performance. It was said that Marie was too coarse for American audiences and they preferred the more restrained Alice.
In 1908 she was on the ocean liner RMS Mauretania when a broken propeller damaged the ship. It was reported that Alice sang for an hour to calm the passengers whilst power was restored to the vessel.
In 1909 she was appearing in Seattle in her first tour of western America.
Lloyd died in the home in Banstead, Surrey in 1949.

Anne-Kathrin Dern

Anne-Kathrin Dern (born July 30, 1987) is a German film composer and CEO of e-Quality Music Productions LLC, currently residing in Los Angeles, California. She is mostly known for her scores to Fearless (Netflix, 2020), The Claus Family (Netflix, 2020), and "" (2018), as well as her collaborations with Klaus Badelt, most notably on "Leap!" (2016).
Early life and education.
Anne-Kathrin Dern was born in Eutin (Eastern Holstein), Germany, to Kathrin Dern (née Paskarb) and Uwe Dern. She later grew up in Hildesheim (Lower Saxony), Oebisfelde (Saxony-Anhalt), and Peine (Lower Saxony). After graduating from the Ratsgymnasium Peine in 2007, she went on to study at a private film scoring academy called musicube. Once she had obtained her Basic Film Music Composer certification, she moved to the Netherlands to further her studies in the newly developed film scoring program at the ArtEZ Conservatory. After receiving her bachelor's degree in 2012, Dern moved to Los Angeles to attend the UCLA Film Scoring program where she concluded her studies.
Sample library development.
While still at UCLA, Dern was hired by sample developer Cinesamples in early 2013. As part of their in-house team she helped develop new virtual instruments as well as updates to existing libraries. Products Dern worked on include
After resigning from her full-time position at Cinesamples in late 2014, Dern continued to sporadically work for other sample developers, including SonicSmiths ("The Foundry") and VIR2 / Big Fish Audio ("Aeris Hybrid Choir Designer", "Apollo Cinematic Guitars", "Mojo Horns Vol." "2"). She also programmed a private percussion library for the music production and publishing company Ninja Tracks
Film composition.
Cinesamples' sister company Hollywood Scoring hired Dern in 2014 as a mockup artist and staff composer. As part of the team she worked on productions like Riot Games' "League of Legends", Microsoft's "", Disney's "The Pirate Fairy", Fox's "Gracepoint", and many more. A mockup she created for Alan Menken ultimately led to her being brought onto the "Galavant" composing team. Being located at Christopher Lennertz' Sonic Fuel Studios she transitioned into being an arranger for his score on the first season of ABC's medieval musical show in late 2014 / early 2015. At the same time she also worked as an orchestrator and technical assistant at William Ross' studio Momentum.
Throughout most of 2015, Dern worked with Pinar Toprak on the Warner Bros. / Skydance production "Geostorm", starring Gerard Butler. She also collaborated with composer Ryan Shore on his animated series ' and his Universal movie '. Later in 2015, Dern also worked as a temporary assistant at Steve Jablonsky's studio Arata Music, lending a hand on "The Last Witch Hunter" starring Vin Diesel. In fall 2015, Dern resumed her work for Christopher Lennertz and Alan Menken on the second season of "Galavant".
In early 2016, Dern went back into a learning environment by accepting an internship position at Hans Zimmer's Remote Control Productions. Shortly after the internship, composer Klaus Badelt took notice of her and invited her onto his team for the animated movie "Ballerina" starring Elle Fanning. Aside from her involvement in the score, Dern also wrote orchestral arrangements to some of the movie's songs by Sia and Chris Braide. It was later picked up by the Weinstein Company and released in U.S. territories the following year under the title "Leap!". While working on several theme park rides with Badelt, Dern was also selected as one of the 12 composers out of over 300 applicants for the annual ASCAP Film Scoring Workshop by Richard Bellis.
In early 2017, Dern collaborated with composer Emir Isilay on the Pakistani drama "Saawan". Their score was nominated for Best Original Score at the Madrid International Film Festival and later won the Best Soundtrack Award at the Salento International Film Festival. It was also selected as Pakistan's official entry for the Academy Awards. This production was quickly followed by the Chinese-American drama "The Jade Pendant" based on the novel by L.P. Leung, and the German fantasy movie "Lilly's Bewitched Christmas" (aka "Hexe Lilli rettet Weihnachten") based on the popular children's books by Knister. Both scores led to several positive nods by critics and most notably garnered her a coveted IFMCA nomination for "Breakthrough Film Composer Of The Year". In spring 2017, Dern was chosen as one of the 10 female composers for the first installment of the now annual Future Is Female concert series, produced by composer and singer Tori Letzler. Dern conducted the Hollywood Chamber Orchestra throughout the entire second half of the concert and contributed her suite from The Jade Pendant. The suite was performed again later in fall of the same year by the Alhambra Orchestra in Florida during the Silver Screen Concert. Several other feature film productions followed, including the indie drama "Captain Black" by Jeffrey Johnson, a German kid's comedy called "Help I Shrunk My Parents" (aka "Hilfe, ich hab meine Eltern geschrumpft"), and - resuming her work with Klaus Badelt - the Chinese drama "Legend Of The Demon Cat" by Chen Kaige. Dern also collaborated with British composer Daniel James on a Mongolian play and worked on iGot Games' "Lords Mobile," once again with Badelt.
In 2018, Dern continued to collaborate with Klaus Badelt on productions such as "Wish" (Prana Studios), "Ocean's 8" (Warner Bros.), and iGotGames' mobile games "Castle Clash" and "Galaxy Mobile". She also wrote an orchestral song arrangement for the song "Back To Earth" by Chris Braide for 3QU Media's animated movie "Trouble". In mid 2018, Dern went on to collaborate with Enrico Natale (More Productions) and Elease Patrick for the award-winning short film "Broken". She later signed on to write the score for the award-winning Pakistani feature drama "Allahu Akbar" (2019), directed and produced by Farhan Alam (MAB Productions).
Throughout the winter of 2018/2019, Dern once again teamed up with blue eyes Fiction to write the score for "Four Enchanted Sisters", which was released by Disney in January 2020. Dern traveled to Brussels to record and conduct the score at DaDa Studios with musicians from the Brussels Philharmonic. In spring 2019, Dern signed on to write music for the animated Netflix Original "Fearless_(2020_film)" (2020), a science-fiction adventure score which was performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra under the direction of Andy Brown, and recorded by Jake Jackson at Abbey Road Studios. Dern also wrote a few Mozart arrangements for composer Nicolas Repetto's feature documentary "The Sound Of Identity" and conducted them during a recording session at United Recording Studios. During fall 2019, Dern went on to write additional music for director Alex Perry's feature documentary "Angle" (2020), starring Kurt Angle, Dwayne Johnson, and Ronda Rousey.
During winter 2019/2020, she is also wrote the score for blue eyes Fiction's sequel "Help I Shrunk My Friends" (2021). She recorded the score in a unique way at Galaxy Studios in Belgium during lockdown. Dern also scored the Netflix Christmas movie "The Claus Family" (2020) which she recorded with FAME'S in Northern Macedonia. She also produced a song arrangement for the Netflix animated short "If Anything Happens I Love You" (2020). Dern is set to score the horror movie "dEvil" next, with Klaus Badelt producing the score. After that she has signed on to work on Julien Kerknawi's war drama "The Last Front", starring Iain Glen and Sasha Luss, as well as the Netflix Christmas sequel "The Claus Family 2". She will also score the upcoming Dutch/Belgian series "Peter Puck" and the short film "V &amp; F".
Next to collaborating with other composers, Dern frequently works with several directors and producers, such as Blue Eyes Fiction, Julien Kerknawi, Galaxy Studios, Straw Weisman, Robyn Klein, and Enrico Natale. Her international catalogue ranges from the US to Canada, China, Mongolia, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Pakistan, Germany, and France. Her scores are frequently recorded at AIR Lyndhurst and Abbey Road Studios in London by the LSO and LMO. As part of her initiative to promote the visibility of ethnic and gender minorities in film scoring, Dern was featured on the official AVID blog and was invited to a roundtable at Output. Dern was also invited as a speaker on the AVID main stage at NAMM in January 2019. Her piece "He Is Not Coming Back" was performed by the Orchestra Moderne under the direction of Amy Andersson at Lincoln Center, NY, as part of the concert "Women Warriors: Voices of Change". Dern is a member of the performing rights organizations ASCAP and GEMA. Dern is represented by Michal Marks from A-Muse Management.
Reviews.
Dern has received very favorable reviews of her works, most notably "Lilly's Bewitched Christmas" and "The Jade Pendant". Jonathan Broxton, president of the IFMCA, particularly points out the very traditional melodic writing in his review for The Jade Pendant: "The score is built around a stunning – and I do mean "stunning" – main theme. Rich, classical, lush, emotional, written for the full orchestra, with the main melody carried by different instruments depending on the situation, it’s one of the best new main themes of the year. Think of all the great Chinese-style themes played by a western orchestra: John Williams’s Memoirs of a Geisha, Rachel Portman’s Joy Luck Club, Conrad Pope’s Pavilion of Women, Klaus Badelt’s The Promise [...]. This is up there with them." About Lilly's Bewitched Christmas he says "...it shows her to have a fluid orchestral style filled with easy thematic ideas, lovely harmonies, and – on this score, specifically, a wonderful whimsical way of conveying the magic of Christmas. [...] The score has quite a bit in common with other seasonal efforts like John Williams’s Home Alone, Danny Elfman’s Edward Scissorhands, John Debney’s Elf, Bruce Broughton’s Miracle on 34th Street, Alan Silvestri’s The Polar Express, and others of that type, in the way it blends a full and lush orchestra with seasonal orchestrations – chimes, sleigh bells, glockenspiels, and even an occasional choir. [...] There’s also more than a hint of Williams’s music for the first two Harry Potter scores in the way it conveys the mood of magic and witchcraft – the string phrasing, the woodwind counterpoint, the frisky and mischievous tempos, the frequent use of a celesta." He further describes "Anne Kathrin Dern as a serious talent to watch".

Richard Pickersgill

Richard Pickersgill (18 April 1749 in West Tanfield, North Riding of Yorkshire, England – July 1779 in London) was an English naval officer who accompanied the sailor and explorer James Cook on two of his Pacific voyages.
Richard Pickersgill was born in 1749 in West Tanfield, near Ripon, to Richard and Ann Pickersgill (née Lee). Pickersgill was the nephew of John Lee, the servant of George Jackson, a senior officer in the Admiralty. It is believed that his uncle managed to position him through his relationships on his first ships.
In 1766, at the age of 17, he participated in the circumnavigation of the world under Captain Samuel Wallis on HMS "Dolphin". Two years later, on August 26, 1768, Pickersgill belonged as a Master's mate on HMS "Endeavour", which set off with James Cook to its first South Sea voyage. On this trip he also impressed Cook, who had a high opinion of his skills as a surveyor, his dealings with the indigenous peoples they encountered, and his judgment. When Robert Molineux, the Master of the "Endeavour", died on the return journey to England, Pickersgill was promoted to Master on April 16, 1771. After his return to London Pickersgill was promoted on Cook's recommendation to Lieutenant. On July 13, 1772 Cook began his second expedition with HMS "Resolution", and Richard Pickersgill joined as the Third Lieutenant.
He did not accompany Cook on his third voyage, but in April 1776 took command of the ship "Lyon" and was sent to Baffin Bay on the east coast of Canada.
Richard Pickersgill died in 1779 at the age of 30, when he accidentally fell into the Thames when boarding a ship and drowned.
According to Richard Pickersgill, the Pickersgill Islands off South Georgia in the South Atlantic and Pickersgill Harbour, a natural harbour in New Zealand, were named after him.

Faculty of Theology of the Evangelical Baptist Union of Spain

The Faculty of Theology of the Evangelical Baptist Union of Spain (), also known as the Theological Seminary of UEBE (), is an accredited theological Institute offering graduate and undergraduate degrees in theology. It is affiliated with the Union of Evangelical Baptists of Spain. The seminary campus is located in Alcobendas in the Comunidad de Madrid, Spain.
History.
In 1922, the Baptist Theological Institute (Instituto Teológico Bautista) is founded in Barcelona by Board of Foreign Missions (presently called the International Mission Board) of the Southern Baptist Convention of the USA. The faculty was composed of Nils Bengston, Ambrosio Celma, Everett Gill and Percy Buffard, founder of the Spanish Christian Mission, based in Valdepeñas (Ciudad Real). In 1925 Baptist missionary Vincent Leroy David arrived in Spain and took up the position of director. By 1926 the seminary had fourteen students and, two years later, ten. At this time the faculty of teachers was formed by Vincent L. David, his wife, Nils Bengston and Emilio Mora. One program aimed at training men for the pastorate, while the other trained lay leaders for work at the various Baptist missions.
The seminary was very dependent on aid from North American and was negatively affected by the Great Depression. The contributions of the FMB to the Baptist work in Spain decreased by 33%, and the Baptist Theological Institute of Barcelona had to temporarily cease functioning in 1929. In the fall of 1948 the seminary was reopened with six students after nineteen inactive years. The new director was Dr. Jorge Jennings who had been sent to Spain by the FMB. Classes resumed in a rented building in a popular neighborhood of Barcelona which served both as a study center student housing. Soon the seminary had its own building on Camp Street in Barcelona, bought by the FMB, which in 1957 was expanded and modernized. By then the seminary's director was Dr. Roy Wyatt. The restrictions in Francoist Spain to the Spanish, non-Catholic confessions were hardened in the 1950s, but nonetheless the seminary continued to function. In the 1960s the seminary was closed on two occasions due to internal problems (1959-1961 and 1962-1963).
In 1976, the school moves from Barcelona to the city of Alcobendas in the Comunidad de Madrid. The new installations of what would be a seminary and Baptist center were inaugurated in this town on the outskirts of Madrid. While this decision did not satisfy some Spanish Baptists, but the time and the urban development of the city ended up affirming the Baptist leaders who defended the convenience of placing the most representative institution of Baptist work in the center of the country. In 1978 Mr. José Borrás Cerveró was appointed director, becoming the first Spaniard to accede to this position in fifty-six years. Since then, the successive directors of the Baptist Seminary have been Spanish, and its staff of teachers has also been reinforced with native staff.
In 1997, the seminary takes the name of Theological Seminary of UEBE (Seminario Teológico UEBE).
Campus.
The campus is located at 134 Calle Marqués de la Valdavia in Alcobendas and is 15 to 20 minutes away from central Madrid by train ("cercanías"). "The Seminary is close to parks, schools, recreational facilities, and various, metro, train, and bus stations. The Seminary building is both residential and educational."
Academics.
Since 1922, the seminary has been training most of the Spanish Baptist pastors and leaders, but also of other evangelical denominations, offering formation programs that respond to the current ecclesial and ministerial needs inside and outside Spanish territory. In a 2014 interview Dr. Julio Díaz Piñeiro, director of the seminary, said, "Churches must recognize theological education as part of the teaching ministry of the church, and theological institutions, on the other hand, be at the service of congregations, not of themselves or of a misunderstood intelligentsia."
The seminary offers two accredited degree programs: Bachelor of Theology and Master of Theology. In addition to these the seminary offers others non-accredited degrees and diplomas.
The seminary publishes the "Protestant Theological Journal" as well.
Accreditation.
In September 2011 the seminary received civil accreditation becoming recognized as the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the UEBE.

Kanhoba Ranchoddas Kirtikar

Lieutenant-Colonel Kanhoba Ranchoddas Kirtikar FLS IMS (24 May 1849 – 9 May 1917) was an army surgeon in British India and an amateur botanist. An early Indian member of the Bombay Natural History Society he had a special interest in medicinal plants, he published many papers on botany and a major work on "Indian medicinal plants" was posthumously published by his colleague Major B.D. Basu. He illustrated many of the plates in the book. He also wrote many books on Medical sciences in English and Marathi. Besides being a surgeon and botanist, he wrote Marathi poetry and held strong conservative Hindu views. 
Life and work.
Kirtikar was born in Bombay and studied at the Grant Medical College before travelling to England in 1874 where he became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1876. He joined the Indian Medical Service at a time when it had few Indians and served in the 19th Native Infantry at Solapur and saw action in the Afghan War (1878-1880) and was awarded for gallant behaviour in the Battle of Maiwand. He was then became a Civil Surgeon at Solapur 1898, and Thane from 1881. He also served as 2nd Surgeon at the JJ Hospital and as Professor of Anatomy, Botany and Materia Medica at the Grant Medical College around 1886. He was made Fellow of the Bombay University in 1897 and served as Health Officer for Bombay. He was a contemporary and protege of Dr Sakharam Arjun at the Grant Medical College but during the famous case of Rukhmabai, step-daughter of Dr Arjun, Kirtikar became a hostile witness in court and supported Dadaji Bhikaji, the groom of Rukhmabai. In 1902 he was promoted to Brigade Surgeon-Lieut.Colonel. He retired in 1904. He took an interest in social and literary pursuits apart from science. He was a member of the Anthropological Society of Bombay, the Bombay Natural History Society and served as a Trustee of the Aryan Education Institute and as director of the Deccan Education Society and published several non-botanical works including poetry titled "Indirakavya", "Bhakti Sudha", and "Vilaplahiri". He was also a member of the Masonic lodge of western India from 1886.
He took an interest in fungi, cryptogams and algae that grow in hot-water springs at Bhiwandi. He also made microscopic observations on pollen. In 1896 he made a trip to Australia and wrote an article on his experiences in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. Kirtikar wrote a series on the poisonous plants of Bombay and was working on medicinal plants. In January 1917 Kirtikar began to suffer from phthisis and became bedridden. His work on medicinal plants was published only after his death through the work of his friend and colleague Major Baman Das Basu (1867-1930) in 1918. Kirtikar had been a family guest of B.D. Basu and his brother Srisa Chandra Basu at Allahabad in 1914 and had been so impressed by their library that in his will, he left his own books for Dr B.D. Basu who added them to the Bhuvaneshwari Ashram Library. A second edition was published in 1935 and this was largely rewritten by Ethelbert Blatter, J.F. Caius and K.S. Mhaskar. In 1920, Major Basu gifted the botany related materials to Calcutta University and suggested that they maintain a Kirtikar Herbarium.

Winfried Bühler

Winfried Bühler (11 June 1929 – 14 February 2010) was a German classical philologist.
Life.
Winfried Gregor Anton Maria Bühler was born in Münster. Ottmar Bühler (1884–1965), his father, was a distinguished Professor of Public Law - notably of Tax Law - at the university. Soon after Winfried was born his elder brother died, something which he very seldom mentioned but which nevertheless haunted him through his life. However, the timing of his birth meant that he narrowly avoided wartime conscription into the army or "Volkssturm" (militia). He attended the classics oriented in Bonn, successfully completing his school leaving exams ("Abitur") at an unusually young age. He was still too young to be permitted to progress to a university immediately.
During the Summer Term 1947 he joined a student building gang working on the reconstruction of the destroyed buildings at Bonn University. This guaranteed him the chance to enroll for the Winter Term. Having done so, he began by studying Philosophy and classical Philology. Later he broadened his academic scope to include Romance studies. He was taught at Bonn by the philologists and Hans Herter. He then moved on to Tübingen University where he was taught by . The two became lifelong friends. Bühler's subsequent student career also took in Hamburg, Lyon and Munich. He was by all accounts a serious and committed student.
At Munich Bühler was taught by Rudolf Pfeiffer, who had recently returned from a lengthy period of political exile at Oxford University. He had been obliged to leave Munich in 1937 because Lili Pfeiffer, his wife, had been classified as Jewish by the authorities, which put their lives in danger if they remained in Germany. During his time in Oxford Pfeiffer had further enhanced his already formidable academic reputation, notably with further published work on the Callimachus papyri. For Winfried Bühler to be accepted as a student by Pfeiffer is taken by contemporaries as an indication that he had already himself been marked out as a student of exceptional ability and potential.
In Autumn 1954 Bühler passed his Level 1 teaching exam. On 1 March 1955 he was appointed to a position as an academic research assistant at Munich in classical Philology. His doctorate followed in 1957. His dissertation, supervised by Pfeiffer, was a scholarly and rigorously detailed exploration of the epyllion on Europa by Moschus. The dissertation was in due course published as a book. Unusually, however, this took a further three years because Bühler completely rewrote it, to take account of new research and discoveries and, based on these, new evaluations of the handwritten tradition and Hellenistic usages. He received his habilitation, again from Munich, in 1962. This was followed by a two year research fellowship funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ("German Research Association").
He remained in Munich till 1966. That year he accepted an associate professorship at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he met Paul Friedländer. He returned to Germany just one year later, responding to an invitation from Hamburg University where in 1968 he was appointed to a professorship of classical philologist. Distinguished predecessors at Hamburg included Bruno Snell and Hartmut Erbse. Early on during his Hamburg years, in 1970, he rejected an attempt by the University of Bern to lure him away. Bühler remained at Hamburg till his retirement in 1991. He taught only till 1989, however, which was when funding from the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft made it possible for him to progress without interruption his main project at that time, which was his work on the Proverbs of Zenobius.
After 1991 he retired back to Munich.
Works.
Greek mythology and Paremiography lay at the heart of Bühler's research. He was respected, in particular, as a leading contributor to the . Since 1982 he has engaged in producing a critical compilation of the sayings of Zenobius, which now extends to three volumes.
Memberships and honours.
Bühler was a member of the in Hamburg from 1972, serving as its president between 1982 and 1985. He was a full member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities from 1980, having been a corresponding member since 1974. In 1985 he became a corresponding member of the British Academy He became a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1988. He also, in 2002, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Thessaloniki.

Rise of Industry

Rise of Industry is a business tycoon game, developed by Spanish indie team Dapper Penguin Studios and published by Kasedo Games. The game sees players build and manage their industrial empire as they attempt to grow and expand in the early 20th century.
The game was released to early access on February 9, 2018, primarily through Steam and GOG until it was released as a full release on May 2, 2019.
Gameplay.
In "Rise of Industry", players begin with a sum of money and a map on which to build which is shared with several AI controlled towns and villages. It is your aim as the player to build an industrial empire by supplying these towns and villages with the products they demand.
There are currently two main game modes, Career and Sandbox. In career mode, the player must choose a specialism in which to begin their empire. There are four specialisms to choose from: Gathering, Farming, Industry and Logistics. While all remain open for the player to use, the chosen specialism will grant more Research &amp; Development points, which are used to upgrade in the tech tree. In Sandbox mode, all unlocks are available and the player can build without research and financial limitations.
A game is played on a map which is broken up into regions, each requiring the player to buy a permit in order to build within that region. There are two permit types; a full build permit which enables you to build anything within that region and a logistical permit which will allow the placement of network elements such as railway tracks and roads but not buildings. The player can then start to place buildings such as factories, farms, gatherers etc. and then sell products to towns and villages requiring them. The price paid for your products is set by a global supply and demand system. The more of a product that is available, the less money you will receive, however towns will pay a premium for good that aren't as plentiful. The towns won't just rely on the player to get produce though. They will look to either produce a demanded item themselves, or look for a trade connection with neighbouring towns.
Trade routes play a large part in the game as a function to move your products from A to B. The player can create a trade route for a variety of transport including trucks, boats, trains and zeppelins with each mode of transport having an advantage over another depending on the distance and capacity needed for each route.
Development.
The game was originally named "Project Automata" in early development. Its name was changed to "Rise of Industry" in early 2017.
"Rise of Industry" was released as a pre-alpha version on indie video game store, itch.io in order to gain player feedback in order to improve gameplay before the official early access release. During this time, "Rise of Industry" became the most purchased game of 2017 on Itch.
Reception.
"Rock Paper Shotgun" said that "Rise of Industry"'s early access release was "full of neat ideas" but that "they might wait until further updates to play again". "PC Gamer" called it a "fairly deep sim", although they thought that the lack of flexibility in the game "could put people off". "Hardcore Gamer" however praised Dapper Penguin Studios for "their total openness to their community" and "great willingness to listen to player feedback", stating "this is exactly how an Early Access release should be handled".

1928 United States presidential election in Arkansas

The 1928 United States presidential election in Arkansas was held on November 6, 1928 as part of the 1928 United States presidential election. State voters chose nine electors, or representatives to the United States Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice-President.
Background.
Except for the Unionist Ozark counties of Newton and Searcy where Republicans controlled local government, Arkansas since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic one-party Democratic “Solid South” state. Disfranchisement of effectively all African Americans and most poor whites had meant that outside those two aberrant counties, the Republican Party was completely moribund and Democratic primaries the only competitive elections. As in other areas in and around the Ozarks, a strong Socialist Party movement did develop in the 1900s, but it nowhere was threatening to Democratic hegemony and intimidation largely eliminated its influence from the mid-1910s.
The 1920s did see a minor change in this, as increased voting by poor Ozark whites as a protest against Woodrow Wilson's internationalist foreign policy meant that Warren G. Harding was able to win almost forty percent of the statewide vote in 1920; however despite his national landslide Calvin Coolidge in 1924 could not do any more than win the two traditional Unionist GOP counties.
Native Son Vice-Presidential Candidate.
With all other prominent Democrats sitting the election out, the party nominated Alfred E. Smith, four-term Governor of New York as its nominee for 1928, with little opposition. Arkansas lies in the core of the Ozark “Bible Belt” and would have been expected to stand extremely vulnerable to anti-Catholic and pro-Prohibition voting – its public support for prohibiting the teaching of evolution in public schools showed the Natural State in the vanguard of fundamentalist Protestantism. Elsewhere in the White South, extreme fear ensued because the region had no experience of the Southern and Eastern European Catholic immigrants who were Smith's local constituency. Southern fundamentalist Protestants believed that Smith would allow papal and priestly leadership in the United States, which Protestantism was a reaction against. The Southern Baptist Convention said that 
In other Outer South states and in Alabama, powerful local Democrats refused to support Smith. However, in Arkansas, the two leading politicians in the state, Charles Hillman Brough and Joseph Taylor Robinson, had supported the New York Governor for more than a year before his nomination had become official. Robinson was the first major party Vice-Presidential nominee from a former Confederate state since Andrew Johnson in 1864, and was a moderate who had refrained from supporting either Smith or his rival William Gibbs McAdoo during the disastrous 1924 Democratic National Convention. The fact that Robinson denounced Thomas Heflin’s claim that some American Senators (including Heflin himself) were being paid or bribed by the (anti-Catholic) Mexican Government and quarrelled with the Alabama Senator violently over whether religion could be a qualification for office further linked him to Smith even before becoming his running mate.
During July, the flagging Ku Klux Klan opposed Smith because of his stance against Prohibition, a reform Robinson supported without being dogmatic. However, Robinson’s support of religious liberty was able to ameliorate opposition from Protestant ministers – whom Robinson felt was working for the Republican Party – to a greater extent than other Southern states except for wholly Deep South Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, especially as Brough warned many people that Republican inroads would threaten white supremacy because white girls had worked with Negroes in Hoover’s Department of Commerce.
In counties along the Arkansas River, Smith may have also been helped by the perception that Hoover was ineffective at relieving the disastrous flooding of the Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers a year and a half beforehand.
These uniquely successful appeals ensured that overwhelmingly white counties in Arkansas remained at least relatively loyal to Smith, although Hoover did win eight counties that went for John W. Davis in 1924. On the whole, Arkansas’ voting was erratic outside of the black-belt counties where the white minority that did vote remained overwhelmingly loyal to Smith. Hoover was the first ever Republican victor in Carroll County, Hot Spring County and Polk County, whilst he was the first Republican since Ulysses S. Grant to carry Sebastian County and Washington County.

 or "The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings" is a text in Nichiren Buddhism. "Ongi Kuden" is Nichiren's oral teachings ("kuden") on the Lotus Sutra, which his disciple Nikko Shonin recorded and compiled. (An English translation can be read on the Internet.) 
Some practitioners of Nichiren's teachings regard "Ongi kuden" as one of the most important treatises in Nichiren's writings, because it reveals the essential principles of Nichiren's teachings.(cf.)

In addition, this is explained with the Q&amp;A that "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo" is placed at the beginning of the "Ongi kuden" because it is the core of all (of Shakyamuni's) teachings, and is the essence of the Lotus Sutra. According to Nichiren,
Debate on authenticity.
A large number of Nichiren's writings, in particular those collected and published by Soka Gakkai (called "Gosho zenshu"), have been questioned about whether the texts were truly written by Nichiren (or even by approved personnel) or not and "Ongi kuden", which has been said to be compiled by Nikko, not Nichiren himself, is in the debate. According to the "Heibonsha World Encyclopedia" article on the "Ongi Kuden", a growing number of religious and textual scholars consider the work to be a forgery.

Joseph D. Yerkes House

The Joseph D. Yerkes House was a single-family home located at 42580 Eight Mile Rd in Novi, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and burned in 1989.
History.
In 1826, Joseph Yerkes, his sons William and John, and members of their family moved from Romulus, New York to Michigan and purchased land around Novi and Northville. One of those family members was Joseph D. Yerkes, the eldest son of William Yerkes. Joseph D. Yerkes was born in New York in 1819, and helped his father farm upon coming to Michigan. In 1848, Joseph purchased 80 acres from his father at this location. Between 1870 and 1872, he had a house built for himself, his wife, and their three children.

The front entrance was through double doors in the base of the tower, to one side of which was a small front porch has Gothic, ogee-arch detailing. The windows in the facade were all tall, narrow, double-hung one-over-one units with projecting caps supported by small brackets. Above, the house's broadly projecting eaves were supported by paired brackets, beneath which were centrally positioned roundel decorations.
On the inside, the house had a large living room and parlor in the front of the house, separated by a rich wood archway with paneled double doors, and a dining room and library in the rear. The stairs to the second floor began in the living room and ran between the dining room and parlor.

There are also recurring segments and a studio band with different names but actually the band named "Gloria" and is led by Mark Tavassol. The Florida TV author and producer Jakob Lundt appears as a sidekick.
Show structure.
At the beginning of an episode Heufer-Umlauf performed a traditional stand-up monologue, before changing to a seated. After that one of various recurring segments appears, followed by the first of the episode's guests, which usually include celebrities and actors, literary figures, people in fashion, artists, athletes, and politicians. The guest may return after a second recurring segments and at the episode's end followed by a musical guest.
Production.
Already in July 2017 ProSieben announces a new weekly comedy show with Klaas Heufer-Umlauf for Spring 2018. At the beginning of February 2018 it was finally announced that the late night show named "Late Night Berlin" premiered on March 12, 2018.
In 2018, Late Night Berlin was not recorded in Berlin as the title suggests. However, since its 3rd season began in 2019, it is now filmed at the eastern side of Berlin. This programme is produced by Florida TV, and its 4th season will be returned on September 23, just after summer break.
In 2021, just before days of 2021 German federal election(on Sept. 26), on September 14, this show has successfully returned into its 8th season. This show is to be broadcast every Tuesday at 22:30.

Henry Ernest Boyes

Henry Ernest Boyes (1844–1919) was an American entrepreneur and Navy captain. Boyes founded Boyes Hot Springs in California after discovering hot springs on his property. 
Early life.
Henry Boyes was born into a wealthy family in 1844 in Kingston upon Hull in England. His father was Faulkner Boyes and mother, Margaret Mathilda Saner. of He had two brothers. Both died as children. He attended Queen Mary's Grammar School in Ripon.
Mid-life and career.
Boyes served in the British Navy from 1858 to 1872. During that time, he served in the Indian Navy for four years in Mumbai. After leaving the Navy, he managed an indigo plantation. He returned to Europe and visited Switzerland, where he met Antoinette Charlotte Edwards. The two married in 1883 in England. Boyes sold his family estate for $250,000 and the couple moved to San Francisco, California. 
Founding of Boyes Hot Springs.
In 1883 the Boyes' moved to Sonoma Valley, where they bought 75 acres of land after hearing about the area from Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. The couple lived on a house that was built in 1849 by T.M. Leavenworth. Eventually, another house was built on a 15-acre part of the property, which the couple named "El Mirador." 
Vallejo had told Boyes about natural hot springs in the area and in 1888, Boyes dug two 200 feet deep wells on the property. They pumped the hot water into pools and promoted the therapeutic benefits of the water to the public. They started with one pool, eventually expanding to multiple pools as the site grew in popularity with tourists from San Francisco. The property eventually served as a resort with overnight accommodations. Boyes incorporated the resort as the Boyes' Hot Mineral Springs Co. in 1902. In 1923, the resort was destroyed by a fire. Today, the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn &amp; Spa is located on the site of the former Boyes resort.
Later life and legacy.
Boyes is buried in Mountain Cemetery in Sonoma. His grave is next to the tomb of Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo.

Wild Wild Country

Wild Wild Country is a Netflix documentary series about the controversial Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho), his one-time personal assistant Ma Anand Sheela, and their community of followers in the Rajneeshpuram community located in Wasco County, Oregon, US. It was released on Netflix on March 16, 2018, after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. The title of the series is drawn from the Bill Callahan song "Drover", which features prominently in the final episode.
Reception.
Critical reception.
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 46 critical responses and judged 98% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 8.08 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Wild Wild Country" succeeds as an intriguing examination of a forgotten piece of American history that must be seen to be believed."
Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com wrote "by handling this story so intelligently and by opening its heart to a very complicated idea of good and evil, "Wild Wild Country" has a profound, mesmerizing power itself".
In 2018, "Wild Wild Country" won the Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.
Criticism.
Some have criticized "Wild Wild Country" for leaving out critical information regarding the activities of the Rajneesh followers, particularly regarding sexual assault of women and children as well as possible intent to unleash an AIDS epidemic. Journalist Win McCormack wrote that "Where the filmmakers have fallen down on the job is in the area of interpretation. They have not addressed squarely some of the more important issues raised by their film, and have left others out completely. The latter category includes a few of the cult’s most odious practices, as well as the true extent of the threat it posed not only to its immediate neighbors in Oregon, but to the entire world." Jane Stork, one of the main sources for this documentary, reported in her autobiography "" (2009) that her own children were sexually abused during her time in Rajneeshpuram. This was not included in the documentary.
Osho International Foundation's reaction.
The Osho International Foundation, which co-administers Rajneesh's estate and operates the Osho International Meditation Resort in Pune, India, responded to the docuseries on their website "Osho Times", saying that "Unfortunately, the docuseries fails to explore key aspects and so does not give a clear account of the real story behind the story", and arguing that the events in Oregon were part of "a U.S. government conspiracy, from the White House on down, aimed at thwarting Osho’s vision of a community based on conscious living."
Related films.
In January 2019, Priyanka Chopra announced that she will be starring as Ma Anand Sheela in an Amazon Studios feature film adaptation of "Wild Wild Country". Titled "Sheela", the drama film was written by Nick Yarborough and will be directed by Barry Levinson.
In November 2019, Netflix announced a documentary titled "Searching for Sheela", which follows Osho's former top aide on her first journey home to India in more than 30 years. The documentary aims to give insight into Sheela's involvement and later prosecution for the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in Oregon. The documentary premiered on Netflix on April 22, 2021.

Metavirus

Metavirus is a genus of viruses in the family "Metaviridae". They are retrotransposons that invade a eukaryotic host genome and may only replicate once the virus has infected the host. These genetic elements exist to infect and replicate in their host genome and are derived from ancestral elements unrelated from their host. "Metavirus" may use several different hosts for transmission, and has been found to be transmissible through ovule and pollen of some plants.
"Metavirus" contains five families of the "Ty3/Gypsy" element with either one or two open-reading frames; these families are "mdg1, mdg3, blastopia," "412," and "micropia". Each of the five families contains either one or two open-reading frames, "gag3" and/or "pol3". There is evidence to support that amino acid deprivation in the elements host genome has frequently caused a frameshift towards the "Ty3" element. "Metavirus" corresponds with the "Ogre/Tat" gene lineage.
Morphology.
Species of "Metavirus" are single-stranded RNA retrotransposons. They have an icosahedral and linear conformation and are not enclosed in an envelope. Their diameter is approximately 50 nm and they are usually between 42 and 52 nm in length. These genetic elements contain a core and capsid.
Species.
The following species are recognized:
Evolution.
Because of their high mutation and recombination rate and their ability to conduct horizontal gene transfer, the evolutionary history of many retroelements may be challenging to trace (Benachenhou et al., 2013). Scientists often look to the genomes of "Metavirus" to compare nucleic acid sequences to the sequences of other viruses, constructing lineages and proposing common ancestors.
Multiple taxa of "Metavirus" have genomic sequence that are homologous to other genera of Metaviridae and a suggest common ancestor and/or coevolution. Scientists often look at capsid proteins for evidence of "Metavirus" evolution. Much of the lineage of "Metavirus" remains unsolved and is presently being researched.
Studies.
Mascagni et al. (2017) conducted researched to find homologs and identify strands in sunflower species. In the experiment, DNA was extracted from various helianthus species and the genomes of retrotransposons were identified using BLASTX analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining clustering method and a bioinformatic pipeline was constructed to allow genomic analysis. Two elements, "SURE" and "Helicopia," were identified and placed into the "Gypsy" and "Copia" superfamilies, respectively. Thus, the "SURE" element belongs to the "Gypsy" group, of the "Ogre/Tat" lineage, of the genus "Metavirus". Further analysis led Mascagni et al. (2017) to identify mutations and conclude that the "Metavirus" lineage evolved before "Sirevirus." Mascagni et al. (2017) also found evidence that the "SURE" elements and "Helicopia" elements had hybridized, potential for new lineages.
Nefedova and Kim (2009), conducted a study on "Drosophila melanogaster" to further identify lineages of "Metavirus". Homologs were identified from previously extracted DNA of retrotransposons and "Drosophila melanogaster" and phylogenetic trees were constructed. "Metaviruses" possess the env gene, allowing them to be infective, which Nefedova and Kim (2009) concluded was obtained from horizontal gene transfer from baculoviruses. "Metavirus" contains the roo element which is thought to have been obtained from gene transfer from "Errantivirus," or more likely, the two genera share a common ancestor.

Jurong railway line

The Jurong railway line is a former railway line located in Singapore. Stretching a total of from Bukit Timah to the Jurong industrial estate, the line consisted of a main line and three branches. The line was initially planned as part of the Jurong industrial estate by the Singapore government, to connect the industrial estate with Malaya and to facilitate the transfer of goods between Malaya and Jurong. A $6 million loan was given to the Malayan Railway for its construction, which was carried out by the railway and the Economic Development Board, and construction of the line took place between September 1963 and November 1965, with the first train services commencing in the same month. The line was then officially opened on 4 March 1966. However, the line's potential was limited by Singapore's separation from Malaysia in 1965, with 128,000 tons of freight transported on the line in 1974, and the line eventually closed in the 1990s. Portions of the line remain in place, some of which have become popular among explorers and wildlife enthusiasts.
Route.
The Jurong railway line ran between Bukit Timah and the Jurong industrial estate. It consisted of a main line between Bukit Timah and the Mobil refinery in the industrial estate, and three branch lines, which connected the main line to the heavy industries area, the docks and to the National Iron and Steel Mills respectively, with the total length of the line and its branches being .
From Bukit Timah, the main line ran under Clementi Road through a tunnel. It then ran westward across Sunset Way and the Sungei Ulu Pandan before running along Upper Ayer Rajah Road and Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, and then ran across a causeway before passing through the heavy industrial and port areas of the Jurong industrial estate. The line had three tunnels, eight bridges and 22 culverts along its route.
History.
Background and construction.
The line was initially planned as part of the development of a new industrial area in Jurong, in order to link the Jurong industrial area with northern Singapore and Malaya, and was first announced in July 1960. The line was to stretch from the Jurong port to Bukit Timah station, and the Singapore government intended the line to be utilised for the movement of raw materials into Jurong from Malaya, and to transport goods out of Jurong back into Malaya. For the construction of the line, the Economic Development Board of Singapore provided the Malayan Railway a loan of nearly $6 million, which was to be repaid with the tonnage moved over the line.
Construction on the line began in September 1963. The bridges, tunnels and culverts along the line were constructed by the Economic Development Board, and tracklaying was done by the Malayan Railway. A marshalling yard with six tracks, a small railway station at Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, along with a godown that housed a goods shed and customs office were also constructed. In total, around of earth was moved. At a cost of $5 million and stretching , the line was completed and opened for rail service in November 1965, with initial services consisting of a cement clinker train from Perak. The three branches on the line were then opened in January 1966. The line was officially opened on 4 March 1966. At the line's opening, the Malayan Railway stated that it expected yearly rail traffic on the line to be at least 400,000 tons, and to bring in a yearly revenue of $3 to $4 million.
Operational years.
In September 1967, as part of a westward expansion of the Jurong industrial estate, a extension of the line westward was proposed. With traffic congestion on roads into Jurong, in 1969, the Automobile Association of Singapore suggested that the line be used for passenger service in and out of the industrial estate.
With the separation of Singapore from Malaysia, the ability of the Jurong line to serve the Malaysian market was limited. In 1974, the line handled 128,000 tons of freight. By the late 1970s, the Malaysian government had announced proposals to stop train services into Singapore, with a rail connection to the Pasir Gudang port in its place. The line was eventually closed in the mid-1990s.
Remaining infrastructure.
After the line's closure, portions of the line were dismantled or demolished, while other sections remain in place. The intact sections include a tunnel under Clementi Road, and bridges across the Sungei Ulu Pandan and Sunset Way. In several areas, the line has become overgrown with vegetation. The abandoned rail infrastructure along the line has also attracted nature enthusiasts and explorers.

Kennymore

Kennymore (February 1911 – 1916) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was a highly talented horse whose career was adversely affected by his difficult temperament. He did not appear until the autumn of his two-year-old season but made an immediate impact as he finished third in the Middle Park Stakes and then won the Dewhurst Stakes. In the following spring he won the Craven Stakes and the 2000 Guineas but lost his chance in the Epsom Derby when he became highly agitated before the start. He went on to finish third in the Eclipse Stakes and second in the St Leger before winning the Newmarket St Leger on his final appearance. He died at the age of five in 1916 after a single season at stud.
Background.
Kennymore was a bay horse bred in England by his owner Sir John Thursby, 2nd Baronet. The colt was trained by Alec Taylor Jr. at Manton in Wiltshire. He was a difficult horse to manage and was described as having a "vile temper".
He was sired by Thursby's stallion John o'Gaunt who finished second in both the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby in 1904. The best of his other progeny was probably Swynford. Kennymore's dam was a granddaughter of Brown Bess, who was a half-sister to the 2000 Guineas winner Scot Free.
Racing career.
1913: two-year-old season.
On 17 October, on his racecourse debut, Kennymore finished third behind Cocyra and Stornoway in the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Albert Whalley in the Dewhurst Plate over seven furlongs at the same track two weeks later he started at odds of 4/1 and won "comfortably" from Corcyra and Carrickfergus. After the race the colt was described as "a fairly formidable opponent for classic honours", although The Tetrarch (unbeaten in seven races) was regarded as by far the best British juvenile of the year.
1914: three-year-old season.
Kennymore's classic prospects improved in early spring of when it became clear that The Tetrarch was having serious physical problems and was unlikely to stand further training. The colt began his second season in the Craven Stakes over the Rowley Mile in April in which he was ridden by Frank O'Neill and won at odds of 1/2. It was noted however that he had been troublesome and difficult to control before the start. On 29 April, in the presence of King George V, the colt was partnered by the French jockey Georges Stern when he contested the 106th running of the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance. With The Tetrach absent as predicted, he stated the 2/1 favourite against seventeen opponents. Kennymore led from the start and held off a challenge from Corcyra to win the race by a short head, with two lengths back to Black Jester in third. After the race the colt was promoted to favouritism for the Epsom Derby and his position was consolidated when The Tetrarch was withdrawn from the race in mid-May.
On 27 May Kennymore started 9/4 favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. The start of the race was delayed for more than twenty minutes as the starter struggled to control the thirty-one runners leading Kennymore to become increasingly fractious, lashing out with his hooves and attempting to attack other horses. According to some reports however, the trouble was started when the colt was kicked by another horse, his distress being exacerbated by the rowdy behaviour of the "utterly inconsiderate" crowd. He was facing in the wrong direction and left a long way behind the other horses when the race began and after rushing up into sixth place approaching the straight he faded to finish twelfth behind the French outsider Durbar.
On 17 July Kennymore returned to the track for the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park. As at Epsom, he misbehaved and delayed the start by his "furious antics" and refusal to line up alongside the other horses: it was only with some difficulty that his jockey, Jimmy Clark, persuaded him to race when the starting barrier went up. Although the race was open to older horses the finish was dominated by three-year-old colts, and Kennymore finished third behind Hapsburg (second in the Derby) and Honeywood. Clark commented "he seemed disinclined to race...he disppointed me" but added that the colt would be better suited by "a long, galloping course".
Alec Taylor decided to equip Kennymore with blinkers when the colt was moved up in distance to contest the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at a Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September. He tood the lead from the start and set a "rasping" pace but tired in the straight and finished second, beaten five lengths by Black Jester. After the race Kennymoe's connections were reportedly critical of the forcing tactics employed by Kennymore's jockey Fred Templeman. On 2 October, Kennymore ended his season by winning the Newmarket St Leger over one and three quarter miles against moderate opposition.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Kennymore an "inferior" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
Kennymore was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He had little chance to prove himself, however, as he died in the late summer of 1916 after siring only one crop of foals.

Sivakara Deva I

Maharaja Sivakara Deva I or Sivakara Unmattasimha/ Unamattakeshari was a powerful monarch of the Bhaumakara Dynasty who ruled in the late tertiary part of the 8th century A.D. He was the descendant of Ksemankara Deva who is believed to be the founder of the Bhaumakara rule in ancient Odra and also the earliest organizer of the Varna system in the region. Sivakara Deva I pursued a career of conquest in the eastern part of India establishing the Bhaumakaras as the supreme power in the whole region during his lifetime. He conquered the kingdom of Radha(Rarh) and subjugated the Eastern Ganga rulers of Kalinga as his vassals. He was a devout Buddhist who adopted the epithets of Paramopasaka and Paramatathgata meaning a devout worshiper of Buddha which has been mentioned in the Neulpur charter of the Bhaumakaras. He sent a Buddhist scholar as an emissary to the Chinese emperor Te-tsong or Dezong with valuable Mahayana Buddhist manuscripts and established a new era of maritime trade and cultural relationship between ancient Odisha and China.
Military Achievements.
Sivakara Deva I is glorified as a military champion in eastern India across the inscriptions left by his descendants and others. The Talcher plates issued by one of his descendant Sivakara III compares him with the king Puru and states that he defeated and enslaved his enemies with his might. He is also described as an efficient archer in the battlefield being able to shoot multiple sharp arrows by drawing the bowstring till his ear.
Conquest of Rarh.
Sivakara Deva I marched with a huge army on Rarh and conquered the opponent after a high pitched battle with the forces of Rarh which was situated in the northern part of the Bhaumakara territory. Historian R.C.Banarjee identifies the mention of Rarh in the Bhaumakara inscription with the territory that comprised around the modern Bankura district confined between the rivers Ajay and Rup Narayan. He married Jayavallabhi who was the princess of Rarh kingdom after defeating the enemy. Historians have placed the northern extent of the Bhaumakara kingdom during this era to be Dandabhukti or the area surrounding modern Medinapur and hence established that invasion of Rarh by Sivakara Deva I was just raid in order to subjugate the kingdom as feudal state under the Bhaumakara rule.
Conquest until River Godavari in the South.
Sivakara Deva I sent his son Subhakara Deva I to conquer the southern territories of the early Eastern Ganga dynasty rulers which was also known as Svetaka Mandala or the heartland of Kalinga kingdom. The Dhenkanal charter of Tribhuvana Mahadevi I provides a poetic indication of a fierce battle between the armies Kalinga comprising large number of war elephants and that of Utkala's Bhaumakara dynasty which ended in the later's victory. The entire region from the rivers Rushikulya to Godavari was subjugated by the Bhaumakaras though allowing the Eastern Gangas to continue ruling as vassals under them. An Eastern Ganga king named as Jayavarmadeva mentioned himself as the vassal of Sivakara Deva I in his Ganjam grant and by whose permission he gave away the grants.
Relations with Tang Dynasty of China and personality.
Sivakara Deva I is also recorded to have sent an eminent Mahayana Buddhist scholar named as Prajna with the manuscript called Gandavyuha Sutra to the Tang court of emperor Dezong in China personally autographed by him. The monk Prajna who was a scholar in Buddhist studies at the monastery of Ratnagiri stayed in China for sometime and also translated the Buddhist manuscript Shat-paramita Sutra into Chinese. Sivakara Deva I is mentioned in the Chinese records as "the fortunate monarch who does what is pure, the lion". This initiation of overseas cultural exchange indicates the existence of regular maritime routes for trade and cultural exchange between ancient Odisha and China.
The king is recorded to have many qualities of that employed both his heart and mind. He encouraged new talents and was always accompanied by several scholars. He was effort bound to solve the difficulties of his people and always tried to meet their hopes. The Angul inscription of his descendant Dharma Mahadevi praises him as ""Unmattasimha acquired the ever-lasting renown and resembled the moon covering all regions with great lustre and delighting people by dispelling the heat"." The Dhenkanal charter of Tribhuvana Mahadevi I also praises him for the good qualities like spending money on the construction of various spiritual places, monasteries and temples. He avoided excess personal luxury and taxation of his subjects.

A Pail of Oysters

A Pail of Oysters is a novel by Vern Sneider published in 1953. Set during Taiwan's White Terror era, the book "tells the tragic story of three young Taiwanese people who become involved with an American journalist". Sympathetic to the Taiwanese people and deeply critical of Kuomintang rule, "A Pail of Oysters" was suppressed in the 1950s before gaining new life after the end of martial law in Taiwan.
Aim of the novel.
Sneider hoped that the book would reduce the suffering of Taiwanese people under the Kuomintang. He wrote to George H. Kerr, later author of "Formosa Betrayed", saying the viewpoint in the novel "will be strictly that of the Formosan people, trying to exist under that government. And … maybe, in my small way, I can do something for the people of Formosa." Jonathan Benda, in his introduction to the 2016 edition of the book, argues that Sneider's novel intended "to make Americans think in particular about the regime they supported in Taiwan, but more generally about what the U.S. role in Asia should be".
Reception.
On release the book received positive critical reviews, but was banned in Taiwan and was attacked by the China Lobby in the United States. One academic familiar with the impact of the book commented in 2003 that "copies of "A Pail of Oysters" have disappeared from most libraries, probably on instructions issued to the student spies paid by the KMT to monitor Taiwanese on US college campuses".
Reemergence in the 2000s.
After the end of martial law in Taiwan the book was published in translated editions in both Mandarin Chinese (in 2002) and Taiwanese (2003). A new English edition appeared in 2016, with an introduction by Jonathan Benda of Northeastern University.

Wixom Lake

Wixom Lake was a reservoir in the U.S. state of Michigan from 1925 to 2020. It was named after Frank Wixom, who was instrumental in building the Edenville Dam. Unusually for its size, Wixom Lake boasts a lighthouse on Musselman Island. From 2019-2020, an agreement to buy the dam and reservoir by the Four Lakes Task Force, a "county-delegated authority" under the State of Michigan, from Boyce Hydro L.L.C. was in place, However, in May of 2020, the lake was destroyed when the earthen dam used to impound it overtopped and then collapsed. From 2018 to 2020, the impoundment was regulated by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE).
The lake typically had a surface area of , a shoreline of more than , a maximum capacity of , a normal capacity of , and a maximum depth of . 
Wixom Lake was the third in a series of four reservoirs along the Tittabawassee River, each controlled to a lower elevation during the winter flood control season and a higher elevation during the summer recreation season. In April 2020, Michigan's EGLE sued the dam's operator, alleging it had lowered Wixom Lake's water level without permission in 2018 and 2019, killing thousands of freshwater mussels.
Incidents.
2018–2019 lake draining and lawsuits.
The water level in the lake was lowered by its operator in 2018 and 2019. It said it had requested permission from Michigan's EGLE, which failed to issue it. Despite the lack of a permit, it said it lowered the water "due to concern for the safety of its operators and the downstream community", and it proceeded to sue EGLE in federal court on April 29, 2020. 
The following day, EGLE countersued the dam's operator, alleging it had lowered Wixom Lake's water level without permission, killing thousands of freshwater mussels.
2020 dam failure and destruction.
In May 2020, during severe Tittabawasee River floods, a large earthen section of the Edenville Dam collapsed, requiring evacuations downstream, completely emptying the lake, and rerouting the river to a new course immediately downstream. Governor Gretchen Whitmer subsequently declared a state of emergency for Midland County. Requests to also aid Gladwin County residents is under review by governors staff.

Works attributed to Florus

Three main sets of works are attributed to Florus (a Roman cognomen): Virgilius orator an poeta, an Epitome of Roman History and a collection of poems (26 tetrameters, and five hexameters about roses). As to whether these were composed by the same person, or set of people, is unclear, but the works are variously attributed to:
"Virgilius orator an poeta".
The introduction to a dialogue called "Virgilius orator an poeta" is extant, in which the author (whose name is given as Publius Annius Florus) states that he was born in Africa, and at an early age took part in the literary contests on the Capitol instituted by Domitian. Having been refused a prize owing to the prejudice against North African provincials, he left Rome in disgust, and after travelling for some time, set up at Tarraco as a teacher of rhetoric. Here he was persuaded by an acquaintance to return to Rome, for it is generally agreed that he is the Florus who wrote the well-known lines quoted together with Hadrian's answer by Aelius Spartianus ("Hadrian" I 6). Twenty-six trochaic tetrameters, "De qualitate vitae", and five graceful hexameters, "De rosis", are also attributed to him.
Poems.
Florus was also an established poet. He was once thought to have been "the first in order of a number of second-century North African writers who exercised a considerable influence on Latin literature, and also the first of the "poetae neoterici" or "novelli" (new-fashioned poets) of Hadrian's reign, whose special characteristic was the use of lighter and graceful meters (anapaestic and iambic dimeters), which had hitherto found little favour." Since Cameron's article on the topic, however, the existence of such a school has been widely called into question, in part because the remnants of all poets supposedly involved are too scantily attested for any definitive judgment.
The little poems will be found in E. Bahrens, "Poëtae Latini minores" (1879–1883); for an unlikely identification of Florus with the author of the "Pervigilium Veneris" see E. H. O. Müller, "De P. Anino Floro poéta et de Pervigilio Veneris" (1855), and, for the poet's relations with Hadrian, Franz Eyssenhardt, "Hadrian und Florus" (1882); see also Friedrich Marx in Pauly-Wissowa's "Realencyclopädie", i. pt. 2 (1894).
Some his better-known poems include “Quality of Life”, “Roses in Springtime”, “Roses”, “The Rose”, “Venus’ Rose-Garden”, and “The Nine Muses”. Florus’ better-known poetry is also associated with his smaller poems that he would write to Hadrian out of admiration for the emperor.
"Epitome of Roman History".
The two books of the "Epitome of Roman History" were written in admiration of the Roman people. The books illuminate many historical events in a favorable tone for the Roman citizens. The book is mainly based on Livy's enormous "Ab Urbe Condita Libri". It consists of a brief sketch of the history of Rome from the foundation of the city to the closing of the Gates of Janus by Augustus in 25 BC. The work, which is called "Epitome de T. Livio Bellorum omnium annorum DCC Libri duo", is written in a bombastic and rhetorical style – a panegyric of the greatness of Rome, the life of which is divided into the periods of infancy, youth and manhood. It is often wrong in geographical and chronological details. In spite of its faults, the book was much used as a handy epitome of Roman history, in the Middle Ages, and survived as a textbook into the 19th century.
Florus is credited with being politically unbiased for almost all of his work. However, many will say that after reviewing his descriptions of the civil war, he seems to position himself closer to Julius Caesar than Pompeius. Florus starts his books with the founding of Rome and ends them with the reign of Augustus. The first book of the "Epitome of Roman History" is mainly about the establishment and growth of Rome. The second is mainly about the decline of Rome and its changing morals.
Florus has taken some criticism on his writing due to inaccuracies found chronologically and geographically in his stories, but even so, the "Epitome of Roman History" was vastly popular during the late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, as well as being used as a school book until the 19th century. The use of his writings far beyond his time is a testament to his premier narrative skills.
In the manuscripts, the writer is variously named as "Julius Florus", "Lucius Anneus Florus", or simply "Annaeus Florus". From certain similarities of style, he has been identified as "Publius Annius Florus", poet, rhetorician and friend of Hadrian, author of a dialogue on the question of whether Virgil was an orator or poet, of which the introduction has been preserved.
The most accessible modern text and translation are in the Loeb Classical Library (no. 231, published 1984, ).
Christopher Plantin, Antwerp, in 1567, published two Lucius Florus texts (two title pages) in one volume. The titles were roughly as follows: 1) "L.IVLII Flori de Gestis Romanorum, Historiarum"; 2) "Commentarius I STADII L.IVLII Flori de Gestis Romanorum, Historiarum." The first title has 149 pages; the second has 222 pages plus an index in a 12mo-size book.
Tentative biography.
The Florus identified as Julius Florus was one of the young men who accompanied Tiberius on his mission to settle the affairs of Armenia. He has been variously identified with Julius Florus, a distinguished orator and uncle of Julius Secundus, an intimate friend of Quintilian ("Instit." x. 3, 13); with the leader of an insurrection of the Treviri (Tacitus, "Ann." iii. 40); with the "Postumus" of Horace ("Odes", ii. 14) and even with the historian Florus.
Under Domitian’s rule, he competed in the Capital Competition, which was an event in which poets received rewards and recognition from the emperor himself. Although he acquired great applause from the crowds, he was not victorious in the event. Florus himself blamed his loss on favoritism on behalf of the emperor.
Shortly after his defeat, Florus departed from Rome to travel abroad. His travels are said to have taken him through the Greek-speaking sections of the Roman Empire, taking in Sicily, Crete, the Cyclades, Rhodes, and Egypt.
At the conclusion of his travels, he resided in Tarraco, Spain. In Tarraco, Florus founded a school and taught literature. During this time, he also began to write the "Epitome of Roman History".
After many years in Spain, he eventually migrated back to Rome during the rule of Hadrian (117-138 AD). Hadrian and Florus became very close friends, and Florus was rumored to be involved in government affairs during the second half of Hadrian's rule.

Fobes-O'Donnell House

The Fobes-O'Donnell House is a historic house museum at 1221 Old Turnpike Road in Oakham, Massachusetts. Probably built in the second half of the 18th century, it served as a tavern on what was then a major through road, and housed the town's first post office. It is now operated as a museum by the local historical society. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.
Description and history.
The Fobes-O'Donnell House is located in what is now a rural setting of northern Oakham, on the south side of the junction of Old Turnpike Road and Hunt Road. It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a side-gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with symmetrically placed windows around the center entrance, A single-story porch extends across the front, with late 19th-century Victorian bracketing and slender columns. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule, kitchen to the left, and parlor to the right. A single-story ell extends to the left side. The house stands on of land, substantially reduced from more than the 100 acres it was historically associated with.
The exact construction date of the house is unknown, but appears from stylistic evidence to date from the second half of the 18th century. It was probably built by John Murray, a wealthy landowner from nearby Rutland. Murray held Loyalist sympathies during the period of the American Revolution, eventually fled to Canada. His property was seized by the state, and was acquired by Joseph Fobes in 1799. Fobes operated a tavern on the premises, serving travelers on the turnpike, which was a major route between Boston and Hadley. In 1813, he became Oakham's first postmaster, operating the post office out of this building. The building was sold out of the Fobes family to the O'Donnells in 1894. Members of both of these families were active in local civic affairs, serving in town offices. The house was given to the Oakham Historical Society in 1994 by the O'Donnells.

Six Pack (Gary Burton album)

Six Pack is a 1992 studio album by American jazz vibraphonist Gary Burton.
Reception.
Daniel Gioffre of Allmusic wrote "Gary Burton's peculiar connection and affinity for great guitarists is a proven historical fact, as he has been responsible for bringing such fantastic musicians to the world stage as Larry Coryell and Pat Metheny. On Six Pack, he joins with six different six-stringers for some decidedly varied modern jazz. Kurt Rosenwinkel makes like Metheny on the first track, the up-tempo Mitch Forman composition "Anthem." Any predictability to the song disappears in the presence of the rhythm section of Jack DeJohnette, Steve Swallow, and Mulgrew Miller. One doesn't generally think of the vibes as a blues instrument, and to be fair, it's really not, but Burton gives it the old college try on the title track, where his vibes intersect surprisingly well with Bob Berg's tenor sax and B.B. King's guitar. There is absolutely nothing weighty about this song at all, but it is fun and swinging nevertheless (who says jazz has to be serious all the time?). John Scofield also shows up on the track, and his distinctive tone and phrasing work perfectly in this setting. Other selections include such notables as Jim Hall, Ralph Towner, and Kevin Eubanks, and all of their contributions are solid in their own way. One sometimes wishes that this record was a little less GRP, with Larry Goldings' keyboards and Berg's sax being the most frequent offenders, but there are plenty of hot moments on Six Pack that make this record worth searching out, especially for fans of jazz guitar. Where else will listeners find all of these great players on a single record?"

SMS S90

SMS "S90" was a torpedo-boat of the Imperial German Navy. She was built by Schichau at Elbing as the lead ship of her class, completing in 1899.
At the start of the First World War, "S90" was based at the German colony at Tsingtao, China. At the Siege of Tsingtao in October 1914 she sank the and then was deliberately run aground on 17 October 1914.
Design and construction.
From the mid 1880s, the Imperial German Navy built up a large force of torpedo boats, while building a few larger "Division Boats" to lead the torpedo boat flotillas. From 1898, work began on a new class of larger torpedo boats, the . These ships, known as "Große torpedoboote" or "Hochesee torpedoboote" (large torpedo boats or high-seas torpedo boats) were large enough to carry the extra crew needed to act as flotilla leaders, eliminating the need to build separate Division boats, but, although they were of similar size to contemporary foreign torpedo-boat destroyers, they were still principally intended for torpedo attack, and only carried a light gun armament. 
An initial group of 12 of the new large torpedo boats ("S90"–"S101") were built by the Schichau-Werke shipyard at Elbing in East Prussia, Germany's principal builder of torpedo boats from 1898 to 1901, and this was followed by successive orders for similar ships, of gradually evolving design until 1907.
"S90", the lead ship of the class, was laid down in 1898 as yard number 644, was launched on 26 July 1899 and completed on 24 October 1899. 
"S90" was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced design and deep load. While most contemporary torpedo boats and destroyers had turtleback forecastles, the "S90"-class instead had a short raised forecastle, giving improved seakeeping.
Three coal-fired water-tube boilers fed steam at a pressure of to two sets of three-cylinder triple expansion steam engines. The ship's machinery was rated at giving a design speed of . 93 tons of coal were carried, giving an endurance of at or at . She reached a speed of during sea trials in November 1899, fully equipped and carrying 65 tons of coal.
Armament consisted of three 5.0cm (1.9in) SK L/40 guns, with two mounted side-by-side forward and one aft. Three single 45 cm torpedo tubes were fitted, with one in the gap between the ship's forecastle and the bridge, and two aft. Two spare torpedoes could be carried. The ship had a crew of 50 officers and other ranks.
Service.
At the outbreak of the First World War, "S90" was one of two torpedo boats attached to the German East Asiatic Squadron, with the main base at Tsingtao in China. The elderly "S90", however, was only suitable for local patrols, while the ex-Chinese destroyer was no longer operational. It had been planned to replace these two ships by and . On 22 August 1914, the British destroyer , part of a British squadron patrolling off Tsingtao, spotted "S90" and tried to stop the German torpedo boat from returning to port. "Kennet" fired 136 rounds and one torpedo at "S90", but "S90" was undamaged and reached Tsingtao safely, while "S90"s return fire damaged "Kennet", disabling one of "Kennet"s guns and killing five of the British ships crew. 
Japan declared war on Germany on 23 August 1914, and soon began operations to besiege Tsingtao. On 17 October 1914, "S90" sortied from Tsingtao and torpedoed the before scuttling herself by intentionally running herself aground. Her crew were interned by neutral China in Nanking. They attempted escape on 30 October 1914, but were recaptured.

Barbara Diethelm

Barbara Diethelm (born 12 April 1962 in Zurich) is a Swiss painter, drawer and producer of artists' colours.
Education.
Since her early childhood colour has played a major role for Barbara Diethelm and she developed a sensitivity for colour and an appreciation for the use of paint. After finishing college in Zurich, she moved to the USA in 1982. She studied graphic design from 1983 to 1985 and fine arts until 1988 at San Antonio College under the instruction of Mel Casas, Mark Pritchett and Tom Willome. At the same time, she studied Humanities and Business at the St. Mary’s University in San Antonio. She continued studying painting and printmaking from 1988 to 1990 at the San Francisco Art Institute under the instruction of Sam Tchakalian and Ivan Majdrakoff. During that time, she devoted herself to Far Eastern philosophy and yoga, which has reflected in her artistic work from then on. In 1992, she visited the artist Agnes Martin for a longer period in Galisteo, New Mexico, which made a longlasting impression.
Colour as connecting element.
After her return to Switzerland, in the beginning of the 1990s, she developed her painting in various groups of work. Furthermore, Barbara Diethelm took over the family business Lascaux Colours &amp; Restauro after her father’s death in 1995. She is specifically interested in the development of holistic colour concepts and she developed the colour system Sirius Primary System in 1996. This extended five-colours-system was patented by the European Patent Office.
Her objective as a painter and as a producer of paint for artists is to combine the mental and creative level with the physical and manifest.
In 2004, she founded the nonprofit foundation Fondation Lascaux with her husband, the painter Werner Schmidt.
Artistic work.
Since Barbara Diethelm is familiar with the production of paints, her artistic work revolves around an alchemy of colour: material properties of paint, its aesthetic aspects, up to its spiritual energy and interplay of colours. Barbara Diethelm said in an interview, that everything is a remembering of a deeper knowledge, the knowledge about the unity with the cosmic harmony. She wants to awaken the sense of harmony and balance, which appears in the light of nature.
Since 1985, Barbara Diethelm regularly displays her work in solo and group exhibitions in Switzerland, Italy and the USA.

Cleora alienaria is a moth of the family Geometridae first described by Francis Walker in 1860. It is found in Sri Lanka, the Indian subregion to the Andaman Islands, Thailand, Sundaland, Taiwan, and Lesser Sundas as far east as Timor and Christmas Island.
Adults are polymorphic and show clear color differences; this leads to confusion of classification. The discal spot of the forewing is clearly defined. The caterpillar is a leafy green color with fine linear marbling. There is a narrow, lenticular, transverse white bar anterior to dorsolateral brown tubercles. This white bar is divided centrally by a black triangle. The caterpillar is known to feed on "Falcataria moluccana", "Acacia mangium", "Cinnamomum", "Sambucus", and "Dalbergia monetaria".
Three subspecies are recognized.

Carl J. Nichols

Carl John Nichols (born June 25, 1970) is a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
Biography.
Nichols received a Bachelor of Arts in 1992 from Dartmouth College, where he majored in philosophy and graduated with high honors. He received a Juris Doctor in 1996 from the University of Chicago Law School, where he graduated Order of the Coif and was a member of the "University of Chicago Law Review". He began his legal career as a law clerk to Judge Laurence Silberman of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He then clerked for Associate Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court of the United States.
Nichols worked in private practice and later joined the United States Department of Justice as a deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Federal Programs Branch of the Civil Division, and then as Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. He left the government in 2009 and joined Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, where he worked as a partner until 2019.
Federal judicial service.
Nichols was mentioned as a potential judicial nominee in March 2018. On June 7, 2018, President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Nichols to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. On June 18, 2018, his nomination was sent to the Senate. President Trump nominated Nichols to the seat vacated by Richard W. Roberts, who took senior status on March 16, 2016. On August 22, 2018, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On October 11, 2018, his nomination was reported out of committee by an 11–10 vote.
On January 3, 2019, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the United States Senate. On January 23, 2019, President Trump announced his intent to renominate Nichols for the same federal judgeship. His nomination was sent to the Senate later that day. On February 7, 2019, his nomination was reported out of committee by a 12–10 vote. On May 22, 2019, his nomination was confirmed by a vote of 55–43. He received his judicial commission on June 25, 2019.
Notable cases.
Dominion defamation lawsuits.
On August 11, 2021, Nichols denied motions to dismiss lawsuits charging defamation filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Sidney Powell (1:21-cv-00040 (CJN)), Rudy Giuliani (1:21-cv-00213 (CJN)), and Mike Lindell (1:21-cv-00445 (CJN)).
"TikTok Inc. v. Trump"; Docket # 1:20-cv-02658 (CJN).
On Sunday, September 27, 2020, Judge Nichols, granting in part the motion of plaintiffs TikTok and ByteDance, issued a preliminary injunction partially enjoining (i.e., temporarily stopping) the Department of Commerce's implementation of President Donald Trump's August 6, 2020 Executive Order prohibiting certain transactions related to TikTok. The portion of the prohibition that Nichols enjoined would have barred Apple and Google from offering TikTok in their app stores, and would have taken effect just before midnight that night. 
On December 7, 2020, Judge Nichols granted a second preliminary injunction requested by TikTok and ByteBance, enjoining the remainder of the Commerce Department's implementation of that Executive Order. 
The case (then captioned "TikTok v. Biden") was dismissed by joint stipulation of the parties on July 21, 2021, following President Biden's decision to rescind President Trump's August 6, 2020 Executive Order.
"Donald J. Trump v. Committee on Ways and Means, et al"; Case # 19-2173 (D.D.C.).
On August 1, 2019, Nichols issued a temporary order which barred the State of New York from handing over state tax returns to the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means and established a briefing and hearing schedule. The State, through its Attorney General and co-defendant Letitia James, promptly asked Nichols to dismiss the lawsuit or transfer it to a federal court in New York, on the ground that it cannot be maintained against them where the defendants neither reside nor act. On November 11, 2019, Nichols dismissed the lawsuit, finding that the court did not have jurisdiction over the New York Attorney General or the Commissioner of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance.
Memberships.
Nichols has been a member of the Federalist Society; once from 2003 to 2008 and again since 2018.

Os Afro-sambas

Os Afro-sambas is a 1966 album by Baden Powell and Vinícius de Moraes. It is ranked number 29 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Brazilian Albums.
Background.
Considered a watershed in MPB for fusing various elements of African sound with samba, Os Afro-sambas was recorded by Baden Powell, Vinícius de Moraes, and Quarteto em Cy in 1966.
In the mid-1960s Vinícius was fascinated by an LP of samba de roda songs with candomblé influences from Bahia. Baden Powell had also gone to Bahia and heard the songs of the Bahian candomblé. From this mutual enchantment with samba and religiosity found in Bahia, the Afro-sambas project emerged. The eight songs have a rich and unique musicality: a mix of candomblé and umbanda instruments (like atabaques and afoxés) with timbres common to Brazilian music (agogôs, saxophones and tambourines).
The opening track, "Canto de Ossanha" is ranked number 9 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 greatest Brazilian songs.
Baden Powell re-recorded this album in 1990, again accompanied by Quarteto em Cy, but this time singing the lead vocal himself, Vinícius having died.
Track listing.
All tracks are jointly authored by Baden Powell and Vinícius de Moraes.

Joseph Fox (dental surgeon)

Joseph Fox (7 November 1775 – 11 April 1816) was an English dental surgeon, known also as a philanthropist. He was a pioneer writer and lecturer on dentistry.
Early life.
He was the son of Joseph Fox, a dentist, and his wife, Mary Rogers, daughter of John Rogers, a Baptist minister of Southwark, and was born in Crooked Lane, in the City of London. A medical student at Guy's Hospital by 1794, he became dresser to the surgeon Henry Cline. The lectures he gave on the teeth, from 1799, supported by Astley Cooper who was another of Cline's pupils, were the first to be delivered for a London medical institution. According to the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", there was no British precedent, and possibly none worldwide.
Fox built up a private dental practice in London. He belonged to the Particular Baptist church of John Rippon, in Carter Lane, London.
Education and the Lancasterian system.
In 1807 Fox was taken by Sir John Jackson, 1st Baronet to hear Joseph Lancaster lecture, in Dover. He then met Lancaster and his supporter William Corston in London, and heard the extent of Lancaster's financial difficulties with his education society. With Corston and William Allen, Fox helped put the society, which became in time the British and Foreign School Society, on a sound basis. The initial committee consisted of: Allen, Corston, Fox, Jackson, with Joseph Foster and Thomas Sturge.
Lancaster himself chafed under the committee's tutelage, and became resentful. By 1812 he branched out with a boarding school at Tooting, without approval. Francis Place joined the committee that year, and a rupture became inevitable by 1814, with Lancaster resigning amid acrimony and alleged scandal.
In 1814, Fox and Allen bought into the New Lanark project. They were part of a consortium, including also Forster, put together by Robert Owen, to buy out the original New Lanark investors. The educational interests were relevant to Owen, who had been rebuffed by the Anglican Bell system, closed to dissenters. Fox supported Allen in his successful effort to make Owen allow religious education and the Bible in New Lanark's schools.
Death.
Fox died on 11 April 1816, at his house in Argyle Street, London.
Associations.
Fox was a member of the Askesian Society, and from 1798 was a supporter of Edward Jenner, making his house available for vaccinations. In 1800 he joined the Royal Institution. He corresponded with Josiah Wedgwood II, in particular on the topic of porcelain false teeth.
From 1809 and its founding, to 1812, Fox was Secretary of the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews. He had Thomas Fry as colleague from 1810.
Family.
Fox married in 1808 Ann Gibbs. They had a son and a daughter.

Consequently, he began using a wheelchair. On 23 March 2018, Kampschreur was knighted in the Order of Orange-Nassau.
Education.
Kampschreur was a student at the Beekdal Lyceum in Arnhem, Netherlands. He followed a HAVO education and passed his exams in 2018.
Career.
Kampschreur practiced wheelchair basketball, and represented the Netherlands in U18 and U22 level competitions, at one point being the youngest player in the U22 team, but decided to focus on para-alpine skiing. He won three gold medals on the 2017 World Para Alpine Skiing Championships. Kampschreur has also achieved several podium placements in the para-alpine skiing World Cup and Europa Cup spread over the events slalom, giant slalom and Super-G. He won five gold medals at the 2019 World Para Alpine Skiing Championships
Kampschreur trains at the National Sports Centre Papendal in Arnhem, Netherlands. He has sessions twice a day, five days a week.
2018 Winter Paralympics.
Kampschreur participated in the 2018 Winter Paralympics where he won a gold medal in the men's super combined. This achievement made him the first Dutch athlete to win a medal in Para-Alpine Skiing at the Paralympics. He was chosen to be the flag bearer during the closing ceremony.
Outside sport.
Kampschreur has served as an ambassador for the Johan Cruyff Foundation in the Netherlands.

Levy Fidelix

José Levy Fidelix da Cruz (27 December 1951 – 23 April 2021) was a Brazilian conservative politician, businessman, and journalist. He was the founder of the Brazilian Labour Renewal Party (PRTB) and ran for president of Brazil in the elections of 2010 and 2014. He was particularly known in Brazil for his promise of building a bullet train system connecting São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (the "aerotrem") and for his controversial declarations about homosexuals during a political debate in 2014. He ran for several political posts but never won one. Fidelix died on 23 April 2021 due to COVID-19 complications.
Biography.
Fidelix was born in the town of Mutum, Minas Gerais in 1951 to Jarbas Fidelix, a merchant who worked in the field of transportation, and Lecy Araújo, an educator. He moved to Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of Brazil, and studied communication science at the Fluminense Federal University, but he did not graduate. He later became a journalist and professional advertiser. Fidelix was a Roman Catholic.
At the age of 24, he founded the advertising agency Staff Publicidade and also worked as a design director at Art&amp;Som and Vogue Publicidade. As a journalist, he worked for "Correio da Manhã" and "Última Hora", where he revised the "Diário Oficial da União".
Fidelix worked for the government as a communications assistant and created "Agricultura Urgente", the first national bulletin of agriculture. Through "Agricultura Urgente", he launched Brazil's first ecological campaign, which earned him a presidential medal. He co-founded the business magazine "Governo e Empresa" and the political magazine "O Poder". Around 1976, he was the chief communications officer of Estanave, a company related to Petrobras.
In 1982, he founded "Interface", the first Brazilian magazine about informatics. In 1983, he moved to São Paulo, where he worked for two years as an anchorman for "TV Informátika", a TV program about informatics, in which he interviewed specialists and politicians.
Political career.
In 1984, Fidelix co-founded the Liberal Party with Álvaro Valle. In 1986, he contested his first political election, running for State Deputy of São Paulo, and received 735 votes.
He later switched to the Renovator Labour Party and contested his second election running for Federal Deputy. He received 541 votes.
In 1989 and 1990, he worked as a communications assistant for Fernando Collor's presidential campaign. In 1994, he founded the Brazilian Labour Renewal Party (PRTB), the party he remained with until his death in 2021, and tried to run for president for the first time but was unable to register. He subsequently ran for Mayor of São Paulo in 1996 (receiving 3,608 votes or 0.068% of the total), Governor of São Paulo in 1998 (receiving 14,406 votes) and 2002 (8,654 votes), Alderman of São Paulo in 2004 (3,382 votes), Federal Deputy in 2006 (5,518 votes), and Mayor of São Paulo in 2008 (receiving 0.09% of the vote).
In 2010, he ran for president of Brazil for the first time and placed seventh (57,960 or 0.06% of the total). He ran for Mayor of São Paulo in 2012 and again for President of Brazil in 2014, supporting the Brazilian military dictatorship. He received 446,878 votes (0.43% of the vote), again finishing seventh; this was the closest Fidelix came during his political career to winning an election.
Statements about homosexuals.
On 29 September 2014, during a debate among candidates of the 2014 presidential election hosted by RecordTV, Fidelix stated that homosexuals "need psychological care" and were better kept "well away from [the rest of] us". He also said that Brazil's population of 200 million would be reduced by half if homosexuality were encouraged because "the excretory system" does not function as a means of reproduction. He was asked to apologize but refused, believing that his statements were not offensive.
Fidelix's statements were condemned by opponents like Luciana Genro (PSOL), Marina Silva (PSB), Aécio Neves (PSDB), Dilma Rousseff (PT), who later won the election, as well as organizations such as ABGLT, the Green Party, and even the Ministry of Human Rights. On the other hand, other notable conservative politicians, such as Jair Bolsonaro (PP) and religious personalities, like Silas Malafaia, declared their support for Fidelix.
On 13 March 2015, São Paulo's Court of Justice fined Fidelix with R$1 million for hate speech in his declarations. The court lifted the fine on 3 February 2017 but imposed a revised fine of R$25,000 on 22 February.

Lester Dorr

Lester Dorr (born Harry Lester Dorr; May 8, 1893 – August 25, 1980) was an American actor who between 1917 and 1975 appeared in well over 500 productions on stage, in feature films and shorts, and in televised plays and weekly series. Even a sampling from his extensive filmography attests to his versatility as a supporting actor and his reliability as a bit player. His roles are at times credited, but more often they are uncredited, consisting of peripheral characters who have limited dialogue or appear briefly in a wide range of occupations such as newspaper reporters, hotel clerks and bellhops, taxi drivers, salesmen, police officers, military personnel, waiters, and bartenders.
Early life and stage work.
Harry Lester Dorr was born in Massachusetts in 1893, the oldest of 11 children of Mary E. (née McGinnis) and Edward Peter Dorr. Documents in Cambridge record that Dorr was born there, but his parents soon moved to the nearby town of Lynn, where his father worked as a shoemaker or "laster". By 1900, the growing Dorr family moved from Lynn into Boston. Little more is known about Lester's early life until 1917, when the United States entered World War I and Dorr registered for the military draft. He was living then in Chicago, and on his registration papers he identified his occupation as "Theatre Producer", indicating that he was already involved in or was pursuing a career in entertainment by that time. Dorr's identification of himself, however, as a producer might be attributed to youthful exaggeration or was an unrealized intention, for no subsequent references have been found that credit him or even mention him in that behind-the-scenes occupation during his career.
Dorr married in 1920 and during the late 1920s—before moving to California to act in films—he worked in stage productions in New York, including in Broadway dramas and musicals. He performed, for example, assorted roles in the 1927 revue "Rufus LeMaire's Affairs"; and the following year he portrayed Captain DeJean in the operetta "The New Moon", which premiered at the Imperial Theatre in Manhattan on September 19, 1928.
Films.
The federal census of 1930 documents that Dorr was in Los Angeles by April that year, working there as an "actor/motion pictures" and residing in a rental house with his wife and mother-in-law. He soon was cast in two Hollywood comedy shorts, both released by Pathé Exchange (RKO) in 1930: "All Stuck Up" and "Ride 'em Cowboy". For the remainder of the 1930s, Dorr demonstrated his abilities at portraying an array of characters, such as hotel clerks, police officers, reporters, office workers, elevator operators, salesmen, bank employees, cowboys, mob henchmen, prisoners, truck drivers, train crewmen, soldiers, sailors, and hospital personnel. He was cast, often under contract as a "day player", in more than 250 films in just the 1930s alone, remarkably averaging a different role in a different film every two weeks for ten straight years. A very small sampling of those motion pictures include "Riders of the Purple Sage", "Union Depot", "Central Airport", "Helldorado", "The Mighty Barnum", "Murder in the Clouds", "The Case of the Missing Man", "Show Them No Mercy!", "She Gets Her Man", "Love Before Breakfast", "Sinner Take All", "Snowed Under", "The Firefly", "Expensive Husbands", "Big City", "Criminals of the Air", "Dangerous Holiday", "It's All Yours", "Captains Courageous", "Missing Witnesses", "Pardon Our Nerve", "The Cisco Kid and the Lady", "Test Pilot", "Penitentiary", "The Main Event", "The Crowd Roars", "Coast Guard", "Sued for Libel", "Gone with the Wind", and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". He also performed in several installments of the 1939 serial "Mandrake the Magician", portraying Gray, one of many criminals battling the title character.
Dorr continued to appear regularly in studio productions throughout the 1940s, but with reduced frequency when compared to the preceding decade; nevertheless, he still added more than 140 Hollywood films to his résumé in that decade. His work on the "big screen" decreased even further in the 1950s as acting opportunities increased on television. He was, though, cast in at least 45 feature films and shorts during the 1950s, including small roles in some notable productions, such as "Ace in the Hole", "The Greatest Show in Earth", and "East of Eden". In another, far more modest film-noir production from that period, "Quicksand", Dorr portrays "Baldy", a smooth-talking jeweler. His on-screen sales pitch in that role, in which he convinces the story's leading character Dan (Mickey Rooney) to buy a wristwatch, is typical of the concise, quick-study performances that defined Dorr's career and made him so popular in cost-conscious studio casting offices. Dorr's film work, however, began to draw to a close by the 1960s, when he served in bit parts in only five films. Then, in 1975, he appeared in his final role, playing a doorman in the musical romantic comedy "At Long Last Love".
Television.
By the late 1940s and early 1950s, programming in the rapidly expanding medium of television attracted the talents of many experienced personnel in the film industry, including Dorr. His earliest work on television was in two 1951 episodes of the televised crime drama Boston Blackie, starring Kent Taylor. Dorr's supporting role as Tommy in an episode of that series titled "Blind Beggar" is formally credited, although his other role in "Oil Field Murder" is uncredited. As with his film career, Dorr's 15 years of being cast in television series consisted predominantly of brief appearances on screen and portraying characters who had relatively few lines. Yet, his characterizations on television, like in films, were highly diverse and can be seen in at least 84 episodes of Westerns, crime and detective series, courtroom and hospital dramas, adventure programs, and sitcoms of the period. 
Examples of Dorr's television appearances can be viewed today in video copies of full episodes from classic series, as well as clips from related productions that are available online. Among those are his performances on "Bat Masterson" in 1960 (as a murdered Land Office Clerk in "Six Feet of Gold"), and on "The Jack Benny Program" in 1961. In a sketch in an episode titled "Main Street Shelter", he plays a weathered, finicky "patron" of a homeless shelter who complains that the facility has only doughnuts as free snacks and stresses his preference for cinnamon buns and crullers. Five years after that appearance on "The Jack Benny Program" and subsequent work on several other series, Dorr made his last television performance on the sitcom "Green Acres" in "I Didn't Raise My Pig to Be a Soldier". He has a considerable speaking part in that episode as "Mr. Collins", a local draft board official.
Personal life and death.
Dorr was married to Grace L. Painter, a native of Louisiana, Missouri. They were wed in Lucas, Ohio, on June 28, 1920 and remained together for 60 years, until Lester's death in Los Angeles in 1980. His remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.
Selected filmography.
As noted in his career profile, Dorr performed in hundreds of productions on stage, in films, and on television. The following is a sampling from a list of his screen appearances that is available in the catalog of the American Film Institute (AFI) in Los Angeles. Even that entire AFI list constitutes only a partial accounting of Dorr's performances:

IUCN Red List of Ecosystems

The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) is a global framework for monitoring and documenting the status of ecosystems. It was developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature for biodiversity risk assessment. Its main objectives are to support conservation, resource use, and management decisions by evaluating all the world's ecosystems by 2025.
The Red List of Ecosystem was developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the same entity that created the Red List of Threatened Species, a global framework to monitor the level of risk of animal and plant species.
With the help of RLE and its partner organizations, many governments and organizations create national and regional red lists, generally based on the IUCN categories and criteria, to classify the ecosystems under threat within their territorial limits.
History.
The Red List of Ecosystems was created to carry out assessments of biodiversity at a level of biological organization above species. Existing protocols developed by national or subnational authorities differed in focus and implementation, were often not comparable, and did not distinguish between strict risk analysis and the process of setting conservation priorities.
In 2008, during the IV World Conservation Congress (Barcelona, Spain), the process of developing criteria to estimate their risk status was activated and the IUCN laid the foundations for the creation of a Red List of Ecosystems (RLE). The initial development of the criteria for the List was based on analogies with the criteria for species and on existing protocols designed for regional applications.
In 2013, the process of creating The Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List Ecosystems, was finalized. That same year, "Scientific Foundations of an IUCN Red List of Ecosystems" was published to provide a consistent, practical and theory-based framework for establishing a systematic list.
The RLE was officially recognized by IUCN in 2014, to be managed as a Thematic Group under the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM).
The Red List of Ecosystems as a tool.
Like other IUCN products, the LRE provides an opportunity to facilitate the achievement of international conservation objectives and allows to assess an ecosystem's danger of collapse either globally or by portions developed over a region, country, or subnational entity.
This provides a means to make more effective territorial arrangements, minimizing the impacts from the anthropic transformations of large surfaces. It contributes to better management of the limited resources devoted to conservation. It prioritizes ecosystems with the most imminent chances of disappearing, focussing on them the greatest efforts to mitigate environmental threats, and create effective protected areas to safeguard them.
Categories and Criteria.
The basis of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems are the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria, a set of eight categories and five criteria that provide a consistent method for assessing an ecosystem's risk of collapse.
They are designed to be: broadly applicable across type ecosystems and geographic areas, transparent and scientifically rigorous, and easy to understand by decision makers and the public. The eight categories and the five criteria of the Red List of Ecosystems are:
Risk Categories.
The acronyms of the RLE risk categories (CO, CR, EN, VU, NT, LC, DD, NE) are in English and, unlike others, do not change in line with the language in which the document where they appear is written.
Collapsed (CO).
An ecosystem is Collapsed when it is virtually certain that its defining biotic or abiotic features are lost from all occurrences, and the characteristic native biota are no longer sustained. This category is only assigned when assessors are virtually certain (&gt;99% probability) of the assessment outcome, otherwise, if Collapsed is the more likely category, it should listed as Critically Endangered with upper bound of Collapsed.
Collapse is considered an endpoint of ecosystem decline and degradation and is thus the most extreme outcome of the risk assessment protocol. For this reason, this category must only be assigned when the evidence complies a very high standard. Unlike the analogous process of species extinction, collapse is theoretically reversible. In other assessment protocols, the terms 'extinct', 'eliminated' or 'disappeared' are often used instead of 'collapsed'.
Critically endangered (CR).
An ecosystem is Critically Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Critically Endangered. It is therefore considered to be at an extremely high risk of collapse. Formally this represents a 50% probability of collapse in a time frame of 50 years into the future (according to criterion E). In practice, this category is delimited by thresholds based on a compromise between theoretical and practical considerations: For criteria related to decline in ecosystem distribution (criterion A), degradation of abiotic environment (criterion C) and disruption of biotic interactions and processes (criterion D) the threshold values were set at high values for current and future declines (80%), and a higher value for historical declines (90%). For the assessment of restricted distribution (criterion B) the thresholds have been set following several simulation tests regarding the effect of spatially explicit threats on ecosystems with different spatial configurations.
Endangered (EN).
An ecosystem is Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered. It is therefore considered to be at a very high risk of collapse. Formally this represents a 20% probability of collapse in a time frame of 50 years into the future (according to criterion E). For criteria related to decline in ecosystem distribution (criterion A), degradation of abiotic environment (criterion C) and disruption of biotic interactions and processes (criterion D) the threshold values were set at intermediate values for current and future declines (50%), and a higher value for historical declines (70%). For the assessment of restricted distribution (criterion B) the thresholds have been set following several simulation tests regarding the effect of spatially explicit threats on ecosystems with different spatial configurations.
Formally an ecosystem is considered Endangered when there is a 20% probability of collapse in a time frame of 50 years into the future. In practice, this category is delimited by thresholds based on a compromise between theoretical and practical considerations, and might be considered artificial by some critics.
Some examples of endangered ecosystems are:
The term "endangered" has also been used in other contexts with similar meaning but slightly different definitions. A proposal of classification of Endangered Ecosystems of the United States considered the category "endangered" for ecosystems evidencing 85-98% decline. The Helsinki Commission used the category "endangered" to denote a heavy decline in distribution or quality of baltic habitats and biotopes.
Vulnerable (VU).
An ecosystem is Vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable. It is therefore considered to be at a high risk of collapse. Formally this represents a 10% probability of collapse in a time frame of 100 years into the future (according to criterion E). For criteria related to decline in ecosystem distribution (criterion A), degradation of abiotic environment (criterion C) and disruption of biotic interactions and processes (criterion D) the threshold values were set at low values for current and future declines (30%), and an intermediate value for historical declines (50%). For the assessment of restricted distribution (criterion B) the thresholds have been set following several simulation tests regarding the effect of spatially explicit threats on ecosystems with different spatial configurations.
Near Threatened (NT).
An ecosystem is Near Threatened when it has been evaluated against the criteria but does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for or is likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future.
Least Concern (LC).
An ecosystem is Least Concern when it has been evaluated against the criteria and does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened. Widely distributed and relatively undegraded ecosystems are included in this category. Theoretically, all ecosystems have some risk of collapse, just as all species face some risk of extinction. The term Least concern reflects the fact that this risk is relatively low. In practice this category is reserved for ecosystems that unambiguously meet none of the quantitative criteria (decline in distribution, restricted distribution, degradation of environmental conditions or disruption of biotic processes and interactions).
Data Deficient (DD).
An ecosystem is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of collapse based on decline in distribution, disruption of ecological function or degradation of the physical environment. Data Deficient is not a category of threat, and does not imply any level of collapse risk. Listing of ecosystems in this category indicates that their situation has been reviewed, but that more information is required to determine their risk status.
Not Evaluated (NE).
An ecosystem is Not Evaluated when it has not yet been evaluated against the criteria. The category of 'Not Evaluated' does not indicate that an ecosystem is not at risk from collapse, but simply that the ecosystem has not yet been studied for any risk to be quantified and published.
Criteria (A-E).
Two of the criteria for assigning ecosystems to a risk category evaluate the spatial symptoms of the ecosystem's collapse: decrease in distribution (A) and restricted distribution (B). Two evaluate the functional symptoms of the ecosystem's collapse: environmental degradation (C) and interruption of biotic processes and interactions (D). Multiple threats and symptoms can be integrated into an ecosystem dynamics model to produce quantitative estimates of the risk of collapse (E).
"The RLE risk categories acronyms (CO, CR, EN, VU, NT, LC, DD, NE) are in English and, unlike others, do not change in line with the language in which it is written. the document where they appear".
Adoption and application.
The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria and categories have been used in different contexts. There are examples of local, national and continental application. Some countries, like Finland, have adopted these guidelines as an official system to assess risk to ecosystems.
Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria.
The "Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria" are documents that help the correct application of the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, providing information on the development of the protocol and a detailed description of the scientific foundations that support the categories and criteria.
To date, two versions have been published:
Impacts, critique and challenges.
The development of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems considered tradeoffs between generality, precision, realism and simplicity. Conceptual and operational weaknesses of the RLE approach, categories, and criteria have been discussed and debated. A fair evaluation of it effectiveness and importance needs to consider its real achievements in conservation and natural resource management, a balance between benefits and limitations and its performance against alternative methods.
The Red List of Ecosystems is a relatively recent product, and it is still difficult to measure its medium and long-term impact. Overall investment has been modest compared to other, long standing conservation knowledge products, but its reception in public audiences and media has been positive. 
 It is considered a potentially important tool for creating indicators of progress of international policy, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals, but it is still lacking widespread implementation and adoption.
Some arguments against the wide adoption of the RLE are the lack of consistent means to classify ecosystems for assessing conservation status, technical difficulties with the concept of ecosystem collapse and lack of scientific basis for the criteria and thresholds. Classification and spatial representation of ecosystems is a major challenge in itself. While a standard taxonomy of organisms has existed for nearly 300 years, no consensus has yet been reached on principles for systematization of ecological diversity.
The concept of ecosystem collapse is still a major point of debate. Despite the strong empirical evidence, anticipating collapse is a complex problem. Although states of ecosystem collapse are often defined quantitatively, few studies adequately describe transitions from pristine or original state towards collapse.
Given the real need to evaluate risk to ecosystems and set national and regional conservation priorities, there is a clear advantages in using a flexible and standard approach that is comparable between regions and countries. This would save time and resources previously used to develop local guidelines, and would allow regions to share and compare experiences, and avoid common pitfalls.

School classification is the categorization of secondary schools by officially sanctioned bodies for athletic competition. Across North America, the classes have often been based on enrollment levels of the schools, with many leagues using classifications named A, AA, AAA, etc.
Classes.
Classification of secondary schools is performed by officially sanctioned bodies to attempt to provide an equitable grouping of potential talent for athletic competition. Across North America, the classes have often been based on enrollment levels of the schools, with many leagues using classifications named "A", "AA", "AAA", etc., with the number of "A"s denoting schools with larger enrollment, but alternative schemes are also employed. Schools may be placed in different classes for different sports (e.g., "A" for football and "AA" for baseball).

Combined Military Hospital Lahore

The Combined Military Hospital Lahore is the largest tertiary care teaching hospital operated by the Pakistan Army. Its primary function is to provide specialized medical treatment to Armed forces personnel, their dependents (immediate families), as well as the general public. It is headed by a Brigadier from the Army Medical Corps of the Pakistan Army.
History.
The hospital was established in 1854 as a British Military Hospital (BMH) by the British military as a specialized treatment center for British officers serving in the subcontinent. In 1927, the British military raised another hospital nearby named the Indian Military Hospital (IMH). The BMH and IMH served as treatment facilities for British troops and Indian troops serving the British respectively. It was not until 1943 that the British decided to amalgamate both hospitals into one contiguous unit (primarily due to administrative issues), and named it the Combined Military Hospital.
In 1947, after Pakistan's Independence, the Combined Military Hospital was handed over to the Pakistan Army. It was a 200-bed hospital at that time. The need for increasing medical facilities and the increasing population mandated several expansions of the hospital.
In 1982, its capacity was increased to 800 beds and was upgraded to a Class A hospital. It saw further expansion in 2004 with the addition of 200 more beds, increasing its capacity to 1000 beds. It is currently undergoing another expansion project which will be completed in 2020 and will overhaul the current hospital with the addition of 250 more beds.
Hospital facilities.
Being a Class A hospital, it serves as the principal medical hospital for armed forces personnel in the Lahore region. Although, the hospital's primary task is to cater military officers, soldiers, and their families; it provides equal healthcare facilities to civilians.
Some of the specialized healthcare units available in the hospital are:
Training / teaching facilities.
The hospital serves as a teaching hospital to CMH Lahore Medical And Dental College. Most of the clinical faculty of the medical college are doctors of the Army Medical Corps serving in the hospital.
It is also recognized by the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan for imparting FCPS training in the following departments:

The "Cohoes"-class net laying ships consisted of fifteen ships built near the end of World War II for the United States Navy, the last being commissioned shortly after war's end. They were similar in appearance and construction to the predecessor "Aloe" class, with slight differences in dimensions and displacement. Unlike previous net-laying classes, names were taken from a variety of place names, rather than from plants. All but two were decommissioned and put into reserve by the end of 1947, but most were reactivated at various times in the early 1950s and remained active until the early 1960s, when seven were transferred through lease or sale to several foreign navies. Two were transferred to other federal agencies; two were reactivated in the late 1960s and these served into the 1970s. Some of those transferred abroad were still active as late as 2007; none were lost in action.

Rountree is a neighborhood in central Springfield, Missouri. The neighborhood's borders are marked by Missouri State University to the west, Glenstone Avenue to the east, Catalpa Street to the south, and Cherry Street to the north. Rountree is predominantly residential, but is home to several popular restaurants, bakeries, and other businesses. The majority of homes in Rountree were constructed during the 1910s and 1920s. Architecture in the neighborhood is diverse, with many examples of Craftsman, Foursquare, and Federalist styles.
Rountree, like other neighborhoods in central Springfield, is markedly more liberal in its voting patterns than other parts of the city. This may be due to its close proximity to the Missouri State University campus.
The neighborhood's name derives from the N.M. Rountree Elementary School, located within the neighborhood on Grand Street. The school, in turn, is named the founder of the historic Keet-Rountree store in Springfield. The neighborhood hosts annual Fourth of July and Halloween parades that draw hundreds from around the city. Rountree is regularly ranked by 417 Magazine as among Springfield's best neighborhoods.

Barclays Bank plc v Quincecare Ltd

Barclays Bank plc v Quincecare Ltd [1992] 4 All ER 363 is a judicial decision of High Court of Justice of England and Wales in relation to the banker-customer relationship, and in particular in connection with the bank's duties in relation to payment instructions which give rise, or ought to give rise, to a suspicion of fraud.
Although the decision is cited most frequently in relation to the potential liability of a bank to their customer, in the case itself the bank was a claimant, and the customer and its guarantor were seeking to defend their own liability on the basis of the bank's breach of duty.
The decision attracted much comment, and the duty of banks outlined in the decision has come to be referred to as the "Quincecare" duty.
Although the case was decided in February 1988, it was not subsequently reported in any of the major law reports until 1992, and even then it was reported solely in the All England Law Reports and none of the official law reports. However the significance of the case was recognised by the judiciary much earlier; shortly after the decision was handed down it was extensively cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in "Lipkin Gorman (a Firm) v Karpnale Ltd" [1989] 1 WLR 1340 (overturned by the House of Lords on other grounds).
Facts.
The main facts of the case appear in the judgment. Barclays Bank agreed to lend £400,000 to Quincecare Ltd, a company formed specifically to purchase four chemists shops. The chairman of the company, Mr Harry Stiller, caused a sum of about £340,000 to be drawn down and to be misapplied for his dishonest purposes. Mr Stiller was later sentenced to four years' imprisonment, but almost the entire sum was lost. The bank then sued the company as principal debtor, and its guarantor (a company called UniChem). Both the principal debtor and the guarantor defended the claim, and put forward counterclaims. The central issues related to the question whether the bank acted in breach of duty towards either the principal debtor or the guarantor.
The trial judge, Steyn J summarised the principal issue as follows:
Decision.
The decision of the court was given by Steyn J. Having identified the central issue from the outset, much of the decision was a detailed review of the evidence to consider to what extent the bank knew, or ought to have known, of the fraudulent designs of Quincecare's chairman. This included a review of the dealings of the bank with Mr Stiller, and also consideration of expert evidence of the usual customs and practices of bankers.
Although the company and its guarantor advanced a number of different defences, all of which were addressed in the judgment, the most important aspect of the judgment in terms of jurisprudence was the decision in relation to whether or not the bank was in breach of its duty to its customer by failing to be alive to possible fraud, and the test laid down by the court to be applied. The judgment briefly reviewed the principal authorities, being "Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock (No 3)" [1968] 1 WLR 1555 and "Karak Rubber Co Ltd v Burden (No 2)" [1972] 1 WLR 602, and the more recent first instance decision in "Lipkin Gorman (a firm) v Karpnale Ltd" [1987] 1 WLR 987 (subsequently appealed after the decision in "Quincecare" was handed down).
In an oft-cited passage, Steyn J held that:
He went on to stress that "trust, not distrust, is also the basis of a bank's dealings with its customers", citing with approval similar comments from Bowen LJ in "Sanders Bros v Maclean &amp; Co" (1883) 11 QBD 327 at 343.
Accordingly, he dismissed the defences and counterclaims of the defendants and gave judgment for the bank in the amount of the loan, plus interest and costs.
Authority.
The decision in "Quincecare" has been broadly accepted as authoritative ever since it was handed down. It is recognised as authoritative by leading academic texts.
It was cited with approval almost immediately after it was decided by the Court of Appeal in "Lipkin Gorman (a Firm) v Karpnale Ltd" [1989] 1 WLR 1340, which is now the leading authority in this area of the law. It has also been cited with approval in various other cases including, , and .
Despite the consternation the decision caused, since "Quincecare" was decided there has been only one judicial decision in the United Kingdom where a bank has been held to be liable for breaching the "Quincecare" duty.

Gennaria griffithii

Gennaria griffithii is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native from Afghanistan to China. It is a terrestrial species, with a small tuber and small greenish flowers, found in damp places. It has a complicated taxonomic history, having been transferred between genera several times. When placed in a genus on its own it is correctly known as Dithrix griffithii. In 2015, it was transferred to the genus "Gennaria".
Description.
"Gennaria griffithii" is a terrestrial orchid, up to 17 cm tall. It has a small underground tuber, 20–30 mm in diameter. There are two or three leaves, 16–18 mm long by 7–14 mm wide. The inflorescence consists of a raceme of 7–12 flowers on a stem (scape) 12–16 cm tall. The flowers which appear in early April in their native habitat are greenish, 5–8 mm long, opening only slightly. The lateral sepals are fused at the base with the labellum, which is tri-lobed, the middle lobe being longer. A small spur is present, 1 mm long.
Taxonomy.
Nomenclature.
The nomenclature of this species is complicated, as was explained by Kanchi Gandhi and Paul Omerod in 2012. The species was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1890. He initially called it ""Habenaria decipiens", but later realized that this name had already been published for a different species, and so named it "Habenaria griffithii". In 1899, Friedrich Kraenzlin transferred "H. griffithii" to "Diphylax" as "Diphylax griffithii". In 1929, Károly Soó von Bere attempted to transfer the species to its own separate genus, under the name "Dithrix decipiens". This was doubly invalid, because the genus name "Dithrix" had not been validly published, and "griffithii" rather than "decipiens"" was the published epithet for the species. However, the invalid names were incorrectly included in various sources, including "Names in Current Use for Extant Plant Genera" published in 1993. This led to the "inadvertent validation" of "Dithrix" , although this was not understood until Gandhi and Omerod's paper in 2012. Unaware that "Dithrix" had been validated, Xiao-Hua Jin and De-Zhu Li published a new genus name and combination for the species, calling it "Nujiangia griffithii". However, this was a superfluous name. If Hooker's "Habenaria griffithii" is placed in a separate monotypic genus, then the name that should be used is "Dithrix griffithii" .
Phylogeny and classification.
"Gennaria griffithii" was known for a long time to be isolated within the original genus in which it was placed ("Habenaria"). In his original description, Hooker had proposed a separate section, "Habenaria" sect. "Dithrix", which later became the genus "Dithrix". Kraenzlin placed it in the genus "Diphylax" (now subsumed into "Habenaria"). Phylogenetic studies in 2012 and 2014 suggested that it was most closely related to "Gennaria", falling outside the main clades containing "Habenaria" species. This finding was initially used to justify placing "H. griffithii" in a monospecific genus as "Dithrix griffithii". In 2015, an alternative proposal was put forward, namely to move the species into "Gennaria". , this proposal has been accepted by sources such as the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, and Plants of the World Online.
A 2014 cladogram for the subtribe Habenariinae shows the two species now placed in "Gennaria" to be basal within one of the three main "superclades" (labelled C, D and E) making up the tribe:
Distribution and habitat.
"Gennaria griffithii" is native from Afghanistan through Pakistan and the western Himalayas into China (Yunnan). It is also found in south-west India. It typically grows along the banks of rivers.

Son of Pedro Alípio Alves de Camargo and Ismênia Marçallo de Camargo, grandson of the former governor of Paraná and descendant of the founder of Curitiba, bandeirante Baltasar Carrasco dos Reis.
He was vice governor of the state of Paraná, senator of the republic by the same state, besides federal deputy, elected in 1995, representing the people of Paraná.
Camargo Netto was a Candidate to the President of the Republic in 1989. His paternal family, formed by cattle ranchers and owners of refrigerators, had provided political pictures to the former Parana Republican Party. His grandfather, Affonso Alves de Camargo, was a state deputy for four terms (1898–1914), federal deputy (1921–1922), senator (1922–1927), and president of the State of Paraná twice (1916–1920) and 1928–1930) during the Old Republic.

Biography.
Civil Engineer graduated from the Federal University of Paraná in 1952, worked in the private initiative until approaching the then governor Ney Braga who named him successively director of the Department of Water and Electric Energy of Paraná and Secretary of Justice being elected deputy governor in 1964. Political opponent of Paulo Pimentel, changed the old Democratic Christian Party by the Brazilian Democratic Movement after the institution of bipartisanship by the military dictatorship in Brazil (1964–1985). Such political option made him break with Ney Braga being by this one derelict in the dispute to the Senate in 1966.
Later, Ney Braga and Paulo Pimentel broke up politically, and Afonso Camargo recomposed his alliance with his former political godfather, a fact that led him to the presidency of the State Bank of Paraná and to be Secretary of Finance (1973–1974). Elected president of the regional directory of the ARENA in 1975 was indicated [bionic position] in 1978. With the return of the multi-party system it followed towards the PP led by Tancredo Neves, whom he followed when he joined the PMDB. Secretary General of the party, was indicated in 1985 after the election of Tancredo Neves to the Presidency of the Republic and with the death of this one was kept in the portfolio by Jose Sarney. In this period, he created the vale-transporte and thus became known by the nickname of "the father of the transport valley". After leaving the government was reelected senator in 1986.
Afonso Camargo left the PMDB in the first year of his new term and was candidate to the presidency of the Republic in 1989, without passing the first shift. In the next round he supported the candidacy of Fernando Collor, whom he served again as Minister of Transport during the last months of his administration when he also held the Communications portfolio. He was elected federal deputy in 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006 and during that period he was affiliated with the PPR and the Liberal Front Party before joining PSDB in 2001.

Guild Hall of East Hampton

Guild Hall of East Hampton in the incorporated Village of East Hampton on Long Island's East End, is one of the United States' first multidisciplinary cultural institutions. Opened in 1931, it was designed by architect Aymar Embury II and includes a visual art museum with three galleries and the John Drew Theater, a 360 seat proscenium stage. It is historically significant for its role in exhibiting the works of the American Abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, John Ferren, and Robert Motherwell; performances by Helen Hayes, Thornton Wilder, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon, Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, and hundreds of other world-class stars of stage and screen; and involvement by the literary figures George Plimpton, Peter Matthiessen, Gore Vidal, Edward Albee, and John Steinbeck. It holds a permanent collection of 2,400 works of art and continues to build on important relationships in the worlds of film, theatre, dance, music, and visual art. The museum's current director is Andrea Grover, who was previously Curator of Special Projects of the Parrish Art Museum.
History.
Conceived of and mainly funded by the philanthropist Mrs. Lorenzo E. Woodhouse, Guild Hall opened to great fanfare on August 19, 1931 ("East Hampton has never known a celebration like that"), when 1,000 people crammed into the theater and gallery. The building site, on Main Street, was the former homestead of Samuel Miller, a farmer, between the First Presbyterian Church of East Hampton and Mulford Farm, a homestead which dates back to pre-Revolutionary War times.
As stated in the legal documents granting permission for the forming of Guild Hall, its mission has been, from the outset, to "encourage and cultivate a taste for music, drama, and the arts through the presentation of musical, dramatic and other intellectual and instructive opinions; to furnish galleries for art entertainments; for the exchange of and objects of historical interest; to furnish a meeting place for various organizations; in short to promote and encourage a higher type of citizenship".
Guild Hall's early trustees were predominantly members of the conservative social elite with token representation from the year-round community. Eventually, the "rebels in their own social set" persuaded the reluctant board to agree to a regional invitational visual arts show that would bring some of the most prominent artists of the day—as well as an embracing of more broad and avant garde criteria—to Guild Hall.
Visual arts.
In 1973, Guild Hall Museum was among the earliest institutions in the United States to receive formal accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums. Of the 35,000 museums nationwide, Guild Hall is still one of approximately 1,000 to hold this distinction. The museum mounts eight to ten exhibitions per year, including an East End–wide student art exhibition. One of two galleries at Guild Hall is named for its founder, Mrs. Lorenzo E. Woodhouse; another for the painter Thomas Moran, who is credited with "colonizing" the Village of East Hampton as an artists' community in the mid-19th century. The third, smallest, gallery is named for the East Hampton artist and collector Tito Spiga, whose bequest funded the building of the gallery upon his death in 1988.
There have been many notable artists of historical interest who have been exhibited at Guild Hall, such as Roy Lichtenstein, Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock, Childe Hassam, Franz Kline, Robert Dash, Fairfield Porter, Thomas Moran, and Robert Motherwell. In recent years, art by area artists who are also internationally celebrated has included that of Larry Rivers, Ross Bleckner, Eric Fischl, April Gornik, Miriam Schapiro, Esteban Vicente, Barbara Kruger, Audrey Flack, Elaine de Kooning, Andy Warhol, Dan Flavin, Elliott Erwitt, Hans Namuth, Julian Schnabel, and Jane Wilson.
Notable exhibitions.
17 Artists of Eastern Long Island: In 1949, the Board reluctantly agreed to the first Guild Hall regional invitational show, which installed works by Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Balcomb Greene and Nat Werner, among others. Attendance of the preview was one of the largest on record. The show coincided with an August 8, 1949, four-page spread in "Life" magazine, "Jackson Pollock: Is He the Greatest Living Painter in the United States?", which introduced Pollock to the world and solidified his role as an international sensation. Pollock and his wife, the artist Lee Krasner, had been living and working at their famed studio in Springs, outside the Village, since 1945, which is now the Pollock-Krasner House.
New Additions to the Guild Hall Permanent Collection: In 2014, the museum held a major exhibition of works of area artists that had recently been added to its permanent collection. The exhibit reflected "the abundance and diversity of artistic practice on the East End of Long Island" and was "a thought-provoking exhibition that beckons revisiting ...". Works by Jennifer Bartlett, Chuck Close, Carolyn Conrad, Robert Dash, Eric Fischl, Cornelia Foss, Ralph Gibson, April Gornik, Mary Heilmann, William King, Barbara Kruger, Thomas Moran, Costantino Nivola, Alfonso Ossorio, Betty Parsons, Clifford Ross, David Salle, and Carol Saxe were included.
Robert Motherwell: The East Hampton Years, 1944–1952: Curated by Phyllis Tuchman and accompanied by a book with the same title, the 2014 show of approximately 25 works brought together Motherwell’s fusion of gestural abstraction and Color Field painting, while also including some of his collages and published examples of his work as an editor.
Annual Artist Members Exhibition: First mounted in 1938, the sole criterion is membership in Guild Hall. The exhibit has been noted for its non-jury policy which, in an area historically known for the visual arts and its close proximity to New York City, creates a mix of "prestigious area professionals showing next to those less well known and hoping to be discovered".
Theater arts.
The John Drew Theater at Guild Hall produces more than 100 programs each year, including plays, concerts, dance performances, film screenings, simulcasts, and literary readings. It was posthumously named for the matinee idol John Drew Jr., a member of the Barrymore family who summered in East Hampton from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. The theater has an octagonal shape, a jewel-box proscenium stage, and a blue and white striped "trompe-l'œil" circus-tent ceiling that sweeps up to a chandelier of glass balloons.
In its early years, the theater served as a summer testing ground for productions en route to Broadway. Legendary playwrights such as Tennessee Williams and Eugene O’Neill credited Guild Hall with helping to establish their reputations, and Edward Albee had a lifelong relationship with the John Drew Theater, where he was an active member of the Guild Hall Academy of the Arts. Performers have included the Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Award–winning luminaries Alec Baldwin, Matthew Broderick, Blythe Danner, James Earl Jones, Patti LuPone, Wynton Marsalis, Liza Minnelli, Leslie Odom Jr., Audra McDonald, Laurie Metcalf, Mercedes Ruehl, Steve Martin, and Marlo Thomas; the dance companies Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, New York City Ballet, and Pilobolus; the performance artists Laurie Anderson and Meredith Monk; the directors Robert Wilson, Susan Stroman, Tony Walton, Harris Yulin, Bob Fosse, Gwen Verdon, and Julie Taymor; the jazz greats Winton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Sonny Rollins, Earl Klugh and Regina Carter; the comedians Jay Leno, Joy Behar, John Leguizamo, Jerry Seinfeld, and Martin Short; and the legendary musicians Mavis Staples, Patti Smith, Philip Glass, Billy Joel, and The Beach Boys.
The theater underwent a detailed renovation in 2007, supervised by the architect Robert A. M. Stern, restoring the original 1931 details while installing new AV and mechanical systems, digitized lighting controls, motorized rigging and moving lights, and upgraded technical booth. The tradition of providing a testing ground for artists to make work continues today with the John Drew Theater Lab. and a strong emphasis on developmental readings. The John Drew Theater's current artistic director, Josh Gladstone, has programmed and produced the performing arts programming at Guild Hall since 2000.
Notable productions.
The longest-running off-Broadway musical, "The Fantasticks", was produced at Guild Hall’s John Drew Theater before starting its historic New York run. Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron debuted "Love, Loss, and What I Wore" at Guild Hall before taking the play Off Broadway. Tennessee Williams's "The Glass Menagerie", starring Amy Irving and Ebon Moss-Bachrach, was the inaugural play after the two-year John Drew Theater renovation. Alec Baldwin and Laurie Metcalf starred in a strong revival of Arthur Miller's "All My Sons" in 2015.
Hamptons Film Festival.
Since the inception of the Hamptons International Film Festival (HIFF), Guild Hall has played a role in the festival. The theater screens films during the festival, as well as offering special programming and screening during the year in partnership with HIFF. Academy Award–winning films that have premiered at the festival and screened at Guild Hall have included "Gods and Monsters", "Black Swan", "Pollock", and "Moonlight".
Education and community.
Academy of the Arts.
Past recipients of the Academy of the Arts award have included the actor Lauren Bacall, the artist Paul Davis, and the author John Irving. The artist Eric Fischl is the current Academy of the Arts president. The academy has expanded its charter to support and mentor emerging artists with the mission of sustaining the legacy of the Hamptons as an arts colony with the Artist in Residence (AIR) program. 
Hamptons Institute.
The Hamptons Institute, originally formed in 2010 by board chairman Melville "Mickey" Straus, was revived by actor Alec Baldwin and institute director Tracy Marshall in 2016 to present a range of intellectual and professional perspectives on challenging issues and to engage in thoughtful debate and deliberation on subjects ranging from economics and business to politics and public policy, and from arts and culture to the role of the media. Panel discussions in recent years have featured panelists Amy Goodman, Nicholas Lemann, Bob Garfield, Jonathan Alter, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Dr. Paul Farmer, Elizabeth Warren, Van Jones, Ken Auletta, Katie Couric, John Podhoretz, and Monica Crowley.

Basilique Notre-Dame de Bonsecours

The Basilique Notre-Dame de Bonsecours (Basilica of Our Lady of Refuge) is a Gothic Revival basilica in Bonsecours near Rouen, Seine-Maritime, France. It is the first church in France to be built in the Gothic Revival style. The church is richly decorated, with the windows, sculptures and other elements often carrying the name or coat of arms of a donor.
Design.
The basilica's design and construction were carefully supervised by the Abbé Victor Godefroy (1799–1868), the Bonsecours parish priest, who chose the Gothic style and raised the funds.
Godefroy and the donors may have been drawn to this style from the time of Saint Louis (Louis IX of France: r. 1226–1270) because it represented a society they thought was organized on a Christian basis.
Godefroy had been a textile manufacturer before becoming a priest, and had experience with other building projects.
His fund raising efforts were helped by his close friendship with the future cardinal Gustave Maximilien Juste de Croÿ-Solre, archbishop of Rouen.
The architect Jacques-Eugène Barthélémy() may have had a background in engineering.
He had worked on partial reconstructions, but this was the first new church he had built.
It is not known who trained Barthélemy as an architect, but he had sketched churches around France, including Reims Cathedral.
He did not obtain approval for his design from the government's Conseil des batiments civils, which rejected Gothic designs for other proposed churches at the time.
He made his design before Eugène Viollet-le-Duc first published his Gothic architectural theories in 1844, and before the Corps des architectes diocésains was established in 1848.
History.
The Basilique Notre-Dame de Bonsecours is located in Bonsecours, to the southeast of the center of Rouen, on a site that commands a view over the Seine river.
It was built between 1840 and 1844, the first Catholic parish church built in Gothic Revival style.
The first stone was laid in a ceremony on 4 May 1840.
The first mass was celebrated on 15 August 1842 by 20,000 worshippers from the 14 parishes of Rouen. 
The building was completed in 1844.
Pope Pius IX granted the privilege of "coronation" on 15 July 1870, and the Cardinal Archbishop of Rouen crowned the Virgin on 24 May 1880.
Pope Benedict XV made the church a minor basilica on 28 March 1919.
In 1977 the basilica was inscribed in the inventory of historical monuments. 
On 24 August 2004 it was classified as a "monument historique".
Style.
Godefroy called the basilica's style "early Gothic with lancets, the purest period of the thirteenth century".
Unlike medieval church buildings that were built over a period of many years, the basilica has a consistent style throughout.
13th century features include flying buttresses, paired lancet windows, pinnacles, the bell tower, a gallery of statues and rose windows in the facade.
There are features drawn from the Sainte-Chapelle of Paris, built in the 1240s, which was being restored in the 1840s.
The plan of the church is akin to parish churches in Rouen of the 15th and 16th centuries, with the addition of a sacristy at the east end.
It has a nave and two wide aisles, but unlike 13th century churches it does not have a transept or an ambulatory.
John Ruskin, who hated modern Catholicism and French republicanism, described the church as,
Decoration and furnishings.
The extensive and coordinated decorations were part of a revival of religious art under the July Monarchy and include murals, sculpture, stained glass windows and liturgical furnishings.
All the interior surfaces of the basilica are painted, as with Sainte-Chapelle.
There are three chapels, dedicated respectively to Mary, Saint Joseph, and Saints Theresa and Joan of Arc.
The batismal font is set in a hexagonal marble structure created in Rouen in 1891.
The main altar is gilded bronze, made from chiseled metal to a design by Barthélemy.
A new altar was installed in the sanctuary in April 2006 made by Dominique Kaeppelin, sculptor at the Puy-en-Velay workshop.
The stalls were made by the Maison Kreyenbielh of Paris and installed in 1858.
There are four confessionals, made by Père Cahier.
The well-known glass artist Henri Gerente installed five windows in the apse in 1842.
Two of them are still in place.
Godefroy allowed the wealthy donors to pay for particular parts of the basilica, and to include their coat of arms and name or initials, either painted or engraved.
Many of the windows include portraits of the donor.
After Henri Barbet converted to Catholicism he and his wife donated two stained glass windows to the Basilique Notre-Dame de Bonsecours.
Barbet was mayor of Rouen and a wealthy textile manufacturer.
The front of the bell tower contains statues of the four evangelists.
Above the gable over the central door there is a statue of the Virgin Mary donated by Elie-Anne de Montmorency-Luxembourg.
Below this is a relief of Mary with the infant Jesus on her lap on the main tympanum flanked by two angels donated by Pascal Auguste Joseph Baudon de Mony, former Receiver-General.
In November 1857 Aristide Cavaillé-Coll delivered a new organ for the basilica, his first important work in Rouen.
It was inaugurated by Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély, the organist of La Madeleine, Paris, on 20 November 1857.
The buffet is neo-Gothic, in polychromatic oak, built to a design by father Arthur Martin.
In 1888–89 Cavaillé-Coll made various major improvements to the instrument, which was inaugurated on 7 November 1889 by Charles-Marie Widor of the Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris.
Further enhancements were made in 1928 and 1954.
The organ was classified as a "monument historique" in September 1997, and in 1999–2000 was largely restored to the 1889 version while retaining the 56-note keyboards and 30-note pedal.

Emma Amelia Cranmer

Emma Amelia Cranmer (previously, Emma Goodell; October 2, 1858 – January 11, 1937) was an American temperance reformer, woman suffragist, and author. A talented suffrage speaker and prohibition representative, she served as president of the South Dakota Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the South Dakota Equal Suffrage Association. Some of her epigrams were published by the press.
Early years and education.
Emma Amelia Powers was born in Mount Vernon, Wisconsin, October 2, 1858. She was the daughter of Dr. Joseph Lewis Powers and Janette S. (Byam) Cranmer. Her siblings were Julia C. Powers (born 1856), Laura B. Powers (born 1865), Fred Willard Powers (born 1868), and Leland Earnest Powers (born 1871).
She was educated in Cornell College.
Career.
She began to teach school when fifteen years old. In 1880, she married Delos N. Goodell, who died in 1882. In October, 1884, she married secondly, Hon. Simeon Harris Cranmer (1853–1943), a Nebraska teacher and lawyer. They made their home in Aberdeen, South Dakota in 1889, after he became president of the Union Banking Company. In the following year, the husband and wife established an industrial school for young woman who had jobs but did not have previous education, which included no-cost instruction in literature, mathematics, reading, and writing.
Cranmer wrote much for the press, both in prose and verse. Epigrams published by the press included, “Applause is like strychnine, it either acts as a tonic or a poison", “Drunkenness is a disease to be treated by the physician and not the policeman”, and “What is needed in our progress is more schools and fewer jails". She lectured on literary subjects and on temperance in many of the cities of the Northwest. As an orator she was eloquent and winning. She was an earnest worker in the white ribbon movement, with which she was connected for years, and served as president of the South Dakota Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In equal suffrage, she was profoundly interested, and served as president of the South Dakota Equal Suffrage Association. Through efforts of Cranmer and Anna R. Simmons, a bill was secured for a constitutional amendment from the South Dakota Legislature of 1893. In addition to Simmons, her contemporaries in South Dakota included, Irene G. Adams and Ida R. Bailey. On June 9, 1893, she attended the World's Temperance Congress in Washington D.C. and sat on the platform during the opening by Matilda Carse.
Personal life.
Cranmer became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church in her early childhood, and was a class-leader in her church. Later, she became a Christian Science practitioner.
She had one child, a daughter, Frances Willard Cranmer. Cranmer died January 11, 1937 in Minnesota, and is buried at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Shentu (deity)

Shentu () or Shenshu is one of the two door gods in Chinese mythology known as Menshen. It can found in an early text from "Shanhaijing". The gods were later incorporated into Taoism.
History.
The earliest mention of Shentu is from the Zhou Dynasty (1046 BC–256 BC). The other deity is Yulü. The two gods are responsible for supervising all spirits and stayed above the gate. Evil and harmful spirits were tied up and fed to tigers. The gods were believed to protect people from disasters, protect "fortunes and dispell evil influences". The oldest reference to the gods can be found in Classic Liji 禮記 "Book of Rites".
The story of Zhong Kui, the ghost fighter, which emerged during the Tang Dynasty was believed to help guard the gates as well.
During the Qing Dynasty, there was doubt of two door gods. Chinese scholar Yu Zhengxie believed there was only one god name Yulei (郁垒) or Tulei (荼垒).

Workplace robotics safety

Workplace robotics safety is an aspect of occupational safety and health when robots are used in the workplace. This includes traditional industrial robots as well as emerging technologies such as drone aircraft and wearable robotic exoskeletons. Types of accidents include collisions, crushing, and injuries from mechanical parts. Hazard controls include physical barriers, good work practices, and proper maintenance.
Background.
Many workplace robots are industrial robots used in manufacturing. According to the International Federation of Robotics, 1.7 million new robots are expected to be used in factories between 2017 and 2020. Emerging robot technologies include collaborative robots, personal care robots, construction robots, exoskeletons, autonomous vehicles, and drone aircraft (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs).
Advances in automation technologies (e.g. fixed robots, collaborative and mobile robots, and exoskeletons) have the potential to improve work conditions but also to introduce workplace hazards in manufacturing workplaces.[1] Fifty-six percent of robot injuries are classified as pinch injuries and 44% of injuries are classified as impact injuries. A 1987 study found that line workers are at the greatest risk, followed by maintenance workers, and programmers. Poor workplace design and human error caused most injuries. Despite the lack of occupational surveillance data on injuries associated specifically with robots, researchers from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) identified 61 robot-related deaths between 1992 and 2015 using keyword searches of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries research database (see info from Center for Occupational Robotics Research). Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, NIOSH and its state partners have investigated 4 robot-related fatalities under the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program. In addition the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has investigated robot-related deaths and injuries, which can be reviewed at OSHA Accident Search page. Injuries and fatalities could increase over time because of the increasing number of collaborative and co-existing robots, powered exoskeletons, and autonomous vehicles into the work environment.
Safety standards are being developed by the Robotic Industries Association (RIA) in conjunction with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).[2] On October 5, 2017, OSHA, NIOSH and RIA signed an alliance to work together to enhance technical expertise, identify and help address potential workplace hazards associated with traditional industrial robots and the emerging technology of human-robot collaboration installations and systems, and help identify needed research to reduce workplace hazards. On October 16 NIOSH launched the Center for Occupational Robotics Research to "provide scientific leadership to guide the development and use of occupational robots that enhance worker safety, health, and well being". So far, the research needs identified by NIOSH and its partners include: tracking and preventing injuries and fatalities, intervention and dissemination strategies to promote safe machine control and maintenance procedures, and on translating effective evidence-based interventions into workplace practice.
Hazards.
Many hazards and injuries can result from the use of robots in the workplace. Some robots, notably those in a traditional industrial environment, are fast and powerful. This increases the potential for injury as one swing from a robotic arm, for example, could cause serious bodily harm. There are additional risks when a robot malfunctions or is in need of maintenance. A worker who is working on the robot may be injured because a malfunctioning robot is typically unpredictable. For example, a robotic arm that is part of a car assembly line may experience a jammed motor. A worker who is working to fix the jam may suddenly get hit by the arm the moment it becomes unjammed. Additionally, if a worker is standing in a zone that is overlapping with nearby robotic arms, he or she may get injured by other moving equipment.
There are four types of accidents that can occur with robots: impact or collision accidents, crushing and trapping accidents, mechanical part accidents, and other accidents. Impact or collision accidents occur generally from malfunctions and unpredicted changes. Crushing and trapping accidents occur when a part of a worker's body becomes trapped or caught on robotic equipment. Mechanical part accidents can occur when a robot malfunctions and starts to "break down", where the ejection of parts or exposed wire can cause serious injury. Other accidents at just general accidents that occur from working with robots.
There are seven sources of hazards that are associated with human interaction with robots and machines: human errors, control errors, unauthorized access, mechanical failures, environmental sources, power systems, and improper installation. Human errors could be anything from one line of incorrect code to a loose bolt on a robotic arm. Many hazards can stem from human-based error. Control errors are intrinsic and are usually not controllable nor predictable. Unauthorized access hazards occur when a person who is not familiar with the area enters the domain of a robot. Mechanical failures can happen at any time, and a faulty unit is usually unpredictable. Environmental sources are things such as electromagnetic or radio interference in the environment that can cause a robot to malfunction. Power systems are pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical power sources; these power sources can malfunction and cause fires, leaks, or electrical shocks. Improper installation is fairly self-explanatory; a loose bolt or an exposed wire can lead to inherent hazards.
Emerging technologies.
Emerging robotic technologies can reduce hazards to workers, but can also introduce new hazards. For example, robotic exoskeletons can be used in construction to reduce load to the spine, improve posture, and reduce fatigue; however, they can also increase chest pressure, limit mobility when moving out of the way of a falling object, and cause balance problems. Unmanned aerial vehicles are being used in the construction industry to do monitoring and inspections of buildings under construction. This reduces the need for humans to be in hazardous locations, but the risk of a UAV collision presents a hazard to workers. For collaborative robots, isolation is not possible. Possible hazard controls include collision avoidance systems, and making the robot less stiff to lessen the impact force.
Hazard controls.
There are a few ways to prevent injuries by implementing hazard controls. There can be risk assessments at each of the various stages of a robot's development. Risk assessments can help gather information about a robot's status, how well it is being maintained, and if repairs are needed soon. By being aware of the status of a robot, injuries can be prevented and hazards reduced.
Safeguarding devices can be implemented to reduce the risk of injuries. These can include engineering controls such as physical barriers, guard rails, presence-sensing safeguarding devices, etc. Awareness devices are usually used in conjunction with safeguarding devices. They are usually a system of rope or chain barriers with lights, signs, whistles, and horns. Their purpose it to be able to alert workers or personnel of certain dangers.
Operator safeguards can also be in place. These usually utilize safeguarding devices to protect the operator and reduce risk of injury. Additionally, when an operator is within close proximity of a robot, the working speed of the robot can be reduced to ensure that the operator is in full control. This can be done by placing the robot in the manual or teach mode. It is also crucial to inform the programmer of the robot of what type of work the robot will be doing, how it will interact with other robots, and how it will work in relation to an operator.
Proper maintenance of robotic equipment is also critical in order to reduce hazards. Maintaining a robot insures that it continues to function properly, thereby reducing the risks associated with a malfunction.

Kyōji Saitō (齋藤 恭司, Saitō Kyōji; born 25 December 1944) is a Japanese mathematician, specializing in algebraic geometry and complex analytic geometry.
Education and career.
Saito received in 1971 his promotion Ph.D. from the University of Göttingen under Egbert Brieskorn, with thesis "Quasihomogene isolierte Singularitäten von Hyperflächen" (Quasihomogeneous isolated singularities of hypersurfaces). Saito is a professor at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences (RIMS) of Kyoto University.
Saito's research deals with the interplay among Lie algebras, reflection groups (Coxeter groups), braid groups, and singularities of hypersurfaces.
From the 1980s, he did research on underlying symmetries of period integrals in complex hypersurfaces. Saito introduced higher-dimensional generalizations of elliptic integrals. These generalizations are integrals of "primitive forms", first considered in the study of the unfolding of isolated singularities of complex hypersurfaces, associated with infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. He also studied the corresponding new automorphic forms. The theory has a geometric connection to "flat structures" (now called "Saito Frobenius manifolds"), mirror symmetry, Frobenius manifolds, and Gromov–Witten theory in algebraic geometry and various topics in mathematical physics related to string theory.
Saito supervised the thesis of 7 Ph.D. students at Kyoto University, including Hiroaki Terao and Masahiko Yoshinaga.
He was an Invited Speaker with talk "The limit element in the configuration algebra for a discrete group: a précis" at the International Congress of Mathematicians 1990 in Kyoto. In 2011 he was awarded the Geometry Prize of the Mathematical Society of Japan.

The Dirt (film)

The Dirt is a 2019 American biographical comedy-drama film directed by Jeff Tremaine from a screenplay by Rich Wilkes and Amanda Adelson, about heavy metal/glam metal band Mötley Crüe. The film stars Douglas Booth, Colson Baker, Daniel Webber and Iwan Rheon.
Talks of a Mötley Crüe biopic began as early as 2006, when Paramount Pictures and MTV Films purchased the rights to the book "The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band" by the band and Neil Strauss. However, the project then languished in development hell for over a decade, going through numerous directors and cast members before Netflix purchased the rights in March 2017. Filming began around New Orleans in February 2018.
"The Dirt" was released digitally on Netflix on March 22, 2019. It received generally negative reviews from critics, who said the film would please fans but that it hesitated "in handling the more troubling aspects of the band's history."
Plot.
In 1973, Frank Carlton Feranna Jr. walks away from his mother Deana after years of abuse and moves from Seattle to Los Angeles in 1978. After a failed attempt to connect with his biological father who abandoned the family at birth, Frank legally changes his name to "Nikki Sixx" in 1980. A year later, after a falling out with members of London at the Whisky a Go Go, Nikki befriends drummer Tommy Lee and reveals to him that he is forming a new band. Joining the band is guitarist Mick Mars, who suffers from ankylosing spondylitis. The trio then recruit Tommy's high school friend Vince Neil from the cover band Rock Candy as lead vocalist, and after some brainstorming, the quartet name themselves Mötley Crüe.
Despite being involved in a brawl with some crowd members, Mötley Crüe's first gig at the Starwood becomes well-received. They progressively sell out night clubs all over Los Angeles and rookie producer Tom Zutaut of Elektra Records approaches them with a five-album deal and they sign Doc McGhee as their manager. During their first national tour, the band is given advice by Ozzy Osbourne to know the limits of their partying before he snorts some ants and licks his and Nikki's urine on the pool floor. Before long, the band's albums go platinum and they each spend millions of dollars as fast as they earn them. Vince marries mud wrestler Sharise Ruddell, while Tommy announces his engagement to a woman named Roxie, but after his mother calls her a groupie, they get into a heated argument with Tommy punching Roxie in the face.
On December 8, 1984, during a party at Vince's home in Redondo Beach, California, Tommy meets Heather Locklear. Vince and Hanoi Rocks drummer Razzle drive out to buy more drinks and get into a car accident that kills Razzle and has Vince sentenced to 30 days in jail for vehicular manslaughter, which is subsequently reduced to 19 days. Nikki becomes addicted to heroin and starts to display destructive behavior towards his bandmates. He fires McGhee for bringing Deana to visit him. On December 23, 1987, shortly after Tommy and Heather's wedding, Nikki overdoses on heroin and is initially declared dead, but a paramedic who is a big fan of the band brings him back to life with two shots of adrenaline. Following this, Nikki has the band go to rehab. A sober Mötley Crüe rebounds in 1989 with "Dr. Feelgood", which becomes their first number one album on the Billboard 200, followed by a lengthy world tour. The months of touring and staying sober take their toll on Vince and Tommy, who resort to drinking again after being away from their families for too long.
Following the tour, Vince discovers that Sharise and their daughter Skylar have left him, causing him to miss several rehearsals and eventually part ways with the band in 1992. The band then hires John Corabi as his replacement. In 1995, Skylar dies of stomach cancer at the age of four. Heather divorces Tommy after he is caught having an affair with a porn star. Seeing the backlash by fans over Vince's departure from the band, Nikki negotiates with Zutaut to give them back the rights to their songs in exchange for their release from Elektra Records. After visiting his father's grave, Nikki regroups with Tommy and Mick, who has had hip surgery, before they reconcile with Vince. Mötley Crüe would perform together for another 20 years, playing their final show on New Year's Eve 2015.
Cast.
The real Mötley Crüe appear in archival footage during the ending credits.
Production.
In 2006, film adaptation rights to the autobiography book "The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band", authored by Neil Strauss with Tommy Lee, Mick Mars, Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx, were bought by Paramount Pictures and MTV Films. At the time, Larry Charles was tapped to direct the film. However, production on the film stalled and in 2008 Sixx spoke of his frustration in an interview stating:
In November 2013, Jeff Tremaine signed on to helm "The Dirt", with the film having been dropped by MTV Films and Paramount Pictures. In January 2015, Focus Features picked up rights to the film. However, production languished in development hell until March 2017, when Netflix bought worldwide rights to the film. At the time, Liam Hemsworth, Emory Cohen and Douglas Booth were being eyed for lead roles in the film. In November 2017, Booth officially signed on to star in the film. In January 2018, Machine Gun Kelly, Iwan Rheon and Daniel Webber joined the cast. In February 2018, Tony Cavalero joined the cast. In March 2018, Rebekah Graf, Leven Rambin, and David Costabile joined the cast.
Principal production commenced in February 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Accident.
On March 11, 2018, Louis DiVincenti, a rigging grip for the production team, suffered an electric shock while de-rigging a set during the New Orleans shoot. According to DiVincenti, he was passing metal pipes to other crew members when one pipe he held made contact with a nearby power line, causing an electrical current that arced through his body and blew out through his right foot. As a result, he sustained second- and third-degree burns over 50 percent of his body, which required numerous surgeries and skin grafts, and his right foot had to be amputated. On March 1, 2019, DiVincenti sued Netflix and Mötley Crüe for $1.8 million to compensate for his medical bills.
Marketing.
The trailer was released on February 19, 2019 and featured glimpses of some of the stories including the infamous hotel television throwing incident, Vince Neil's vehicular manslaughter charges in 1984, and Nikki Sixx's drug overdose in 1987.
Critical reception.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 4.65/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""The Dirt" celebrates the rude debauchery that Mötley Crüe's fans enjoy -- but does so with the dispiriting lack of substance that the group's critics have long decried." On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "general unfavorable reviews".
David Fear of "Rolling Stone" gave the film a rating of two out of five stars, saying that "This is rock bad-boy lore as a rocking bore, an endless parade of recreated afterparty ecstasy and emptiness that robs "The Dirt" of the vicarious thrill it had on the page — the sense that you shouldn’t be having this much of a second-hand high reading about musicians acting like horrible people but still seeming living-the-dream heroic." Owen Gleiberman of "Variety" called the film "a thinly written, generically staged VH1-style sketchbook of a movie — which is to say, it's a Netflix film, with zero atmosphere, overly blunt lighting, and a threadbare post-psychological telegraphed quality that gives you nothing to read between the lines." Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film one out of four stars, saying that "You could listen to "Dr. Feelgood" two full times during the run time of "The Dirt" and learn just about as much about the band as you do in this R-rated Wikipedia article of a movie. And you'd have way more fun."
Chris Nashawaty of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the film a B, saying that "This movie won't win any awards. Nor should it. But for two hours it's a nostalgic blast to sit back and revel in the idiocy of these glorious, big-haired jackasses." Rafer Guzmán of "Newsday" gave the film three out of four stars, calling it "a funny, foul-mouthed, whirlwind ride through one of the last great eras in rock history, when wretched excess was part of the job description and bad behavior was a badge of honor."
Soundtrack.
"The Dirt Soundtrack" was released by Mötley Records and Eleven Seven Records on March 22, 2019, on CD, LP, and digital formats.

Lillian Holland Harvey

Lillian Holland Harvey (1912–1994) was an American nurse, educator and doctor known for her contributions to medical education. She was an activist for the equal rights of African Americans. Harvey's accomplishments were achieved at a time in history when both African Americans and women faced extreme discrimination in academics and the medical field. She was seen as a leader in her community and led a successful professional and personal life.
Education and career.
Harvey was an African American woman born in the town of Holland, Virginia. After graduating from high school she moved to New York to attend the Lincoln Hospital School of Nursing. Harvey received her nursing diploma in 1939, going on to study at Columbia University where she eventually graduated and earned her bachelor's degree in the year 1944. Her dedication to further her own knowledge as well as teaching others led to the completion of a master's at Columbia University's Teachers College in 1948. Later, she re-enrolled at Columbia to receive her doctorate degree in 1966.
Established in September 1892, Tuskegee School for Nurses was a historically black nursing school that offered only a three-year nursing program beginning 1908. Harvey became director of nurse training in 1945 and in 1948 became Dean. In 1949 she initiated a process of turning the diploma program into a baccalaureate program. It would be the first of its kind in the state of Alabama. In 1953 nursing students were now able to receive a Bachelor's of Science in Nursing. The program was fully accredited by the National League for Nursing in 1957. Within the program, students could gain hands on experience both in their home state at the John A. Andrew Hospital as well as outside, which included medical practices in Massachusetts, Florida, New York, and Connecticut. Harvey served as the Dean of Nursing at Tuskegee Institute for twenty five years before retiring in 1973. After retirement she was active in the National Negro Business and Professional Women's club. In addition to this, Harvey went on to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the National League for Nursing. She was involved in multiple distinguished organizations including American Red Cross, the Kellogg Foundation, and the American Journal of Nursing Company. Harvey was also an advisor in the U.S. Public Health Service's committee for Professional Traineeships.
Accomplishments.
Throughout her career and afterwards Harvey received much accolade for her contributions. She was a recipient of the Mary Mahoney Award from the American Nurses Association National Awards Program in 1982 and in 1992 the Tuskegee University Board of Trustees named the Nurses Home “Lillian Holland Harvey Hall” in Harvey's honor. In 1999, Harvey was elected into the Alabama Healthcare Hall of Fame. She was also a 2001 Alabama Nursing Hall of Fame Inductee and the Alabama State Nurses' Association had an award set up in her name.
Civil rights.
Harvey was involved in civil rights activism and desegregation. During WWII, she used her position as the Dean of the Tuskegee School for Nurses to train black nurses for military service and created opportunities for them to enter the Army Nurse Corps. She worked to desegregate the Alabama Nurses’ Association by attending their meetings, an 80-mile drive from Tuskegee to Montgomery and at these meetings, she was required to sit in a separate section. Despite this discrimination, she still made her voice prominent in these meetings and advocated for nurses and nursing students.
Harvey was also a member of the education committee of the President's Commission for the Status of Women (PCSW). The PCSW, founded by Esther Peterson during the Kennedy administration, focused on the changing social roles of American women in the 1960s regarding employment, home and family life, and civil and political rights143. Peterson ensured that black women were included in the Commission; however, Harvey was the only African American woman on the education committee. The primary purpose of the education committee was to discuss social concerns such as “the need for day care, the value of volunteers, the nature of women’s home life, and preparation for female adulthood." Specifically, Harvey advocated for the improvement of urban settings, and wanted “the African American community to support its own needs."
Personal life.
Harvey was married to Baptist minister Reverend Raymond Francis Harvey and together they had three children. Harvey died in 1994 at the age of eighty-two, just two years after her husband.
Legacy.
Harvey's leadership impacted the lives of many young African Americans and her dedication as Dean of Nursing influenced progression towards equal opportunity in both education and civil rights.

The album peaked at No. 177 on the "Billboard" 200.
Critical reception.
"Trouser Press" called "The Right to Be Italian" "a new wave classic of romantic ups and downs, leather-jacket rebellion and kitsch culture, carried mightily on Vincent’s tough-girl attitude, full-throated singing, gale-force Brill Building melodies and chunky rhythm guitar presence." "The Rough Guide to Rock" deemed the album "a lost masterpiece."
Track listings.
All songs written by Holly Beth Vincent, except where indicated
Other editions.
There is a 2010 Japanese CD reissue that preserves the original track order for the tracks from the original album, but with the same bonus tracks, in the same order, as the 2002 reissue.

Sarah Vasen

Sarah Vasen (May 21, 1870 Quincy, Illinois – August 21, 1944 Glendale, California) was the first Jewish female physician specializing in gynecology and obstetrics to practice in Los Angeles. 
Education.
Until age 16, Vasen attended public school in Quincy. After finishing her public school education, Vasen began studying with Dr. Melinda Knapheide-Germann. Knapheide-Germann was one of the first female doctors to practice medicine in Quincy. Vasen trained with Knapheide-Germann for the next two years. 
In 1890, Vasen began studying medicine at the Keokuk College of Medicine. Keokuk was the first coeducation American medical college specializing in gynecology and obstetrics practices. She graduated on March 8, 1892, the first Jewish female graduate in the college history. 
In 1897, Vasen enrolled in postgraduate training in obstetrics in Philadelphia. During this time, Vasen began a physician and then the superintendent at the Jewish Maternity House. 
Medical career.
Upon graduation, she moved back to her hometown of Quincy, Illinois and in 1902 became attending gynecologist at Quincy's Blessing Hospital. Vasen had spent her life invested in the Jewish community, and in 1898 she accepted a position as a physician and superintendent at Philadelphia's Jewish Maternity Home. 
In 1904, Vasen made the decision to move to California and there she continued her medical career. Upon arrival in California, she began working as a physician and supervisor at Kaspare Cohn Hospital. She was the second Jewish female to practice medicine in California. Vasen was the first Jewish female to hold a supervising position and a position as a physician at Kaspare Cohn. She was recognized publicly for her incredibly efficient and careful work at Kaspare Cohn. 
Vasen enjoyed her work as an OBGYN and supervisor, but in 1910 she decided to take a different route. She opened a private maternity clinic which she ran successfully for many years. Vasen also spent much of her time volunteering her services to help the poor Jewish community. She was very active in the Jewish community and the Los Angeles community as a whole. 
Vasen retired from her medical career in 1915, shortly after her marriage to Saul Frank.
Work in the Jewish community.
Sarah Vasen was raised in a Jewish home and Jewish community. She devoted her medical career to the underprivileged in the Jewish community of Los Angeles, specifically the women and children. Vasen contributed a great deal to the Jewish community when she served as a physician and superintendent at Philadelphia's Jewish Maternity Home in the years following her graduation from medical school. The Jewish Maternity Home was a place for Jewish immigrants seeking medical care, but that were too poor to afford it anywhere else. 
Sarah Vasen also devoted her time to the education of the Jewish community. She was a prominent figure in the Jewish religious school for children. Vasen, then residing in Glendale, took part in organizing a religious school for the children of the town's Jewish community. 
Personal life.
Vasen was the only daughter of Gerson (George) Vasen and Catherine Eschner Vasen out of nine children. Originally residing in Illinois, Vasen moved to Philadelphia for a few brief years before relocating to Los Angeles in 1905. 
Vasen became interested in obstetrics and gynecology at a very young age. Vasen was exposed to pregnancy and raising children because her mother had nine children. Women choosing a career in the medical field was uncommon at this time. 
In 1911, Vasen met Saul Frank, a newly retired businessman. The couple married in 1915 and settled in Glendale. Frank died of a heart attack on August 24, 1924, Vasen never remarried. 
Vasen died on August 21, 1944 from complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was buried in East Los Angeles in Home of Peace Memorial Park.

Conversational commerce

Conversational commerce is e-commerce done via various means of conversation (live support on e-commerce Web sites, online chat using messaging apps, chatbots on messaging apps or websites, voice assistants) and using technology such as: speech recognition, speaker recognition (voice biometrics), natural language processing and artificial intelligence.
Development.
WeChat in China.
During this time, in China, e-commerce via WeChat – at its core a messaging app, but also letting merchants display their goods in mobile Web pages and via social feeds – grew strongly. By 2013 e-commerce in China had overtaken that of the U.S.
Facebook Messenger.
In 2016, Facebook announced its Facebook Messenger chatbot platform, heralding the arrival of conversational commerce via the most widely used messaging app in the world outside China. More than 34,000 businesses had opened shop on Messenger by August 2017.
Early cited examples of conversational commerce chatbots on Facebook Messenger include 1-800-FLOWERS with an IBM Watson artificial intelligence-powered chatbot/assistant, and Mexican airline Aeroméxico, whose chat platform running on Yalochat lets customers search, book, track, or check in for flights; ask any question, using A.I. and NLP to provide answers; or pull the chatbot into a group chat.
Apple Business Chat.
In June 2017, Apple announced its Apple Business Chat product, allowing consumers and businesses to message each other via the Messages app.
WhatsApp.
In September 2017 WhatsApp announced the pilot of its new Enterprise solution, the first time large companies would be able to attend to large groups of customers in an approved WhatsApp solution, after WhatsApp banned earlier unofficial solutions. Companies who piloted the solution included airlines Aeromexico, KLM, Latin American online travel agency Despegar and online retailer Linio.
Enterprise solutions for Whatsapp have been available since 2015 from a variety of third-party vendors, and though unofficial, they have been used by major companies and governments including the Governments of Colombia and Costa Rica.
Podium.
In March of 2020, Podium announced a contactless payment solution allowing local businesses to accept payments through two-way SMS text message conversations with customers. Outside of traditional instore card-present transactions, there existed only a few options for businesses to accept payments, most of which were not secure, PCI compliant, or convenient. Through Podium Payments, businesses can engage with customers and securely close sales all within the same convenient channel.
Telegram.
In May 2017 Telegram supported basic payments in chats using bots and in April 2021, the payment 2.0 that supports payment in more than 200 countries via integration with 9 different payment providers. 
Alexa and Google Assistant.
Both Amazon and Google are providing APIs to enable payment via voice chat using stored payment credentials in Google Pay or Amazon Pay.
Web chat.
Although, they don't have any functionalities to facilitate actual transactions within the conversation, companies like LiveChat Software, CM.com, and LivePerson have powered live conversations between customers and live agents as far back as the 2000s, before retail businesses used messaging apps to communicate with customers.

Alessia Zecchini

Alessia Zecchini (born 30 June 1992, Rome, Italy) is an Italian freediver who set world and Italian records in free diving.
At the age of 13, she completed her first federal apnea course in A.s.d. "Apnea Blu Mare". In 2009 she changed clubs and became an athlete of Dive Free Roma and Nuoto Belle Arti.
Since 2012, she has been part of the indoor and outdoor Italian national freediving team, so far winning sixteen gold medals, five silver and two bronze at the World Championships and three golds, six silvers and one bronze at the European Championships.
She is currently the "deepest woman in the world" with her −113 m in constant weight (monofin), achieved in August 2019 during the World Championship in Roatán, Honduras.
On 18 October 2019 she became the first woman to have reached a depth of −100 m exclusively with the use of her arms (free immersion), during the “Nirvana Oceanquest” in Curacao.
Background.
Alessia Zecchini was born in Rome on June 30, 1992. 
Attracted to the sea from an early age, at the age of 13, she completed her first federal apnea course in the A.s.d. "Apnea Blu Mare", immediately showing a natural ability. In order to compete at the highest level of freediving, she had to comply with the then federal regulations and wait until she reached 18 years of age. Despite this, she was called to rallies with the national team, thanks to the “Talent Project" started by Maurizio Bellodi, even before she began to compete. In 2009 she changed clubs and joined both Dive Free Rome and Nuoto Belle Arti Roma, the historic fin swimming club where she trained. Since 2010 she has been under the guidance of Andrea Laureti and, in that year, she participated in her first two competitions, where she qualified for the subsequent Italian Championships. In 2011 she participated in her first Italian championship in Turin, winning two silver medals. In 2012 she debuted with the national team. 
In 2017 she began her outdoor training with international coach and safety diver Stephen Keenan, who died prematurely after a few months. Subsequently, she was under the guidance of Martin Zajac up until the conclusion of the 2018 competition season. 
Since 2020 she has entrusted Gianfranco Concas to be her technical guide for outdoor disciplines and continues her athletic and indoor training with Andrea Laureti.
Career.
From 2007 to 2010 she attended in rallies with the national team, although she could not compete in the top category due to her young age.
In 2011 she participated in her first Italian championship in Turin, taking the podium in second place, behind Ilaria Bonin. The placings achieved also in the following year earned her the call to be part of the national team. In 2012 she participated in her first CMAS European Championship in Antalya, achieving good placings (fourth place in Jump Blue and sixth in static apnea).
In 2013, during the CMAS World Championship in Kazan, she won the gold medal in static freediving (STA) with a time of 6' 23", then obtained a medal in every discipline, including a silver in dynamics without fins (DNF) and a bronze in dynamic with monofin (DYN).
At the Italian Depth Championship in Ischia, she achieved her first CMAS world record in constant weight with the monofin (CWT) with −81 m.
In 2014, she participated in her first AIDA competition, the Team World Championship in Cagliari, winning three silver medals in dynamic apnea with the monofin with 223 m, in static apnea with the time of 6' 39", in constant weight with a depth of −84 m and setting two Italian records. At the CMAS European Championship held in Tenerife, she won the silver medal in dynamic apnea with monofin (DYN) with 218 m, and third place in the static apnea competition with a time of 6' 08".
During the Italian depth championship in Ischia, she achieved her second CMAS world record in constant weight with the monofin (CWT) with −86 m.
In 2015 she took part in the CMAS Indoor World Championship in Mulhouse and, together with her partner Ilaria Bonin, they won five gold and silver medals. Alessia won the competition in dynamics without fins (DNF) with 165 m, also setting the CMAS world record. In that same competition she also won two silvers (DYN with 234 m and STA with a time of 6'35"). During the Outdoor World Championship in Ischia, organised by the Italian Federation of Sport Fishing and Underwater Activities, she won three gold medals with relative world records: in constant weight with monofin (CWT) with −93 m, in constant weight without tools (CNF ) with −58 m and in jump blue (JB) with 190 m. Once again, in June 2016 in Lignano Sabbiadoro, during the CMAS Indoor World Championships: three golds and three CMAS world records with 171 m in dynamics without fins, 204 m in dynamics with fins (DYNBP) and 250 m in dynamics with monofin (DYN ). 
The year 2017 crowned Alessia Zecchini as "the deepest woman in the world", after conquering the AIDA world record with −104 m depth in the Vertical Blue competition on May 10 on Long Island in the Bahamas. During the last days of the competition, Natalia Molchanova's record in constant weight (CWT) of −101 m (which had been held for six years), was beaten three times. On May 6, a historic day, Alessia was the first to go down and take off the tag at −102 m; breaking the world record. Four days later, Hanako Hirose dropped to −103 m but Alessia Zecchini was not deterred and only minutes later went on to detach the tag at −104 m, setting yet another world record.
A month later, she participated in the CMAS European Indoor Championship in Cagliari swimming pool where she won three medals out of the three competitions (first place in DYN, second in DNF and second in DYNBP). In August of the same year, she participated in the AIDA World Championships in Roatan where she became world champion in free-immersion setting a new Italian record at −88 m and vice world champion in constant weight with monofin with −98 m. A disqualification denied her the silver medal even in constant weight without fins. In October, at the CMAS European Championship in Kaş, Turkey, she won two silver medals in CWT and CNF with −93 m and −63 m, a new Italian record. Also in the same year, during the Dungoncup in Milazzo she achieved the world record in dynamic apnea without fins with 181 m.
In 2018 Alessia reconfirmed herself as the deepest woman in the world, setting the new AIDA world record in constant weight (CWT) on 10 May in San Andrès in Colombia in the Nirvana Oceanquest Freediving Competition. A month later, at the Indoor World Championships in Lignano Sabbiadoro, she won two silver medals in DYN and DNF and a gold medal in the bi-fin discipline where she set the new world record with 221 m. In July, in Long Island, in the prestigious Vertical Blue competition, she confirmed herself as the strongest freediver by winning the overall and setting four world records AIDA in all depth disciplines: – Constant weight without fins with −73 m, Free immersion with −93 m and then −96 m and Constant weight with monofin with −107 m. 
In September of the same year she participated in the Dugoncup Outdoor in Milazzo setting two other world records in CWT (−101 m) and FIM (−89) but this time under the aegis of CMAS, before flying to the first edition of the Molchanova Gran Prix in memory of Natalia Molchanova, winning the competition. She participated in the CMAS Outdoor World Championship by winning three golds in the three competitions held, CWT, CNF and FIM where she set four CMAS world records, bringing the WR in constant weight with CMAS and AIDA to the same depth of −107 m.
In April 2019, during the Dungoncup in Milazzo, she again set the world record in dynamic free diving without fins with 193 m.
In June 2019 she participated, together with the Italian National team, in the CMAS Indoor European Championship in Istanbul, winning two gold medals with relative world records, 228 m in dynamics with fins and 253 m with monofin, and a silver medal in dynamics without fins.

Teal organisation

A Teal organization is an organizational theory that advocates enabling workers' self-management and to adapt as an organization grows. It was introduced in 2014 by Frederic Laloux in his book on Reinventing Organizations. It also rests on previous studies done by evolutionary and social psychologists including Jean Gebser, Clare W. Graves, Don Edward Beck, Chris Cowan and Ken Wilber who explored the stages of development and impact of human consciousness.
Overview.
A Teal organization is defined by the three following ideas in contrast to the paradigms of Amber, Orange and Green organizations:
The paradigm is that an organization is similar to an organism in that the inner biology of the organism operates autonomously to sustain its health. This includes adapting to change, enabling employees to bring all their skills to the organization and to do so without direct leadership.
Examples.
A number of notable organizations around the world have adopted and operate with the Teal organization model some of which are in the table below:

Kuang Li-chen

Kuang Li-chen (; born 12 March 1963) is a Taiwanese politician.
She was married to Wu Chun-li, who was elected to the Taitung County magistracy in 2005. Wu was suspended immediately after inauguration on charges of corruption and subsequently divorced Kuang so she could run for his post in her own right, as Taiwanese law forbid the appointment of spouses or other relatives as a magisterial deputy. Kuang joined the Kuomintang and won the Taitung magisterial by-election in April 2006, over three independent candidates. During her term, broadband internet access was installed throughout Taitung County. During the transitional justice referendum of 2008, she was a proponent of two-step voting, in which voters mark one ballot for political candidates before receiving a separate ballot for referendum questions.
Kuang presided over the eighth Festival of Austronesian Culture and the Taitung portion of the 2007 Wan-an exercise, an annual air-raid drill. She became well-known for promoting tourism to Taitung County. Kuang was often abroad, and, when Typhoon Fung-wong hit Taiwan in July 2008, she was criticized for remaining in Italy on junket. Shortly after an investigation into her travels led by the Kuomintang's Evaluation and Discipline Committee began in August 2008, Kuang met with the Taitung County Prosecutors' Office for questioning. It was found that Kuang spent over NT$10 million on eight junkets abroad since taking office as magistrate. The Kuomintang suspended her party membership in August 2008. The Taitung Prosecutors' Office continued investigating Kuang into January 2009. Later that month, the Control Yuan impeached her, after choosing not to do so in December 2008.
Throughout 2009, Kuang ranked low in performance polls run by the "China Times" and "Global Views". Despite losing a KMT primary to Justin Huang in May 2009, she was expected to campaign for a full term in that year's magisterial elections. In October, a month after the Taitung District Prosecutors Office stated that Kuang would not be indicted on corruption charges, she announced that she would support Huang's magisterial candidacy. Speculation that the Kuomintang had offered to nominate Kuang or Wu Chun-li to contest Huang's vacant legislative seat if Kuang withdrew from the magisterial election soon arose. The Kuomintang chose to run polls that would decide the nomination. Kuang registered for the election before poll results were revealed, managing to win the Kuomintang's support because her opponent was deemed ineligible to contest the nomination. Kuang faced Democratic Progressive Party member Lai Kun-cheng in the legislative election, and lost. The Central Election Commission released a list of candidates contesting the Taitung magistracy on 31 August 2018, which included Kuang. After the Kuomintang expelled her on 28 September, Kuang chose to remain in the race as an independent candidate.

Newfoundland Growlers

The Newfoundland Growlers are a professional minor league ice hockey team in the ECHL based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. The team began play in the 2018–19 ECHL season with home games at Mile One Centre. They are members in the North Division of the Eastern Conference and are affiliated with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League and Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League.
History.
The search for a new professional hockey team for St. John's began after the departure of the St. John's IceCaps of the American Hockey League. In July 2016, the Montreal Canadiens, who owned the franchise used by the club, confirmed the relocation of the team to the newly constructed Place Bell arena in Laval, Quebec, for the start of the 2017–18 season. Danny Williams, who ran the IceCaps and owned the team's intellectual property, stated his intentions to find another franchise with the AHL or another league.
From that point two rival groups formed. The first were the operators of the St. John's Edge basketball team and current occupants of the Mile One Centre, who looked to secure a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League franchise for the arena. The other, led by local businessman Dean MacDonald and including ice hockey executive Glenn Stanford of the former IceCaps, were looking to secure an ECHL team.
The ECHL franchise was conditionally approved for the Stanford-led group pending an arena deal but was delayed in late January 2018 after a dispute with the St. John's Edge ownership group over arena rights that led to arbitration. After the lease issue was settled, the ECHL officially approved St. John's for entry into the league on March 13, 2018, to begin with the 2018–19 season, placing them in the North Division of the Eastern Conference. The ECHL ownership group reportedly created a partnership with the Toronto Maple Leafs, which would bring the organization back to St. John's for the first time since the team relocated their American Hockey League affiliate, the St. John's Maple Leafs, to Toronto in 2005. The affiliation would eventually be confirmed on June 14. Among the names considered for the new franchise were Shamrocks, Storm, Regiment, and Newfoundland Growlers. The team announced its name as the Newfoundland Growlers on May 22, the name in reference to the Newfoundland dog, specifically the World War I mascot of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, Sable Chief. Ryane Clowe, a Newfoundland native, previously an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils, was named head coach on June 20. John Snowden was added as assistant coach on July 19 after serving in the same capacity for the Maple Leafs' previous ECHL affiliate, the Orlando Solar Bears.
The Growlers played their first game on October 12, 2018, a 3–2 win over the Florida Everblades in front of a sold-out arena. In January 2019, Clowe stepped down due to health concerns and was replaced by assistant coach John Snowden. The Growlers finished the season in first place within their division with 94 points. The Growlers then advanced through the 2019 playoffs to the league finals where they defeated the Toledo Walleye in six games to win the Kelly Cup. The Growlers were the first team since the 1989–90 Greensboro Monarchs to win the ECHL championship in an organization's first season of operations. They are also the first Canadian team to win the Cup.
They did not get to defend their title in 2020 as the playoffs were cancelled due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Growlers then voluntarily suspended operations for the 2020–21 ECHL season as the pandemic still had ongoing travel restrictions. In the 2021 offseason, head coach Snowden was hired by the Growlers' AHL affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, as an assistant coach and the Growlers brought in Eric Wellwood as the next head coach.
Mascot.
Buddy the Puffin is the mascot of the Growlers. Buddy, a longtime sports mascot in St. John's was previously the mascot of the St. John's Maple Leafs and later the St. John's IceCaps. Buddy's number is 92, which represents 1992, the year that he was introduced as the mascot of the St. John's Maple Leafs. Buddy was also the mascot for the St. John's Edge basketball team.

Sabrina Ionescu

Sabrina Elaine Ionescu (born December 6, 1997) is an American professional basketball player for the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). She played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks. She is the NCAA all-time leader in career triple-doubles, the Pac-12 Conference all-time leader in assists, and the only NCAA Division I basketball player to record 2,000 points, 1,000 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in a career.
Early life.
Ionescu was born in Walnut Creek, California to Romanian-American parents. Her father, Dan Ionescu, fled Communist Romania around the time of the 1989 revolution, seeking political asylum in the United States. He hoped that his then-wife, Liliana Blaj, and their son Andrei could join them in a few months, but they were unable to move to the US until 1995. By that time, Dan owned a limousine service in Northern California, where he had chosen to settle because he had several extended family members in that area. Sabrina was around three years old when she first picked up a basketball. She has a twin brother Edward ("Eddy"), who was born 18 minutes after her. Eddy played basketball at the City College of San Francisco before transferring to Oregon; he was solely a student in the 2018–19 school year before walking on to the Ducks men's basketball team in 2019–20.
In a 2019 interview with Ava Wallace of "The Washington Post", Ionescu admitted to being a "natural scorer", but said that most of the rest of her skill set came from playing alongside both boys and older girls in her childhood:
Ionescu attended a middle school that did not have enough players to field a girls' team, and her school refused to allow her to play on the boys' team. She recalled, "My middle school said I should be playing with dolls. Seriously, word-for-word." She responded by recruiting enough girls to enable her school to have a team.
High school career.
Ionescu was four-year varsity basketball letter winner at Miramonte High School in Orinda, California under head coach Kelly Sopak.
As a freshman in 2012–13, she started 14 of 29 games and averaged 13.8 points, 3.9 assists and 3.9 steals per game to help her team to a 27–3 record and a Northern California Section Division II runner-up finish.
As a sophomore in 2013–14, Ionescu helped her team to a 30–2 record.
During her junior year, Ionescu averaged 18.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 4.7 steals per game, and helped Miramonte High School to a 30–2 record with an appearance in the CIF open division semifinals.
In her senior year, she led Miramonte to the CIF open division title game after averaging 25.3 points, 8.8 assists, 7.6 rebounds, 4.5 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. She posted a triple-double in the championship game loss to Chaminade with 24 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds. Ionescu also made a first half buzzer beating shot from half court. She received national honors including the USA Today Girls Basketball Player of the Year, Max Preps Player of the Year, Cal-Hi Sports Ms. Basketball State Player of the Year and Gatorade State Player of the Year. Ionescu was named a McDonald's All-America and Jordan Brand All-American selection. She was named the McDonald's All-America game MVP after scoring a record 25 points, including seven three-pointers, with 10 rebounds.
Ionescu left Miramonte with a career win-loss record of 119–9 and a school-record 2,606 points scored. She is also the all-time leader in assists (769), steals (549) and triple-doubles (21). In addition to the career record, Ionescu also held the Miramonte top three single season scoring records with 598 (2013–14), 760 (2014–15) and 834 (2015–16). Ionescu also held the single-game scoring record of 43 points vs. Pinewood High School while being double- and triple-teamed and the single game record in assists with 19 at Dublin High School.
Ionescu was the No. 1 ranked point guard and No. 4 overall player in the recruiting class of 2016. According to Ava Wallace of "The" "Washington Post", Ionescu chose Oregon "because she wanted to be "the" all-American at Oregon, not just "an" all-American somewhere else." At the time, she was the highest-ranked recruit ever to commit to Oregon basketball. However, she had difficulty making a college choice, not signing a National Letter of Intent with any school during either the early signing period in November 2015 or the late period in April 2016. Ionescu finally committed to Oregon just before the school's 2016 summer term began, driving with her father for 8 hours from their Bay Area home to Eugene, making an unannounced visit to Matthew Knight Arena and telling head coach Kelly Graves that she would join the team.
College career.
Freshman season.
As a freshman, she was named the 2017 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year as voted on by league coaches. Her Freshman of the Year honor was the first Oregon Duck since 1999 and is the second Duck to earn the honor all-time. Ionescu recorded four triple-doubles, one shy of the Pac-12 record and two less than the NCAA record. She averaged 14.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game, ranking second on the team in scoring and rebounding, and first in assists. She also posted seven double-doubles, ranked third in the Pac-12 and 29th in the NCAA with 183 assists on the year. Her 1.93-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio was second-best in the Pac-12. She was named Pac-12 Freshman of Week four times and was named USBWA National Player of the Week. Additionally, she was awarded the USBWA National Freshman of the Year as the top freshman in the nation.
Sophomore season.
On February 26, 2018, Ionescu was named ESPNW's college basketball player of the week. Ionescu led the Ducks to their third regular-season league crown all-time and first-ever No. 1 seed in the Pac-12 Women’s Basketball Tournament. She led the Pac-12 in scoring (19.2) and assists, dishing out 7.8 assists per game which was fifth-most in the country. She had 16 double-doubles this season and 14 20-point games. She has recorded 10-assist games 13 times this season, handing out a league season-high 14 twice. Following her second season, she was named the Pac-12 Conference Women's Basketball Player of the Year, and was also named a first team All-American by ESPN. Ionescu's Oregon Ducks also won the Pac-12 championship for the first time since 2000. She was named the winner of the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top Division I women's point guard after the season, and was also a finalist for the Naismith Award. Ionescu became NCAA women's all-time leader in triple-doubles, trailing only former BYU men's player Kyle Collinsworth (with 12) among all NCAA players.
Junior season.
On November 6, 2018, Ionescu recorded her 11th triple-double in a victory against Alaska-Fairbanks. Twelve days later, she would tie the NCAA triple-double record, with her 12th triple-double in a win against Buffalo. On December 20, 2018, Ionescu recorded her 13th triple-double in a game against Air Force and broke the NCAA triple-double record for both men's and women's basketball. She was later named ESPNW Player of the Week. Since that game on December 20, 2018, Ionescu has added five more triple-doubles for a season total of eight, and has broken the Oregon women's basketball assist record (formerly 608 assists) in a Pac-12 conference game against USC. In the 2019 NCAA Tournament, Ionescu leads the Ducks to their first Final Four appearance after their 88–84 victory over Mississippi State. Ionescu finished the game with 31 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and a steal. In the NCAA Tournament Final Four, the Ducks lost to the eventual national champion Baylor 72–67. After the conclusion of the season, Ionescu was named the 2019 John R. Wooden Award winner along with Duke's Zion Williamson. The award is given annually to the most outstanding male and female collegiate basketball player that year.
Despite having only played for three seasons at this point, Ionescu was eligible for the 2019 WNBA draft by age. Additionally, she would receive her bachelor's degree that June. However, believing that she had "unfinished business" at Oregon, she chose to come back for her senior season. This announcement came shortly after Ionescu accepted a place in a newly launched one-year master's degree program in brand creation in UO's School of Journalism and Communications.
Senior season.
In the second game of her senior season on November 13, 2019, Ionescu surpassed the 2,000 points, 800 assists mark for her college career with a 109–52 win over Utah State. She fell short of another triple-double with 16 points, 12 assists and 9 rebounds in the game but recorded her 2,012 career points and 810 career assists. In a win over then #3 Stanford (87–55), Ionescu scored a career high 37 points along with 11 rebounds and 7 assists, and broke Alison Lang's Oregon all-time career scoring record of 2,252 points in the third quarter. In the rivalry game against Oregon State on January 24, 2020, Ionescu had 24 points, 9 assists and 4 rebounds and broke Oregon State and NBA star Gary Payton's Pac-12 all-time record of 938 assists. Payton personally congratulated Ionescu on the achievement. On February 14, 2020, Ionescu recorded her 1,000th career assist in a game against #7 UCLA and joined Courtney Vandersloot as the only players in NCAA men's and women's basketball history with 2,000 plus points and 1,000 plus assists. Ten days later in the Ducks' 74–66 win at #4 Stanford, she became the first NCAA player ever with 2,000 points, 1,000 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in a career. Ionescu also recorded her eighth triple-double of the season, tying her own NCAA single-season record from last season. Earlier that day, she had been a featured speaker at the memorial service for Kobe Bryant, who had become a close personal friend within the previous two years, flying from Los Angeles to the Bay Area immediately after her speech.
On April 14, 2020, Ionescu was named the winner of the Honda Sports Award as the best collegiate female basketball player in the nation.
Impact at Oregon.
According to Ducks coach Kelly Graves, in 2019 Ionescu had "a chance to be a Marcus Mariota, that level of player and an esteemed Oregon Duck when it’s all said and done." He noted that attendance at Oregon women's games had dramatically increased during Ionescu's career at the school. In the season before she arrived, the average announced home attendance for the Ducks was 1,501. Her sophomore season saw an average attendance of over 4,200; it went up to over 7,100 in her junior season and over 10,000 in her senior season. Ionescu was also a significant draw when Oregon went on the road; for example, when the Ducks visited Washington during her junior season, the crowd for that game was 3,000 more than the Huskies drew two nights earlier against Oregon State.
Graves' remarks about Ionescu's future iconic status at Oregon proved to be prophetic. Shortly after the premature end of her senior season, the university polled fans on social media, asking them to name the four Oregon alumni they would put on a notional Mount Rushmore for the university. According to a 2020 story in the university's web journal "Around the O", more than 70 suggestions were provided, but the four top choices were Mariota, Steve Prefontaine, Phil Knight, and Ionescu. As the story's author Damian Foley put it,
Professional career.
New York Liberty (2020–present).
Because Ionescu turned 22 in December 2019 she was eligible to declare for the 2019 WNBA draft. A January 2019 mock draft by ESPN, incorporating input from WNBA personnel and ESPN women's basketball analysts, concluded that Ionescu was a possible top pick should she declare. However, Ionescu announced in an open letter published in "The Players' Tribune" on April 6, 2019, the day after Oregon's loss to Baylor in the Final Four and four days before the draft, that she would return to Oregon for her senior season.
On April 17, 2020, the New York Liberty selected Ionescu with the first overall pick in the 2020 WNBA Draft. She played her first game with the Liberty on July 25. In her second WNBA game on July 29 against the Dallas Wings, she recorded 33 points, 7 assists, and 7 rebounds in 34 minutes of play.
On August 1, 2020, Ionescu injured her left ankle in the second quarter against the Atlanta Dream. She was diagnosed the next day with a grade 3 sprain, and was expected to miss about one month while recovering. In the end, though, she did not play again for the remainder of her first professional season.
The next season, on May 18, 2021, Ionescu recorded her first professional triple-double. Scoring 26 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds, she became the youngest player in WNBA history to record a triple double. It was also the first Liberty triple-double, as well as the tenth in league history.
National team career.
In late April 2018, Ionescu and Oregon teammates Erin Boley, Otiona Gildon, and Ruthy Hebard entered the USA Basketball women's national 3x3 championship tournament at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ionescu had never before played under FIBA 3x3 rules, admitting after the tournament, "I had to ask the rules before the games started." She adjusted quickly to the unfamiliar format, leading her team to the championship while going unbeaten and also being named tournament MVP. Ionescu and her Oregon teammates would be named as the US team for the 2018 3x3 World Cup to be held in June in the Philippines. At the World Cup, they were the youngest team in the field, but swept their pool, defeating Cup holders Russia along the way.
Personal life.
Ionescu is a Christian. She was close with Kobe Bryant, with whom she had one-on-one training sessions, and spoke at the Kobe &amp; Gianna Bryant Celebration of Life at the Staples Center on Feb. 24, 2020. Sabrina is also very close friends with former teammate, Ruthy Hebard.

Hutton Moor End

Hutton Moor End is a hamlet on the Hutton Moor Road in the north east of the Lake District in Cumbria, England. It lies within the civil parish of Mungrisdale and is known locally as 'Moor End' as it is at the end of the Hutton Moor on an old route-way between Penrith to Keswick.
Hamlet and its listed buildings.
Hutton Moor End is built around two listed buildings just 25 metres apart, (I) Low House and No.1 Low Moorend (1681) and its close neighbour (II) Moor End Farmhouse and Adjoining Barns (1719). Moor End Farmhouse was for many years a busy coaching inn named 'The Sun Inn', used regularly by stage coaches from Lowther Hall to Keswick. The mounting steps for the horses still remain as does a ring for tethering. An inscription high on an outside wall gives the building's age in Roman numerals. Low House's dated lintel is on its side-gabled stone porch cover's entrance.
Placement on the old route-way.
These two listed buildings were built upon an old route-way between Penrith and Keswick on a section known as the Hutton Moor Road. The two listed building's placement on this old-route way can clearly be seen on Thomas Donald's map of Cumberland, 1774 and Clarke's 1787 map as they are the only buildings of Moor End. Apart from a milestone, the Troutbeck Roman sites and a boundary stone they are the only listed buildings on the old road from the east of Threlkeld village to Stainton just outside of Penrith, a distance of 11 miles. The Hutton Moor Road was part of the A594 that was bypassed in the early 1970s by the A66, however the hamlet and a 1.5 mile stretch of the old road remained untouched. The Sea to Sea Cycle Route, which runs from the west coast of Cumbria to the north-east coast, now passes through the hamlet continuing the use of this old route-way.
Hutton Moor End's listed buildings shown on old maps.
Setting.
Hutton Moor End is set in an open area with wide views towards the centre of the north Lakes. Looking north and west from Hutton Moor End are uninterrupted views of Sharp Edge on Blencathra, Souther Fell, the vale of Keswick and Castlerigg Stone Circle. There is a view in-between the Listed Buildings towards the south east of Great Mell Fell showing an ancient tumulus at its summit. Another old route-way, the Old Coach Road can be seen looking south running below Clough Head, Wolf Crags and along the base of Great Dodd. Although Moor End's setting is in a wide open area unusually no towns or villages can be seen from it only small settlements and farms are visible. To the north of the hamlet runs the river Glenderamackin and very near to the east of Hutton Moor End are the Troutbeck Roman temporary or marching camps proving the immediate area's importance as a transport corridor. This group of Roman sites played an important military role in the policing of the Lake District and its indigenous population and controlling access into the northern Lakes. Since the recent discovery of a Roman camp, said to be of national significance close to Castlerigg Stone Circle, historians now believe that it could prove right their previous predictions that the Roman road continued from Troutbeck to Keswick passing straight through the setting of Hutton Moor End.
Present day.
To this day Hutton Moor End's roadside has never expanded and is still just the two listed buildings with their attachments. The hamlet has no public amenities, the nearest church being over 2 miles away at Mungrisdale and the nearest pub being the White Horse Inn at Scales more than a mile away. A caravan site's holiday usage is set off the hamlet's roadside towards the small Troutbeck river running to the east. The attachment to Low House is its old converted barn and attached to the old farmhouse is a cottage once used as a forge.
The Lake District National Park, which Hutton Moor End is a part of, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the Cultural landscape category in 2017.

Philipp Friedrich von Breuner

Philipp Friedrich Graf von Breuner (6 September 1597, Győr – 22 May 1669, Vienna) was an Auxiliary Bishop of Olmütz and Prince-Bishop of Vienna.
Biography.
He was the son of a Feldzeugmeister and Hofkriegsrates from the Austrian noble family Breuner. From 1617 to 1621 he studied in the Collegium Germanicum at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and graduated with a doctorate.
On 8 December 1621, he was ordained a priest in Nikolsburg and was appointed on 9 September 1630 auxiliary bishop in Olmütz and titular bishop of Ioppe. The episcopal ordination was received on 5 September 1635. He was also a canon in Olmütz, Wroclaw and Regensburg, and Provost in Brno. Emperor Ferdinand III appointed him Prince-Bishop of Vienna on 5 May 1639, Pope Urban VIII confirmed it on 5 September 1639. On 26 December 1639, he was installed in St. Stephen's Cathedral.
He is described as a pious bishop, concerned with pastoral care and the preaching activity of priests. For the growing suburbs of Vienna, he redefined the parish boundaries. He was able to complete in 1641 the new building of the Episcopal Palace, begun by Prince-Bishop Anton Wolfradt in 1632 according to the plans of Giovanni Coccapani.
The Prince-Bishop erected the monumental high altar in St. Stephen's Cathedral and concluded a contract with the stonemason and sculptor Johann Jacob Pock from Constance on 1 March 1641. His first master builder was Simon Humpeller, followed by Hans Herstorffer in 1641, followed by Adam Haresleben in 1654. The large altarpiece was painted by Tobias Pock, brother of the sculptor. After some delays, he was able to solemnly dedicate this work on 19 May 1647. His marble coat of arms was attached to the altar, and he also had the new cathedral stalls carved.
On 18 May 1647, he consecrated the column, crowned by the statue of the Immaculate Conception in front of the church on the courtyard (model of the Marian Column of Munich in front of the town hall). Emperor Ferdinand III resolved to celebrate the feast of the Immaculata Conceptio on 8 December in his dominions.
Prince-Bishop Breuner is buried in the women's choir of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.

SMS V187

SMS "V187" was a "S-138"-class large torpedo boat of the Imperial German Navy. She was built by the AG Vulcan shipyard at Stettin between 1910 and 1911 and launched on 11 January 1911.
"V187" was still in service at the start of the First World War, but was sunk by British cruisers and destroyers at the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914.
Construction and design.
The Imperial German Navy ordered 12 large torpedo boats ("Große Torpedoboote") as part of the fiscal year 1910 shipbuilding programme, with one half-flotilla of six ships ("V186"–"V191") ordered from AG Vulcan and the other six ships from Germaniawerft. The two groups of torpedo boats were of basically similar layout but differed slightly in detailed design, with a gradual evolution of design and increase in displacement with each year's orders.
"V187" was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced design and deep load. The "V186" and "G192" groups of torpedo boats had their forecastles cut back to allow their forward pair of torpedo tubes to fire directly ahead, but this made the ships very wet in high seas, and "V187" was modified with the forecastle lengthened and the forward set of torpedo tubes moved aft of the forecastle break and the ship's bridge.
Three coal-fired and one oil-fired water-tube boiler fed steam at a pressure of to two sets of direct-drive steam turbines. The ship's machinery was rated at giving a design speed of , with members of the class reaching a speed of during sea trials. 136 to ns of coal and 67 tons of oil fuel were carried, giving an endurance of at , at or at .
The ship was armed with two 8.8 cm L/45 guns, one on the Forecastle and one aft. Four single 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes were fitted, with two forward, one between the ship's two funnels, and one aft of the funnels. The ship had a crew of 84 officers and men.
"V187" was laid down at AG Vulcan's Stettin shipyard as Yard number 305 and was launched on 11 January 1911 and completed on 4 May 1911.
Service.
On commissioning, "V187" joined I Torpedo Flotilla as leader, and remained the leader of I Flotilla in 1914.
First World War.
On 28 August 1914, the British Harwich Force, supported by light cruisers and battlecruisers of the Grand Fleet, carried out a raid towards Heligoland with the intention of destroying patrolling German torpedo boats. The German defensive patrols around Heligoland consisted of one flotilla (I Torpedo Flotilla) of 12 modern torpedo boats forming an outer patrol line about North and West of Heligoland, with an inner line of older torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division at about . Four German light cruisers and another flotilla of torpedo boats (V Torpedo Boat Flotilla) was in the vicinity of Heligoland. "V187", the leader of I Torpedo Boat Flotilla, formed part of the outer screen of torpedo boats. At about 06:00 on 28 August, , another member of the outer screen reported spotting the periscope of a submarine. As a result, V Flotilla was ordered out to hunt the hostile submarine. At 07:57 "G194" was fired on by British warships, and was soon retreating towards Heligoland, pursued by four British destroyers. V Flotilla and the old torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division also came under British fire, and were only saved by the intervention of the German cruisers and , with the torpedo boats , and "T33" damaged.
"V187" headed eastwards towards Heligoland in poor visibility when she encountered four British destroyers (, , and ) coming from the east at about 09:25 hr, and turned southwards towards the Jade estuary with the four destroyers in pursuit. Two British light cruisers, and , were sighted to the West, on a course to intercept "V187", and the torpedo boat reversed course away from the cruisers back towards the destroyers. "V187" managed to dash past the four British destroyers without damage, but then found a second division of four destroyers (, , and ) ahead. Trapped between two groups of destroyers, "V187" was taken under heavy fire at close range which disabled the ship's machinery, bringing the blazing torpedo boat to a standstill, and causing her to cease fire. The British destroyers lowered boats to rescue "V187"s crew, but "V187"s crew, believing that the British were attempting to board the torpedo boat, fired on "Goshawk". The British destroyers then re-opened fire on "V187" which sank at about 10:10 hr. The boats of the British destroyers started to pick up "V187"s crew, but these rescue operations were interrupted by the arrival of the German cruiser "Stettin". Two of "Defender"s boats had to be left behind, carrying 28 survivors of "V187"s crew and 10 British sailors. Later in the day, the British submarine surfaced by the two boats. She took off the British sailors and three of the Germans, but had no room for the remaining members of "V187"s crew, and so gave them food and water and a course for Heligoland. 24 of "V187"s crew were killed, with 14 wounded and 33 taken prisoner by the British.

Barry Ace

Barry Ace (artist) (born 1958) is an Anishinaabe (Odawa) photographic and multimedia artist and curator from Sudbury, Ontario. Ace's work includes mixed media paintings, and mixed media textile and sculptural work that combines traditional Anishinaabe textiles and beadwork with found electrical components. Ace has a strong interest in combining traditional and contemporary technologies, aesthetics, and techniques in his artwork.
Early life.
Barry Ace was born in 1958 in Sudbury, Ontario. He is a band member of M'Chigeeng First Nation, Manitoulin Island. Ace's surname is pronounced "Es" and translates to the Ojibwe word for "clam," also relating to the word for "small clam" spelled "esiins" or "esens." Ace's heritage links him to Chief Assance (alternatively spelled Aisance, Aissance, and Essens) of the Nigig (Otter) clan, the otter being an important messenger figure in Anishinaabe history. Ace was first introduced to techniques that he would later employ in his artistic practice at the age of seven or eight when he helped his great-aunt Annie Owl-McGregor to make Anishinaabe splint-ash baskets. He also found inspiration from the beadwork, quillwork, and basketry made by his grandmother Mary McGregor-Ace.
Education.
Barry Ace initially studied to be an electrician at Cambrian College but switched to graphic arts. Ace's background knowledge in electricity did however later play a role in his artwork in his mixed media works that include electrical components.
Ace has lectured at the University of Sudbury in the Indigenous Studies Program, and at Laurentian University, and Carleton University in Canadian Studies. In 2015 he taught a workshop at the Ottawa Art Gallery where participants made a collective mixed media map of the city of Ottawa. He also led a workshop for children from an Ojibwe immersion school in the fall of 2016 where the artwork produced by the children was later displayed at the Ojibwe Cultural Foundation. Ace is participating in the Nigig Visiting Artist Residency put on by the Indigenous Visual Culture Program at OCAD University in the winter of 2018.
Themes.
Much of Barry Ace's work uses found materials like capacitors, resistors, and light-emitting diodes, and traditional Great Lakes-style floral beadwork to comment on "cultural endurance undeterred by centuries of colonial oppression and rapid social change." Ace's work explores the relationship between historical techniques and traditions and contemporary materials and subject matter. By referencing the history of Anishinaabe textile art in works that use contemporary mass-produced materials, among other themes Ace investigates the dialogue between Indigenous and European cultures, much like fellow artists Rosalie Favell and Jeff Thomas do. One example of this is the history of the use of glass beads from European traders in Indigenous beadwork that Ace references in his textile pieces. Some of Ace's work explores the particular aesthetic of technology and popular culture in Indigenous art, something that fellow artist Rosalie Favell also incorporates in her work.
In 2010, Ace performed "A Reparative" "Act", a performance of four solo dances in the traditional Woodland style in Paris referencing the nineteenth-century dance performances of Chief Maungwadaus in Britain and Continental Europe. Ace's performance and essay was part of Robert Houle's "Paris/Ojibwa" research project which opened at the Canadian Cultural Centre in Paris.
Exhibitions.
Barry Ace's artwork has been exhibited at galleries such as the National Gallery of Canada, including Abadakone in 2019, the Ottawa Art Gallery, Karsh-Masson Gallery, the Art Gallery of Southwestern Manitoba, Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Canadian Museum of History. Ace's work has been collected by the Canada Council Art Bank, Woodland Cultural Centre, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Ottawa Art Gallery, Indigenous Affairs and Northern Development Canada, the National Gallery of Canada, Nordamerika Native Museum, the City of Ottawa, and Global Affairs Canada.
Some notable exhibitions that Ace has been included in have been the "Canadian Biennial" at the National Gallery of Canada (2017), "Insurgence/Resurgence" at the Winnipeg Art Gallery (2018), "raise a flag: works from the Indigenous Art Collection (2000 - 2015)" at OCAD University (2017), "It's Complicated" with "007" at Central Art Garage (2017), "Always Vessels" at Carleton University Art Gallery (2017), "Every.Now.Then: Reframing Nationhood" at the Art Gallery of Ontario (2017), "Native Fashion Now: North American Indian Style" at the Peabody Essex Museum (2016), "Memory Landscape" at Museu Nogueira da Silva, Universidade do Minho (2016), and "In/Digitized – Indigenous Culture in a Digital World (007 with Special Agent Robert Houle)" at SAW Gallery (2013). An earlier exhibition that Barry Ace was featured in was "Emergence from the Shadows: First Peoples Photographic Perspectives" (1996) held at the Canadian Museum of History and curated by Jeff Thomas. The exhibition involved six contemporary Indigenous photographers addressing representations of Indigenous culture through their engagement with and display of their work alongside historical photographs from the museum, including portraiture. The artists that Ace exhibited with were Mary Anne Barkhouse, Rosalie Favell, Greg Hill, Shelley Niro and Greg Staats.
Ace has curated several shows himself, including "A Celebration: The Art of Canada's First Peoples" (Rideau Hall, Ottawa, 1996-1997), "Perpetual Bundle" (Hull, 1996), and "inter/SECTION" (Hull, 1998). He served as Chief Curator for the Aboriginal Art Centre, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada from 1994 to 2000.
Awards.
In 2015, Barry Ace won the K.M. Hunter Artist Award for visual arts. Ace won the Ontario Association of Art Galleries' Curatorial Writing Award in 2012 for his essay "A Reparative Act," which was written for Robert Houle's "Paris/Ojibwa" exhibition catalogue. He also won the Deputy Minister's Outstanding Achievement Award with his team in 1999 for the artist-in-residence and exhibition program that they launched at Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.
Organizations and groups.
With Ryan Rice, Ron Noganosh, and Ahasiw Maskegon-Iskew in 2006, Barry Ace co-founded the non-profit Aboriginal Curatorial Collective (ACC). Connecting Indigenous curators and cultural producers across Canada, the ACC has played an important role in gathering a strong Indigenous arts community and supporting curatorial and writing projects that share the many voices that make up that community. Barry Ace also co-founded the OO7 (Ottawa Ontario Seven) Collective, a group of Indigenous artists that includes Ariel Smith, Rosalie Favell, Frank Shebageget, Leo Yerxa, Michael Belmore, Ron Noganosh, and invited "special agents." The group provides an alternative and experimental space for Ottawa-based Indigenous artists at different stages in their careers.

In the same year Arkle was the subject of a BBC television documentary in the series "Life Story". His first book "A Geography of Consciousness" (1974) was focused on spiritual and philosophical themes. A second book was published in 1977, "The Great Gift", which concentrated on his paintings and poetry. Arkle composed music which was a precursor of the later ambient style. He collaborated with Robert John Godfrey and The Enid in providing artwork for their 1976 album "In the Region of the Summer Stars". Godfrey later orchestrated three of Arkle's compositions for a 1986 cassette album "The Music of William Arkle". This was re-released on CD in 2017.

SMS V186

SMS "V186" was a "S-138"-class large torpedo boat of the Imperial German Navy. She was built by the AG Vulcan shipyard at Stettin between 1910 and 1911 and launched on 8 February 1911.
"V186" took part the First World War, being renamed "T186" in February 1918. She survived the war and was scrapped in 1922.
Construction and design.
The Imperial German Navy ordered 12 large torpedo boats ("Große Torpedoboote") as part of the fiscal year 1910 shipbuilding programme, with one half-flotilla of six ships ("V186"–"V191") ordered from AG Vulcan and the other six ships from Germaniawerft. The two groups of torpedo boats were of basically similar layout but differed slightly in detailed design, with a gradual evolution of design and increase in displacement with each year's orders. 
"V186" was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced design and deep load. 
Three coal-fired and one oil-fired water-tube boiler fed steam at a pressure of to two sets of direct-drive steam turbines. The ship's machinery was rated at giving a design speed of , with members of the class reaching a speed of during sea trials. 136 tons of coal and 67 tons of oil fuel were carried, giving an endurance of at , at or at . 
The ship was armed with two 8.8 cm L/45 guns, one on the forecastle and one aft. Four single 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes were fitted, with two on the ship's beam in the gap between the forecastle and the ship's bridge which were capable of firing straight ahead, one between the ship's two funnels, and one aft of the funnels. The ship had a crew of 84 officers and men.
"V186" was laid down at AG Vulcan's Stettin shipyard as Yard number 304 and was launched on 28 November 1910 and completed on 20 April 1911, as the first of the 1910 torpedo boats to complete.
Service.
At the outbreak of the First World War, "V186" was based in the Baltic Sea as part of the Baltic Coast Defence Division. In September 1914, "V186" and the torpedo boat were transferred to the High Seas Fleet, being replaced in the Baltic by six torpedo boats ("G132"–"G136"). On 26 July 1915, the 1st Torpedo boat Half-flotilla, including "V186" was escorting minesweepers when the British submarine spotted the torpedo boats and torpedoed "V188", blowing off the torpedo boat's stern and sinking her. A torpedo was also fired at "V186", which took evasive action and retaliated with a torpedo of her own fired at the submarine's wake. "E16" was, however, unharmed. "V186", leader of the 1st half-flotilla of I torpedo Boat Flotilla, was again present in the Baltic in December 1915, and attempted rescue operations when the light cruiser and torpedo boat were sunk in a Russian minefield on 17 December.
"V186", part of VII Flotilla, was part of High Seas Fleet when it sailed to cover the Lowestoft Raid on 24–25 April 1916. On 31 May 1916 "V186" sortied with the High Seas Fleet as part of VII Flotilla, in the operation that would result in the Battle of Jutland. She was suffering from condenser leaks, however, and was sent back to port on the morning of 31 May, well before the battle started.
"V186" served as part of the 16th half-flotilla of VIII Flotilla in the Baltic in 1917, taking part in Operation Albion, the German landings on Ösel in October that year. On 20 October, the British submarine attempted to torpedo the German netlayer "Eskimo", but was depth-charged and badly damaged by "V186" and . The submarine's compass was damaged, and as a result, "C32" ran aground the next day and was scuttled.
"V186" was renamed "T186" on 22 February 1918. She remained part of the 16th half-flotilla of VIII Flotilla at the end of the First World War.
Fate.
After the end of the war, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, "T186" was assigned to Britain as a War Reparation, and was scrapped in Dordrecht in 1922.

1992 UK Athletics Championships

The 1992 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Sheffield Hallam UCA Stadium, Sheffield. It was the only time the city hosted the championships. The men's and women's racewalking events were dropped from the programme for this edition. The women's hammer throw was also not contested after featured for the first time in 1991.
It was the sixteenth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1992 AAA Championships.
Hammer thrower Paul Head and discus thrower Jackie McKernan each won their fourth straight UK title. Linford Christie (100 m) and Paul Edwards (shot put) made it three consecutive wins. Liz McColgan repeated her victory in the 3000 m. Marcus Adam, the 200 m winner, was the only champion to reach the podium in two events, having also finished third in the 100 m.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the Olympic Games. The UK 100 m champion Linford Christie took Olympic gold in that event in Barcelona and the UK men's 400 m hurdles champion Kriss Akabusi took an Olympic bronze. Akabusi and the top three in the UK 400 m (Roger Black, Mark Richardson and David Grindley) all shared in a relay Olympic bronze, as did UK women's champions Phylis Smith and Sandra Douglas.

Aishah Shahidah Simmons is an American documentary filmmaker, author, educator, and activist based in Philadelphia, PA. 
Her 2006 film "NO! The Rape Documentary" addressed sexual assault in the black community, a topic that has, according to Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell "traditionally been so attuned to racism outside that it has largely turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to gender violence within." In a review of "NO!", Andrea Williams described the film as, "notable, not only for its critical exposition, but also for the ways in which it places Black women's voices at the center of its narrative."

Maria Butina

Maria Valeryevna Butina (, sometimes transliterated as Mariya Butina; born November 10, 1988) is a Russian political activist and former entrepreneur who was convicted in 2018 of acting as an unregistered foreign agent of Russia within the United States.
Beginning in 2011, she worked as an assistant for Aleksandr Torshin, a former member of the Federation Council, a member of Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, and a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia. In this role, she worked to infiltrate conservative groups in the US, including the National Rifle Association, as part of an effort to promote Russian interests in the 2016 United States presidential election. The Senate Intelligence Committee later concluded that she attempted to persuade the Trump campaign to establish a secret communications back channel with Russia.
In July 2018, while residing in Washington, D.C., Butina was arrested by the FBI and charged with acting as an agent of the Russian Federation "without prior notification to the Attorney General." In December 2018, she pled guilty to felony charges of conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent of the Russian state under 18 U.S.C. §951. In April 2019, a federal judge sentenced her to 18 months in prison. She served more than 5 months in Tallahassee Federal Correctional Institution, as well as nearly 9 months of her pretrial prison term since arrest, which were counted, and was released in October 2019, and deported back to Russia. She denied accusations that she was a Russian agent.
Early life and education.
Butina was born on November 10, 1988, in the Siberian city of Barnaul, in Altai Krai, about east of the present Kazakhstan–Russia border. Her mother was the chief engineer of an energy enterprise and her father Valery Viktorovich Butin was an entrepreneur who established a furniture manufacturing business in Barnaul. She has one sister and one maternal niece, Kira.
She graduated with honors at the age of 17 from Gymnasium Number 22 with in-depth study of the English language, and from school years she strove for active public activity. She studied political science at Altai State University and also received a teaching degree. At age 19, she was elected to the public council of Altai Krai in the last direct election for the council.
Business and political career.
Butina, at age 21, launched a furniture retail business in Altai Krai. In 2011, she moved to Moscow and sold six of her seven furniture stores to start an advertising agency. That same year, she participated in the Youth Primaries organized by the Young Guard of United Russia, the youth wing of the United Russia party, which she has described as "the current ruling political party in Moscow."
Further in 2011, Butina founded Right to Bear Arms () described as a Russian gun-rights organization. She began traveling back and forth to the US, initially with Aleksandr Torshin, who was then a Senator in the Federation Council of Russia (and a half-month later became Acting Chairman/Speaker of this Senate of Russian Federation) and a leading member of United Russia. He had hired her as his "special assistant" that year. In 2012, they lobbied the council to expand gun rights. Butina resigned from her position as the head of Right to Bear Arms in late 2014.
According to Russians interviewed by RFE/RL, the organization was notable for avoiding opposition to Putin during the 2011–2013 Russian protests, for its "quixotic" support for a cause with little public support and strong government opposition – Putin himself had told Russians "I am deeply convinced that the free flow of firearms will bring a great harm and represents a great danger for us" – for introducing legislation in the Russian parliament that "never went anywhere", and for receding from public view after Butina stepped down as its head. According to US prosecutors who prosecuted Butina on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, her love of guns was a ruse to advance Russia's agenda within the Republican Party. Anders Åslund described Right to Bear Arms as a "front organization with the purpose of infiltrating American groups and forging cooperation with the NRA."
In 2013, she met Republican political operative Paul Erickson in Russia. The two became close, started dating, and eventually moved in together. In 2015, she emailed him a description of a proposed project to influence the Republican Party to be friendlier to Russia, through the NRA. In January 2015, Torshin became deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, and Butina worked as his special assistant until May 2017. In 2017, Butina told "The Washington Post" that she never worked for the Russian government.
In August 2016, she moved to the US on a student visa, and enrolled as a graduate student in International Relations at American University in Washington, D.C. While a student at American University, Butina got drunk on at least two separate occasions and bragged to her fellow students about her contacts in the Russian government; on both occasions, her classmates reported her to law enforcement, sources told CNN.
In February 2016, Butina and Erickson began a South Dakota business, Bridges LLC. Erickson later said the company was established in case Butina needed any monetary assistance for her graduate studies, which Butina commenced in mid-2016 American University in Washington, D.C. In 2018, she completed a master's degree in international relations.
Involvement in U.S. politics.
National Rifle Association.
As part of her work as a foreign agent, Butina worked to infiltrate the National Rifle Association on behalf of Russia.
Torshin and Butina established a cooperative relationship between the NRA and Right to Bear Arms. Torshin has attended NRA annual meetings in the United States since at least 2011. Following the 2011 meeting, then NRA President David Keene expressed his support for Torshin's "endeavors" and extended an invitation to the 2012 meeting. Torshin also attended NRA annual meetings in 2012 and 2013. In November 2013, Keene was a guest at the conference of the Right to Bear Arms in Moscow.
Butina and Torshin attended the 2014 NRA annual meeting as special guests of former NRA president Keene. Butina attended the Women's Leadership Luncheon at the 2014 meeting as a guest of former NRA president Sandy Froman. Butina presented to then NRA president Jim Porter a plaque from Right to Bear Arms. Afterwards, she tweeted "Mission accomplished". As Keene's guest, Butina rang the NRA's Liberty Bell, saying, "To the right to bear arms for citizens of the whole world." Butina and Torshin also attended the 2015 NRA annual convention.
In 2015, a number of NRA officials attended Right to Bear Arms's annual gun conference in Russia. Among them were Keene, gun manufacturer and NRA first vice president Pete Brownell, conservative American political operative Paul Erickson, and Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke. One of their hosts was Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who in 2014 was sanctioned by the White House following Russia's annexation of Crimea. Clarke's trip cost $40,000, with all expenses paid by the NRA, Pete Brownell (an NRA board member and CEO of a gun-parts supply company) and Right to Bear Arms. According to a disclosure Clarke filed, Right to Bear Arms paid $6,000 to cover his meals, lodging, transportation and other expenses. During the meeting, Clarke met the Russian foreign minister and attended a conference at which Torshin spoke. In November 2016, Torshin tweeted that he and Butina were lifetime NRA members.
Republican Party.
Butina has attempted to develop ties to conservative American politics. In a supporting affidavit to the government's support for pre-trial detention following her indictment in "United States of America v. Maria Butina", the FBI stated that she had successfully sought ties to the Republican Party, where it is referred to as "POLITICAL PARTY 1". According to "The Daily Beast", she has presented herself as a "Russian central bank staffer, a leading gun rights advocate, a 'representative of the Russian Federation,' a Washington, D.C. graduate student, a journalist, and a connection between Team Trump and Russia" in order to gain access to "high-level contacts" in Washington. At the 2014 NRA annual meeting, Butina took pictures with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former U.S. Senator and 2016 presidential candidate Rick Santorum. At the 2015 NRA annual meeting, she met Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and in July 2015, she was present at the launch of Walker's 2016 presidential campaign.

In 2015, Torshin, then the Russian Central Bank deputy governor, and Butina met the Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, to discuss U.S.-Russian economic relations. Separately, they also met with a Federal Reserve vice chairman, Stanley Fischer and with a State Department official.
Donald Trump campaign.
In a June 2015 article published in "The National Interest", a conservative American international affairs magazine, just before Trump announced his candidacy for president, she urged better relations between the United States and Russia, saying, "It may take the election of a Republican to the White House in 2016 to improve relations between the Russian Federation and the United States." Her biography on the article did not mention that she worked for the Russian government. The next month, Butina attended FreedomFest, where Trump gave a speech, and asked him from the audience about ending U.S. sanctions against Russia, to which he replied, "I don't think you'd need the sanctions." Butina hosted a birthday party attended by Erickson and Trump campaign aides shortly after the 2016 election.
Relationships with Trump associates.
Butina was in a relationship with Overstock.com CEO and Trump conspiracy theorist Patrick M. Byrne. Byrne claimed the FBI encouraged him to pursue Butina, a claim the FBI denied. In 2019, Byrne divested himself of all shares of Overstock after his relationship with Butina was revealed.
For five years, prosecutors claimed, Butina lived with and maintained an intimate relationship with activist and fraudster Paul Erickson. During Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, Erickson attempted to develop a back-channel between the NRA and the Russian government. Erickson was jailed and convicted of fraud unrelated to his relationship with Butina, then pardoned by Trump in his last week in office.
"United States of America v. Mariia Butina, aka Maria Butina".
Complaint.
On July 15, 2018, Butina was arrested in Washington, and charged with acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government; specifically the Russian Federation, without prior notification to the Attorney General, a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, to wit, 18 U.S.C. §951 (foreign relations, agents of foreign governments), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §371 (conspiracy).
After her arrest, it was mistakenly reported she was charged with a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 U.S.C. §11 foreign agents and propaganda). United States law dictates that all lobbyists representing foreign governments must register as such with the Department of Justice. Her attorney said that "the allegations of the indictment are essentially that her only illegal act was not registering."
On July 18, Butina pleaded not guilty, and a District Court judge ordered her jailed pending trial. She was also said to be cooperating in a federal fraud investigation in South Dakota. Maria Butina was held in solitary confinement in Alexandria Detention Center.
Affidavit.
According to the affidavit in support of the complaint, from as early as 2015 and continuing through at least February 2017, Butina worked at the direction of a high-level official in the Russian government, who, according to "The New York Times", was believed to be Torshin. The court filings detail the Russian official's and Butina's efforts for Butina to act as an agent of Russia inside the United States by developing relationships with U.S. persons and infiltrating organizations having influence in the Republican Party and in conservative politics—such as the National Rifle Association, the National Prayer Breakfast and some religious organizations—for the purpose of advancing the interests of the Russian Federation.
The filings also describe certain actions taken by Butina to further this effort during multiple visits from Russia and, later, when she entered and resided in the United States on a student visa. The filings allege that she undertook her activities "without officially disclosing the fact that she was acting as an agent of Russian government, as required by law."
Butina, Torshin, and Erickson have been subjects of an investigation by the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Erickson is referred to in Butina's indictment as "Person 1." In addition, George D. O'Neill Jr., a conservative writer and Rockefeller heir, is "Person 2." Torshin has also been the subject of a probe by the FBI into whether the Russian government attempted to illegally funnel money to the NRA in order to help Trump win the presidency.
The FBI began to monitor Butina in August 2016, after she had moved to the United States on an F-1 student visa. Rather than confront her immediately, the FBI chose to track her movements and gather information on whom she was meeting, and what her end goals were to be.
Plea deal.
Butina's attorneys and federal prosecutors declared in a November 16, 2018, court filing that they had entered into plea negotiations. On December 13, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an illegal foreign agent, while the original charge of failing to register as a foreign agent was dropped. She faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison and, according to a CNN report, will "likely be deported after serving any time."
On April 26, 2019, Butina was sentenced to 18 months in prison by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, in accordance with the recommendations of prosecutors.
Butina later complained that in the U.S., she was forced to sign a plea-deal. She claimed that she was sentenced for simply being Russian.
Russian reaction.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had no prior knowledge of Butina. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov made a statement saying that Butina's arrest was designed to undermine the "positive results" of the Helsinki summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin. She was arrested a day before Trump met his Russian counterpart. Butina's father has called the accusations against her "a witch-hunt".
Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, called Butina's case a "modern political inquisition." Russia's Foreign Ministry accused the United States of forcing false confession from Butina. According to the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, "having created unbearable conditions for her and threatening her with a long jail sentence, she was literally forced to sign up to absolutely ridiculous charges."
Timeline.
2021.
In 2021, she visited Alexei Navalny, who was on hunger strike, in prison, stating that the conditions in the prison are better than in hotels in the Altai Territory, and Alexei himself is eating candy, not starving.

<doc id="56831523" url="?curid=56831523" title="Anti-Finnish sentiment">
Anti-Finnish sentiment

Anti-Finnish sentiment (sometimes known as Fennophobia) is the hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed against Finns, Finland, or Finnish culture.
Sweden.
During the 1960s and 1970s there was a significant influx of Finnish economic migrants into Sweden. Between 1950 and 1980 the number of Finns in Sweden increased from 45,000 to over 300,000. Attitudes towards Finnish immigrants were quite negative in Sweden. Derogatory expressions "en finne igen" ("yet another Finn") and "finnjävel" (equivalent to "Finnish bastard" or "Finnish devil") were commonly used. An anthology "Finnjävlar" was published, in which 15 Finns in Sweden describe their lives and lives of their parents in Sweden. In Sweden also the Tornedalians were once seen as an inferior race and speaking Finnish was banned in school. However, the Swedish state recently started an investigation about the treatment of Finns and Tornedalians in 2020.
Finnjävel.
Finnjävel (singular) and Finnjävlar (plural) are derogatory terms used in Sweden for Finnish immigrants, mostly during the 1950s and 1960s. In this context, jävel or djävel, literally meaning "devil", is a generic strong insult.
There is a book called "Finnjävlar" that discusses Finnish minority identity in Sweden.
United States.
The prominent role of Finnish immigrants in the 1907 and 1916 Mesabi Range strikes in Minnesota led to blacklisting of Finns. It was the time of anti-Finnish sentiment in the area, and one could see signs "No Indians or Finns allowed." When many Finns came to America they started to set up schools, saunas and political unions, and the involvement in unions caused a bad reputation to Finnish people. Finns also had problems learning English and because they were "new" Finns faced much discrimination. The fact that the Finnish language is a Finno-Ugric language and not related to most other European languages, was used as proof that the Finns were not European and thus a fair subject to discrimination.
China Swede.
China Swede was a derogatory term used for Finnish immigrants in the United States during the early 1900s, particularly in northern Minnesota and Upper Michigan. The expression is a hint to slightly slanted eyes of Finns. Another term was "roundhead"
Norway.
Finns have been emigrating to Norway since at least the year 1000. There exists a Finnish minority in Norway, the Kvens. Speaking a Finnish dialect or a closely related Finnic language (their form of speech is now called Kven) was forbidden in Norway, and they have been discrimnated against. Before WW2, Norway feared mass immigration and invasion from Finland. This was used as an excuse to discriminate Kvens.
Russia.
In Russian, there is a derogatory word for Finnish and Finnic people; "chuckhna". The ministry for foreign affairs of Russia called for Russians to not use the word.
Ingrian Finns were heavily persecuted in Soviet Russia.
Åland islands.
In Åland Finnish people are sometimes discriminated against and insults like Finnjävel ”Finnish devil” are used against Finns.

Emily Muir

Emily Muir (February 10, 1904 – March 19, 2003) was an American painter, architect and philanthropist. After attending Vassar College and the Art Students League of New York, she and her husband moved to Maine in 1939. Mostly known as a portrait painter, Muir painted the official portrait of Senator Margaret Chase Smith for the Maine State House, but early in her career, she and her husband toured throughout Europe and South America painting dioramas for a steamship company. Her watercolor painting, "Orchard Street", is part of the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and she has works in the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum, the Farnsworth Art Museum and the Portland Museum of Art. Self-taught as an architect, Muir designed over 45 homes in or around Crockett Cove near Stonington, Maine. As a philanthropist, she was involved in finding a permanent home for the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle and donated the Crockett Cove Woods Preserve and Wreck Island to The Nature Conservancy.
Early life.
Emily Stewart Lansingh was born on February 10, 1904 in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois to Marian Lore (née Minor) and Van Rensselaer Lansingh. By her first birthday, her family had moved back to New York, where her father originated and where he worked as lighting engineer first in Yonkers and later in Brooklyn. She began studying art in high school and after graduating attended one year at Vassar College, before entering the Art Students League of New York, where she studied with Richard Lahey and Leo Lentelli. During her time at the Art League, she met William H. Muir, who would become a nationally known sculptor and whom she married in 1928.
Career.
Muir began her career as a portraitist and the couple often worked together. Early in their careers, they traveled throughout Europe and Latin America designing dioramas for a cruise line company, the Moore-McCormick steamship line. Her parents bought 85 acres of land at Deer Isle, Maine and asked Muir to design a home for them there. Without any official training in architecture, she designed "Mainstay", which was built by Pop Joyce, a local builder. Liking the area, in 1939, they moved to Stonington, Maine and built a studio and their own home there in the 1940s. Later, they exhibited and toured together giving art classes on the Lyceum Circuit throughout the east coast. Muir primarily worked in oils, but occasionally produced sculpture, and many works in watercolor. In her later career, she produced many landscapes and views of the Maine coastline, reflecting her own interpretation of cubism, using space and light to create the faceting effects. Two of her most known works are a watercolor, "Orchard Street", in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and an official portrait of Senator Margaret Chase Smith which was painted for the Maine State House and is now in the private collection of Senator Smith.
Muir's connection with Senator Smith garnered her an appointment to the United States Commission of Fine Arts in 1955. She served on the board through 1959, simultaneously serving as a trustee at the Portland Museum of Fine Art. That same year, her husband, who was a trustee of the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, which at the time was located in Lincoln, Maine and had no permanent location, suggested the school move to the Stonington area. Muir helped them locate property and reestablish the school in Deer Isle. Searching for the school property, she discovered a lot on Crockett Cove and decided to buy it and build a house on it, starting a second career in architecture. She eventually designed 46 homes in the Stonington/Deer Isle area, focusing on building modern structures which worked as showcases for the landscape, rather than the dwelling. Her sensitivity to environmental concerns were recognized by a Design International award and she was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Maine in 1969.
Care of the environment was a primary concern for Muir, and when a friend asked her what she planned to do with the three islands she owned, Muir decided to donate the properties to The Nature Conservancy as a means of preserving them and preventing overdevelopment. In 1970, she sold Russ Island discounting the price, to the Island Institute. In 1975, she donated nearly 100 acres of woods to the Conservancy, now known as the Crocket Cove Woods Preserve, and donated Wreck Island to the organization, which in turn deeded the property to the Island Heritage Trust. The Island Institute founded the Emily and Willam Muir Fund to develop programs to preserve the area, provide educational opportunities, and spur community growth.
Death and legacy.
Muir died on March 19, 2003 in Stonington, Maine. In addition to the piece at the Smithsonian, Muir has artworks in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, the Farnsworth Art Museum, and the Portland Museum of Art. Muir also published two books, "Small Potatoes" (1940) and "The Time of My Life" (2002), her autobiography. Her papers, as well as those of her husband, form part of the collection of the Archives of American Art and the Smithsonian.

Ammons haunting case

The Ammons haunting case, also known as the 200 Demons House or Demon House, is an alleged haunting and demonic possession which occurred in Gary, Indiana, in the United States in 2011. Latoya Ammons, her mother, Rosa Campbell, and her three children claimed paranormal activity occurred in the residence. The story was publicized in January 2014 and received national attention.
Background.
In November 2011, Latoya Ammons, her mother, Rosa Campbell, and her three children then ages 7, 9 and 12 moved into a house located at 3860 Carolina Street in Gary, Indiana. Days after the family moved in, they claimed black flies swarmed the porch in December and kept returning even after the family believed they were killed.
Campbell initially heard footsteps in the basement and doors creaking. Later, she alleged to have witnessed a "shadowy figure of a man pacing in the living room" and found a "boot print". Campbell claimed she was choked by an unknown force. Ammons' 12-year-old daughter was claimed to have levitated above her bed unconscious during a sleepover with a friend. They were said to have prayed until the girl returned to the bed. The daughter had no memory of the incident. The older son was allegedly thrown across the room by an unknown force. The younger son allegedly had his eyes roll into the back of his head and was growling saying "it's time to die," and "I will kill you".
The family reached out to their physician, Geoffrey Onyeukwu, on April 19, 2012. When he visited the house during the supposed haunting, he noted their behavior was "delusional". Someone from his office contacted police, after the police arrived, the children were taken to the hospital. The older boy was described as acting rationally, while the younger boy "screamed and thrashed".
In 2012, the Department of Child Services (DCS) was alerted to the family. The DCS believed that the children were performing for their mother. Sensational stories published in outlets such as the New York Daily News reported that DCS personnel had allegedly witnessed the youngest boy "walking up the wall backwards". 37 year police captain, Charles Austin, believed paranormal activity occurred in the house. A photo published by the Indianapolis Star claimed to show a "shadowy figure" when no one was home.
The family asked Father Michael Maginot to perform an exorcism. He interviewed the family on April 22, 2012 and concluded they were being "tormented by demons". He eventually performed three exorcisms, two in English and one in Latin. One exorcism was performed on Latoya Ammons.
The Ammons family moved to Indianapolis in 2012 after which the events were said to have stopped.
Skeptical analysis.
Physician Geoffrey Onyeukwu had been skeptical of the entire incident and failed to witness any paranormal incidents. In his medical notes he wrote, "delusions of ghost in home" and "hallucinations". Ammons' children had a history of "irregular school attendance" with a complaint filed against Ammons in 2009. In 2012, she blamed her children's continued irregular attendance on the purported demonic activities.
According to skeptical investigator Joe Nickell, police chief Charles Austin was "an admitted believer in the supernatural, including ghosts". Nickell reported that the photo published by the Indianapolis Star and captioned “Photo by Hammond Police” was, according to the Hammond police chief, not an official photo and was not taken by Hammond police authorities. Nickell also interviewed a number of witnesses and concluded that there were a number of non-supernatural explanations for the claimed supernatural events.
Charles Reed, the landlord, stated he had never experienced any supernatural events at the house. His prior tenants also claimed to never have such experiences. At the time, Ammons was behind on lease and used the claimed paranormal activities to avoid payments. The tenant who moved in after Ammons had not noticed any paranormal events, either. Reed believed the events were a hoax.
The children were interviewed by psychologists, and several professionals concluded "the children were acting deceptively and in accordance with their mother’s beliefs". Tracy Wright, a psychologist, noted that the youngest son "acted possessed" whenever he was challenged or was asked "questions that he did not wish to answer".
Documentary film.
In 2014, Zak Bagans purchased the house for $35,000 and demolished it in January 2016 after filming a documentary in it, titled "Demon House" that was released on March 16, 2018. Dread Central's Steve Barton called it "one of the single most compelling documentaries on the existence of the supernatural that I've ever witnessed." Los Angeles Times reviewer Noel Murray called the film "hooey". According to skeptical investigator Kenny Biddle, the film has been characterized as a pseudo-documentary, "meaning it is filmed in a documentary style but doesn't portray real events".

1993 UK Athletics Championships

The 1993 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Crystal Palace Athletics Stadium, London. It was the second time that the British capital hosted the event, having previously done so in 1980. It would be the last outing of the series in its annual format.
The event programme was expanded to reincorporate men's and women's racewalking events (held separately at Bedford International Stadium), as well as the UK championship debut of both pole vault and hammer throw for women. The women's 3000 m race was dropped, however.
It was the seventeenth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1993 AAA Championships.
Hammer thrower Paul Head and discus thrower Jackie McKernan each won their fifth straight UK title. Linford Christie (100 m) and Paul Edwards (shot put) made it four consecutive wins in their events. Mick Hill repeated as javelin champion to win his fifth UK title overall. Myrtle Augee (shot put), Gowry Retchakan (400 m hurdles) and Debbie Marti (high jump) all defended their women's titles. Runners Curtis Robb and Phylis Smith returned as UK champions, but at longer distances than they won at in 1992.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1993 World Championships in Athletics. Linford Christie added a world title to his UK and Olympic ones, while UK 100 m runner-up took gold in his hurdles speciality in Stuttgart. UK 200 m champion John Regis was runner-up at global level and Jonathan Edwards (triple jump) and Mick Hill (javelin throw) managed World Championships bronze.

The West Coaster (Tasmanian train)

The West Coaster was a passenger train operated by the Emu Bay Railway between Burnie and Rosebery from October 1960 until January 1964.
History.
With the November 1959 introduction of the roll-on/roll-off ship "Princess of Tasmania" on the Bass Strait service from Melbourne to Devonport, Western Tasmania began to experience an increased level of tourism. At that stage there was no road south of Guildford.
Enquiries about transporting road vehicles led to the Emu Bay Railway deciding to replace its railmotor service with a locomotive hauled service with flat wagons to carry road vehicles. The first "West Coaster" ran on 17 October 1960. Pioneer Tours coaches were frequently carried.
The service departed Burnie in the morning, stopping at Guildford to load the road vehicles before continuing to Rosebery returning north in the afternoon. With the opening of the Murchison Highway in December 1963, the "West Coaster" last ran on 2 January 1964. Passengers continued to be carried on mixed trains until 1977.
Rolling stock.
To operate the service, two Dübs and Company-built 4-8-0 steam locomotives were restored to service and named "Murchison" and "Heemskirk" and, along with three former Tasmanian Government Railways carriages, repainted in the company’s two-tone blue livery. To carry road vehicles, flat wagons were attached. On occasions, Australian Standard Garratt and 10 class diesel-hydraulic locomotives were used.

Hippocampus dahli

Hippocampus dahli (lowcrown seahorse) is a fish species of the family Syngnathidae. It is endemic to the Australian northeastern coast, from Darwin to Brisbane, where it inhabits estuarine channels and rubble or soft substrates to depths of . Little is known of its feeding habits, but it is likely to feed on small crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and gammarid, caprellid, and caridean shrimps, similar to other seahorses. This species is ovoviviparous, with males carrying eggs in a brood pouch before giving birth to live young. This species is not listed in FishBase and many authorities treat it as a synonym of "Hippocampus trimaculatus".
Identifying features.
"H. dahli" can grow to lengths of about . Individuals usually have relatively smooth bodies, with low, reduced spines and a low coronet. This species displays sexually dimorphic colour patterns. Females are mostly pale brown to black, often with black scribble marks forming lined, zebra-like patterns. Males are usually dark brown to black with black scribbles.

European flying squid

The European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus) is a species of squid from the continental slope and oceanic waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is the type species of the genus "Todarodes", the type genus of the subfamily Todarodinae of the pelagic squid family Ommastrephidae. It is a species which is targeted by some fisheries, although it is more often a bycatch.
Description.
The European flying squid is a large species squid with a maximum reported size of 750mm measured by mantle length for an unsexed specimen, although this was probably
a female, the largest mantle length known for a male is 640 mm, and these animals commonly have mantle lengths of between 250mm and 350 mm. It has a slender, long and muscular mantle with wide and strong fins, the length of the fins being equivalent to 45% of the mantle length, and is just slightly wider than it is long, tapering to a point posteriorly. The funnel groove has a foveola which does not have side pockets. The tentacular club is very long and extends over three quarters of the length of the contracted tentacle, the club's suckers are held on the elongated carpus in 10 to 12 pairs, the sucker rings of the medial manus suckers have 17 to 20 long pointed teeth; the suckers of the manus are arranged in four series of 14 to 18 rows; the suckers on the dactylus are also arranged in 4 rows. The arm suckers have an enlarged central tooth, 7 to 9 regular teeth and have almost no small alternating teeth. There are no light organs on the viscera. The arms are slender and are more than double the length of the head. The fourth right arm is hectocotylised in males and has the terminal suckers modified into fleshy papillae. The body is dark purplish in colour.
Distribution.
The European flying squid is found in the eastern Atlantic from Greenland and Iceland to the Arctic waters of the Russian Federation, in the lower Barents Sea and Kara Sea, to 13°S to the south of the Gulf of Guinea and to about 40°W; its distribution also includes the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Marmara.
Habitat and biology.
The European flying squid is an oceanic, neritic species of squid that can be found from the surface to depths in excess of 1000 metres and it has been taken in United Kingdom territorial waters at 4,595 m. It is occasionally recorded among the fauna of the seabed on the continental shelf or the upper continental slope, for example off northwest Africa where it is commonly found between 350–700 metres.
This species undertakes migrations for feeding and as it matures in the North Atlantic. Large schools appear offshore near southern Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway and sometimes Scotland in the early summer, and they stay in these areas until the onset of winter. The stranding of large numbers of European flying squid along nearby coastlines is relatively frequent in the summer months in these areas. With the arrival of winter, the squid move to deeper water further offshore where they spend the winter. The populations of the warmer seas off the northwestern African coast and in the western Mediterranean are more sedentary by comparison.
The European flying squid is recorded in large numbers from March to May on the fishing grounds around Madeira, as well as in other areas of the eastern central Atlantic Ocean. Here the squid make ontogenetic movements as well, from the continental shelf to the continental slope and deep waters. This species is also known to undertake daily vertical migrations being found near the sea bed or at depths during the day and moving up to the surface and near-surface waters at night, however they are caught at night in deeper waters indicating that a proportion of the population do not always undertake vertical migrations. Squids of this species may be found solitarily or in small groups but as their trophic migration progresses they form large schools on the continental shelves in the waters of the northern Atlantic and off northwest Africa.
The sex ratio of the European flying squid almost always shows a preponderance of females and there are very few males captured. This appears to be mainly a result of ecological factors as the feeding grounds are sexually segregated and they only meet during spawning. The males may be sedentary, living most of their lives in the breeding areas where they may not participate in the daily vertical feeding movements and remain at depth. The males attain sexual maturity at a smaller size and younger age than the females. In general, the larger animals are found in the cooler areas of its distribution.
In the European flying squid spawning is most likely to be continuous throughout the year on the continental slope, but there are distinct seasonal peaks in late winter or early spring in the northeastern Atlantic. In the Catalan Sea and the Balearic Islands of the western Mediterranean spawning peaks between September and November. The length of the spermatophore depends on the size of the males and on their geographic origin ; being relatively larger (48 to 54 mm) in the Catalan Sea than in the population off North Africa (20 to 29 mm). The female fecundity is high, and each bears up to several hundred thousand eggs, depending on the size of females. The females reduce their feeding activity before spawning, and their spawning is characterized by intermittent egg laying, with the numbers of eggs in each egg mass decreasing. Spawning occurs in depths between 200 m and 800 m) and apparently takes place near the bottom. The early life cycle is not well known but observations on juveniles over the mid-Atlantic Ridge suggests that they are carried by currents and spread in the upper layers of the water column between 50–150 m), although they may go deeper in the daylight hours. Paralarvae observed in coastal waters off North Africa have been observed to rise to the layer just below the surface over the continental slope to feed before migrating as juveniles to the continental shelf. Their growth rate is high, especially in their early life phases but slows as they attain sexual maturity. Their life cycle is thought to take just over a single year to complete, based on statolith analysis but the larger squid of over 500mm mantle length are thought to be 18 months to two years old.
The European flying squid preys on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. In the more northerly part of its range small Atlantic herring ("Clupea harenqus") are the main prey as are Atlantic cod ("Gadus morhua"). Other studies have shown that prey includes pelagic species of fish, for example blue whiting ("Micromesistius poutassou") and herring as well as mesopelagic fish like "Maurolicus muelleri", they also prey on pelagic crustaceans, and cephalopods with cannibalism being quite frequent, with conspecifics being the second most common cephalopod prey. In the Macaronesian Islands lanternfish were the most common and diverse prey, while off northern Norway the most common prey were fish, crustaceans and polychaetes. Its predators include a variety of top Oceanic predators such as tuna, swordfish, sharks, seals and cetaceans. It is an important prey for some species of dolphin and this species along with "Illex coindetii" and "Todaropsis eblanae", are the most important intermediate host for Anisakid nematodes, which are intestinal parasites.
Fisheries.
The European flying squid is predominantly taken as a bycatch of trawl fisheries for other species, but it is also fished by jigging and purse seining. In the summer months it is targeted by commercial and recreational fishermen in southern Italy. The flesh is eaten either fresh or boiled, it preserved by commercial freezing, salting or drying. The species is also utilised as bait in fisheries for cod and halibut. The population is not subject to any specific management measures and the total population consists of several geographically distinct populations. The stocks vary over time as the environment varies. From the late 20th Century to the present the mean catch has been 3,000 tonnes, although this has varied widely, with the largest catches being recorded in 1981-1985. Off Europe the species is taken in association with other members of the family Ommastrephidae and much of the catch is not identified to species. Over the 25 years to 2014 no obvious trend in stocks could be identified and it is therefore assessed as least concern.

Suswa–Isinya–Rabai High Voltage Power Line

Suswa–Isinya–Rabai High Voltage Power Line is an operational high voltage (400 kilo Volts) electricity power line connecting the high voltage substation at Suswa, Kenya to another high voltage substation at Rabai, Kenya.
Location.
The power line starts at Suswa, in Narok County, about , by road, north-west of Nairobi, and runs in a south-easterly direction for approximately to the Ketraco Power Substation at Isinya, in Kajiado County.
From Isinya, the power line follows a south-easterly course to end at Rabai, in Kilifi County, approximately , away, as the crow flies. The power line measures about .
Overview.
The original plan was to build a 220 kilo Volt transmission line. Plans were later revised and the voltage was increased to 400kV. The line serves three main purposes: (a) It transmits power generated from geothermal power stations in the Eastern Rift Valley, to Kenya's coastal region (b) It transmits power from thermal power stations near the coast to the industrial centers in and near Nairobi (c) Through Suswa, the power line connects to Lessos and Tororo, Uganda, allowing the export of electricity to Uganda and Rwanda.
Construction.
Construction started in August 2011, with the Rabai–Isinya section. Construction was budgeted at KSh14 billion (US$140 million), funded with loans from (i) the French Development Agency (ii) the European Investment Bank and (iii) the African Development Bank. The Government of Kenya, invested equity in the project. Kalpataru Power Transmission Limited (KPTL) from India, was the lead contractor on this project. Siemens was the substation contractor. After delays, the power line came on-line in the second half of 2017.

English political intrigue during the Dutch Revolt

English political intrigue, and further involvement in the Dutch Revolt by the Kingdom of England under Queen Elizabeth I, supported the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands in achieving its independence during the Dutch Revolt (1585–1648), in resistance to Habsburg Spain under Philip II. This development led to a more actively interventionist foreign policy for England, going forward in its history.
In addition to concerns about expanded Spanish power in the Netherlands, which was supposed to threaten England itself, French intrigue in the region under the Duke of Anjou also mattered, It became a consideration for Elizabeth's government in addressing its policy towards the Netherlands.
Prominent officials, including Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, and Francis Walsingham, as well as the Queen herself, discussed the situation openly. They took it that the future of the Netherlands was pertinent to English sovereignty. Internal disagreements between the Earl of Leicester and the Queen on the best approach became a controversy on whether direct involvement was necessary, or monetary support and sanctuary to Dutch rebels was better.
English political concerns around the Netherlands.
Concerns with the Spanish and Spanish Allies.
The primary external concern came from worries around the potential actions of Spain. Initial discussion on the necessity of English involvement within the then-ongoing Dutch Revolt was elevated through fear on the part of the Queen's Privy Council to the possibility of the Netherlands to be used by Spain as a staging ground for an invasion into England as a means to depose Elizabeth and reinstate the Catholic Church. Questions were raised among the advisors to the degree of the Spanish King's religious resolve to Catholicism, and as a result, the potential alignment to the wishes of Pope Pius V after Elizabeth's excommunication and the subsequent loss of her legitimacy in the Regnans in Excelsis in 1570. The papal bull, which split Catholics that were within England between devotion to their country and monarch, and to their church within their own community, created uncertainty also to Elizabeth's government in how to predict Phillip's progress. According to historian Wallace T. MacCaffrey:
What frightened and baffled even the most cool-headed English councillors in assessing the probable course of Spanish policy was the unpredictable ideological component in Phillip’s views. Would he be content with the restoration of his power and the re-establishment of his faith in his Burgundian provinces, or would the compulsions of religious ideology drive him beyond these traditional aims to the grander tasks of exterminating heresy in general, and, in particular, in the British Isles? 
Outside of England, and despite a deep common hatred of Spain within England, English Catholic émigrés that fled to the Netherlands as a result of Elizabeth's government, put faith into Phillip to be the catalyst of a return to Catholicism, most strongly so with the de-legitimization of Elizabeth's cousin and next heir at the time, Mary, Queen of Scots.
Governors of the Spanish Netherlands.
Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, the 3rd Duke of Alba, became as governor a symbol for oppression among the Protestant Dutch, having this exemplified in the popular imagination among that population by the executions of Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn.
Don John of Austria, a half-brother of Phillip II, was viewed as having been appointed governor by Phillip in light of his own ambition, having himself “dreamed of a throne of his own.” Don John was also considered by English Catholic émigrés “as early as 1572” to be a good suitor to Mary, Queen of Scots, legitimizing a claim to the English throne. This unofficial candidacy was definitely a cause for concern among the Privy Council under Elizabeth.
House of Croye.
From within the Netherlands, the House of Croye rooted itself as the prominent Catholic family, contrasting to the Protestant House of Orange. Led by the brothers Charles Philippe de Croÿ, Marquis d’Havré and Philippe III de Croÿ, the House supported Spanish intervention within the Low Countries in the interest of working against French influence. In the interests of leadership, they favored a relative of Phillip's, the Archduke Matthias of Austria as the Dutch governor, which he became in January 1578 as Governor-General of Brussels. However, the leader of their rivals in the House of Orange, William the Silent, became the Lieutenant-General underneath Matthias as a result in seeking out a joint Catholic-Protestant solution.
The House also took a particular stance on English assistance, leading other Catholic noble families in accepting English monetary assistance, but not English manpower, especially expeditions led by the Earl of Leicester, who was friendly with the House of Orange. They succeeded to have the Council of State bar the acceptance of English men in late 1577, yet held onto a promise made by Elizabeth of £100,000 to be spent in the conflict. This resolve was later reversed by the States, however, and manned English assistance was allowed on November 19 of that year.
Assassination of William the Silent, the Prince of Orange.
The assassination of William of Orange in 1584 by a Catholic supporter of Philip II acting upon an edict by the latter to have William killed, led to an emboldening of Protestant fervor against the Spanish government despite the action seeming to decapitate the initial resistance movement. Elizabeth responded to the assassination of the Prince of Orange with strengthening her policies assisting in the revolt.
Possibility of French influence.
Even though the Kingdom of France itself was not of an immediate threat or direct concern to the Elizabethan government as Spain was seen to be, its potential ability to utilize the Netherlands against the interests of England caused Elizabeth's government to also consider France in its exterior assessments. France at this time had a similar level of religious conflict in its own borders, between the Catholic establishment of the French Crown and the Protestant Huguenots. Yet despite this, concern existed on the proximity and subsequent power of France:
For Englishmen the specter of French domination of the Low Countries was a frightening one. It would give that kingdom a throttle-hold on England’s main trading partner and secure to her the great financial and industrial resources of these rich provinces. And strategically England would be flanked at every angle from Biscay to the Ems by the single power of France. This last consideration weighed heavily in all English decisions about their neighbors’ affairs. There could be no neutrality towards the troubles of the seventeen provinces nor towards those of France so long as the probability of French intervention in the former remained.
The Duke of Anjou.
Interest in the Duke of Anjou to English interests began at the end of April in 1578, when commissioners representing the States were negotiating with representatives of the Duke, where the States wished for the Duke to be involve himself in the conflict by invading other Habsburg-held territories that were not part of the Revolt, such as Burgundy. Although these discussions yielded no result in practice, it led to reaction by Elizabeth in turn.
When these dealings were brought to the Queen's attentions, William Davison was given orders by Elizabeth to approach the States and amend the terms of the monetary assistance that England would give through Prince Casimir of the Palatinate, who was receiving funding from England in increments of £20,000 for soldiers to help the States, requiring now that it would be on the condition that the States can no longer deal with the Duke if a second £20,000 were to be sent. By late May, the Duke attempts to engage in a treaty with the States to commit “for two months with 10,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 horsemen under his own direct control.” This made Elizabeth furious with the States, ordering Davison to freeze English assets to the States and order Casimir to stay idle until dealings with the Duke are completely ceased and when representatives Walsingham and Cobham will arrive.
At the same time, in the spring of 1578, a series of Protestant insurrections arose in the southern, Spanish-controlled Netherlands, which led to them having “seized churches for their use, expelled the religious orders, smashed altars and images, and demanded the right to public observance and promulgation of their faith.” From these insurrections, the fear of a Spanish advantage from the Dutch disunity as a result of the mass protests caused Elizabeth to promptly reconsider her stance on the Duke, allowing “clandestine agents” to establish a direct line, as well as giving freedom to the States to deal with the Duke.
Sympathies of leaders and other prominent people.
Queen Elizabeth I.
During her reign, the Queen would evolve her strategies surrounding English involvement in the Low Countries at a gradual pace, growing in the amount and type of assistance she was willing to give as time progressed. The concerns levied by her Privy Council about the desire of Phillip II to conduct a Spanish expedition into England were particularly strengthened with the assassination of William, the Prince of Orange, in 1588, where it seemed to be established in the mind of Elizabeth that Phillip was willing to go on an offensive.
In beginning her moves towards intervention, the Queen desired on taking an indirect approach to the situation in the Netherlands, seeking to preemptively establish a formal alliance built among Protestant member princes of the Holy Roman Empire to develop a solidified pan-Protestant solidarity for when it seemed appropriate to act. In this, she approached various German princes to forge the alliance:
Frederick II of Denmark, a German prince of the Empire as Duke of Holstein, was considered by Elizabeth to be a key ally. Initially refusing on September 12, 1577, the direct and formal alliance with England that Elizabeth had anticipated, Frederick began during the rest of the 1570s and into the 1580s to come round to Elizabeth's idea of Protestant cooperation. In a series of exchanges, Frederick resolved to mediate between England and Spain in the Dutch conflict: if Frederick's aid was not accepted by Philip II of Spain, "he would close the Sound to their traffic and (if necessary) offer direct military support to their protestant adversaries, including Elizabeth."
Duke Casimir of the Palatinate was one of Elizabeth's closest allies from her earliest approaches to the conflict. In early 1578, with Elizabeth unwilling use English forces after the defeat of the Protestant Dutch army at the Battle of Gembloux and concerned about such a move provoking the French, she approached the Duke with funds to recruit “6,000 Swiss and 5,000 ‘reiters’ to the provinces” to assist the Dutch. The Duke, who was already aligned to the Protestant cause, took advantage of the opportunity, with payment by Elizabeth being “20,000 pounds immediately and the same sum in addition on days of musters, to be charged against the loan of 100,000 pounds.” This payment would later be halted in response to the States' initial dealings with the Duke of Anjou, and then later returned upon the thaw of Elizabeth's opinion on the Duke of Anjou being involved in the conflict.
The Protestant states of the Netherlands under William also dealt officially in the agreement to solidarity which Elizabeth attempted to foster with the other German states. The Prince of Orange, through Daniel Rogers, suggested a deal with Elizabeth on a direct military alliance against Spain. It anticipated war, and looked to act preemptively against Philip II and his ‘crusade of Catholic re-conquest.’ Elizabeth rejected the offer, and instead made a counter-proposal, as a means to draw the Netherlands into unity with the other Protestant states of continental Europe. Other German states within the Holy Roman Empire that were potential allies in direct alliances included Brunswick, Hesse, Württemberg, and Saxony.
Direct involvement became a change in the policy precedence with Elizabeth with the Leicester Expedition into the Low Countries, allowing for English troops directly under the control of an English leader to be present in the region. Publicly, and to avoid the anxiety around direct involvement in the eyes of the Spanish, Elizabeth had released her intentions with the move on the basis of a cultural defense of the Protestant Dutch:
to give aid to the defence of the people afflicted and oppressed in the Low Countries, were not any desire of aggrandizing either herself or her subjects, but to aid the natural people of those countries to defend their towns from sacking and desolation, and thereby to procure them safety, to the honour of God, whom they desire to serve sincerely as Christian people, according to his word, and to enjoy their ancient liberties; to free herself from invading neighbours; and to ensure a continuance of the old-standing intercourse of friendship and merchandise betwixt her people and the inhabitants of those countries."
In November 1585, she wrote a letter to the States-General within the Netherlands for her declaring her candidacy of Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, to lead the expedition, as well as declaring her favor towards the interest of the Low Countries. Later into the campaign, however, she would take contention with the Earl's approaches in objective to the Expedition, in seeking to establish an entirely new government within the Netherlands independent entirely of the Spanish, an option the Queen did not wish to take.
Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester.
Background with the Low Countries.
Before the Leicester Expedition was to take place, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, already had interactions in the Low Countries, being sympathetic to the Protestant cause led by the House of Orange. This intimacy between the Earl and the House of Orange caused him to be a source of fear among those in contest with Orange, such as the House of Croye. The success of the latter Dutch House in blocking direct English aid in the States-General in late 1577 came as an offence to the Earl, who came to division with William of Orange, viewing it as offensive, until William Davison cooled tensions between the two men. Tension would also arise as well between the Earl and the Queen during the Leicester Expedition over the actions that were taken by the former during the campaign.
The Leicester Expedition.
The impetus behind what would become the Leicester Expedition came about from advice given to her by the Privy Council to operate with a stronger active role within the Low Countries. According to John Bruce of the Camden Society, the advice of the Privy Council was to:
send over a considerable body of auxiliary forces, and to place them under the command of some eminent person, who should not merely direct the military operations, but should also assist the States-General with his counsel, and put them in the way of correcting many errors of government into which they have fallen."
Elizabeth had initially disagreed with this advice, fearing primarily of the precedent that could be set in assisting rebellions against a sovereign ruler, especially against Phillip II in consideration to the danger she was in with the Catholic world. By September 1585, it was guaranteed that the Queen would nominate Robert Dudley to the Privy Council and to the States-General within the Netherlands, due to his perceived intimate knowledge and level of connection to the Queen herself, being a “personal favorite” of hers that also did not have a necessary and irreplaceable role in her Court.
Direct correspondences between Robert Dudley and the Court began on December 1585, in a letter from Francis Walsingham addressed to Dudley, reporting on the Queen's direct instructions for the campaign: stabilize the government, to not engage in battles without “great advantage” assured, to maintain discipline and punishing those who do not honor that call for discipline, to make leaders responsible that forces under their command are at full capacity, to pay soldiers “by the head” with payment disbursed to the captains first, punish leaders who abuse their posts, employ “some well chosen persones” that organize collecting contributions to the war effort, to respect the authority of Dutch nobles as well as especially the children of the late William (of Orange), to clarify that England will not take dominion over the Netherlands at the end of this expedition, and to be available to advise Dutch nobility whenever needed.
The Earl, however, desired to see a return to the Netherlands of the government exercised under the Prince of Orange, who was assassinated the year earlier. This angered the Queen to the Earl's actions, which would become evident when he writes to Walsingham, as well as Elizabeth's Lord Treasurer, Lord Chamberlain, and Vice Chamberlain, acknowledging that the Queen does not appreciate the Earl's own support of this separate Dutch government. Despite understanding this and begging for forgiveness from the Queen, he implores the men he writes to that he is coming solely from a place to benefit the Queen and England as a whole. The height of Elizabeth's discontent with Dudley is explained in letters directly from the Queen to the Earl and delivered by Sir Thomas Heneadge, dated February 10, 1585-6, where she demands him to publicly resign his authority and to inform the States that the actions in accepting the government that Dudley had undertaken did not reflect her wishes as Queen.

Early life.
Boldvai was born on 23 December 1960 as the son of László Boldvai Sr., storekeeper at the Metallurgical Plant of Salgótarján, and Mária Fehér. He has a sister, judge Beáta (b. 1970). He finished his elementary and secondary studies in Salgótarján, graduating from the local Bolyai János Secondary Grammar School in 1979. He spent his compulsory military service in Szeged from 1979 to 1980. Boldai attended the Faculty of Economics of the Humboldt University of Berlin, where he earned a degree of foreign trade economist in 1985. Returning Hungary, he was employed by the Metallurgical Plant of Salgótarján as a foreign trader between 1985 and 1990.
In his young age, he became a member of the Hungarian Young Communist League (KISZ). In 1981, he was elected KISZ leader of the Hungarian students studying in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). He was appointed secretary of the KISZ branch in Salgótarján in 1985. He elevated to the position of first secretary of KISZ in Nógrád County in 1987. He received the merit of Excellent Youth Leader in 1979 and KISZ Merit in 1984. Boldvai also joined the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) in 1979.
Boldvai married to mathematics and physics teacher Csilla Konti in 1985. She taught at the Bolyai János Secondary Grammar School. They have two children Bence (b. 1989) and Kristóf (b. 1993).
Political career.
Boldvai became a founding member of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) in 1989. He served as chairman of its Nógrád County branch between 1989 and 1995. He was on the 61st place in the national list of the Socialist Party in the 1990 parliamentary election, but did not secure a mandate. He was elected to the national board in 1992. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Salgótarján during the 1994 parliamentary election. He was a vice chairman, then a simple member of the Budget and Finance Committee until 2014. He was appointed party treasurer in October 1994, replacing László Máté. He held the position until September 1998, when he was replaced by László Puch. He was re-elected MP for Salgótarján in the 1998 parliamentary election. He secured a parliamentary seat from his party's national list during the 2002 parliamentary election. He was a member of the Economic Committee from 2002 to 2003 and vice-chairman of the Audit Committee from 2003 to 2006. In 2003, he became chairman of the MSZP's Nógrád County branch again.

In November 2007, right-wing daily "Magyar Nemzet" reported, Boldvai began to build a 1050 square meters luxury villa in Salgótarján, which was completed by April 2009. Based on Boldvai's asset declarations over the years, the politician had no income outside his MP salary. "Magyar Hírlap" reported his wife used a BMW jeep and their elder son studied in Switzerland in the same time. Boldvai said before the Immunity Committee, he built the villa through savings, real estate sales and loans.
His wife, Csilla Konti was named in 2016 Panama Papers scandal; accordingly she owned an offshore company incorporated in Samoa with a bank account in Switzerland, which was opened in November 2012, and 80 million HUF was transferred there still that day. Investigative portal Direkt36 asked Boldvai his wife's offshore interests; initially he denied having any knowledge of her dealings. On 5 April 2016, Boldvai admitted to party chairman József Tóbiás, that the information about the offshore company was true and suspended his Socialist Party membership with immediate effect. However, Boldvai renewed his party membership in December 2016, without taking any party posts.

Good Thing (Leon Bridges album)

Good Thing is the second studio album by American singer Leon Bridges. It was released on May 4, 2018, by Columbia Records. The album was supported by three singles: "Bet Ain't Worth the Hand", "Bad Bad News" and "Beyond".
"Good Thing" received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number three on the US "Billboard" 200. The album was nominated for Best R&amp;B Album at the 2019 Grammy Awards. Its single "Bet Ain't Worth the Hand" won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance.
Singles.
The album's dual singles, "Bet Ain't Worth the Hand" and "Bad Bad News", were released for digital download on March 13, 2018, with "Bet Ain't Worth the Hand" later sent to urban contemporary radio on April 10, 2018.
The album's third single, "Beyond", was released on April 20, 2018, it was later sent to urban contemporary radio on April 30, 2018.
Critical reception.
"Good Thing" was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 17 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.9 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.
Chris Willman of "Variety" gave the album a positive review stating, "The new album is not that drastically less of a classicist affair than "Coming Home", when all is said and done, but this time it's a whole variety pack of retro". Luke Fox of "Exclaim!" wrote: "Leon Bridges' sophomore record rings as an endorsement of his range. And that's a great thing for "Good Thing", which tempers its pop-radio ambitions with unique bends on the age-old love song in this super-tight, 35-minute ride." Tara Joshi of "The Guardian" said, "Bridges doesn't entirely leave behind his old-school roots, but, while "Good Thing" is hardly the next "Blonde" or, indeed, "24K Magic", it leaves you with a greater sense of who he is: loved-up, and striving for a level of ambition that feels within reach". Reviewing the album for "Pitchfork", Olivia Horn said that "On "Good Thing", Bridges has kept his heart on his sleeve but updated his parlance to something a little less affected, a little more believable". Joe Levy of "Rolling Stone" said, "Not everything works. "If It Feels Good (Then It Must Be)" and "You Don't Know" feel like fake Pharrell, which is some pretty thin plastic. But the closers—the skin-to-skin makeup sex ballad "Mrs." and the free-ranging autobiographical narrative "Georgia to Texas" (Bridges' second tribute to his mom in as many albums)—show how expansive and individual Bridges can be, even as he guns for the charts".
In more mixed reviews, "Slant Magazine"s Zachary Hoskins stated: "The album falters when Bridges strays from his retro-soul wheelhouse." Kitty Empire of "The Observer" said, "Certain sections of Bridges's audience are likely to define themselves against modern forms, so there is a risk here. But Bridges handles the transition deftly". Kate Lismore of "DIY" commented that, "While he proves in spades that he's not merely a throwback artist who has to rely on nostalgia, the mishmash of sounds coming from the album does feel a little muddled at times".
Commercial performance.
"Good Thing" debuted at number three on the US "Billboard" 200 with 66,000 album-equivalent units, of which 59,000 were pure album sales.

In the 43rd minute, the match was suspended after Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch due to a cardiac arrest. Eriksen was transferred to Rigshospitalet where he was stabilised. UEFA gave the players two options for restarting the match, either to resume later in the evening or the next day at 12:00 CEST. Only after receiving confirmation that Eriksen was awake, the Danish team agreed to continue the match that evening. The match was resumed at 20:30, with the last four minutes of the first half to be completed prior to a five-minute half-time break.

Robin Schofield

Robin Matthew Schofield (6 November 1939 – 6 January 1990) was a New Zealand first-class cricketer who played for Central Districts from 1960 to 1975.
Robin Schofield began his first-class career in 1959-60 as a bowler of left-arm wrist-spin, when he played three matches and took five wickets. He then disappeared from first-class cricket until he re-emerged in 1964-65 as a wicket-keeper. Against Wellington in the first match of the Plunket Shield season he took seven catches in the first innings and nine in the match, setting new records for New Zealand first-class cricket. 
He kept wicket for Central Districts for most of the next ten years, and made useful runs in the lower order. He also played Hawke Cup cricket for Hawke's Bay from 1960 to 1974, scoring a century when they took the title from Marlborough in 1968.
He was a schoolteacher in Taradale, near Napier. He died in an accident while cutting firewood at his home in Puketapu.
The cricketers Sara McGlashan and Peter McGlashan are his grandchildren.

Elections to Erewash District Council were held on 10 May 1973 as part of nationwide local elections. The new district was formed by the merger of the Borough of Ilkeston, the Long Eaton urban district and the parishes of Breadsall, Breaston, Dale Abbey, Draycott and Church Wilne, Hopwell, Little Eaton, Morley, Ockbrook, Risley, Sandiacre, Stanley, Stanton by Dale and West Hallam from the South East Derbyshire Rural District. The new council became a shadow authority before taking over from the existing local authorities on 1 April 1974. The election saw the Labour Party gain control of the Council. Erewash District Council was granted Borough Status in 1975 and from thereon became known as Erewash Borough Council.

After Bach

After Bach is a solo album by pianist Brad Mehldau. It consists of five compositions from Johann Sebastian Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier" interspersed with pieces by Mehldau that were inspired by them. The performances were recorded in 2017 and released by Nonesuch Records the following year.
Background.
Pianist Brad Mehldau is known predominantly as a jazz musician who incorporates numerous influences into his playing. Among these influences is classical music—Mehldau was classically trained—including the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach was an excellent keyboardist, a necessary part of which, during his lifetime, was the ability to improvise. While such improvisation has largely been lost from classical music performance, it is fundamental to jazz musicians.
The origins of "After Bach" were 2015 performances by Mehldau of his compositions that were inspired by Bach and commissioned by Carnegie Hall, The Royal Conservatory of Music, The National Concert Hall, and Wigmore Hall. These were known as "Three Pieces After Bach".
Music and recording.
The album was recorded on April 18–20, 2017, at Mechanics Hall, Worcester, Massachusetts. Mehldau also produced the album.
The first and last pieces on the album are Mehldau compositions. In the first, "a few simple lines are developed in unexpected ways, gather complexity and then resolve with the simplicity of a perfect cadence". For the last, "the bustle of counterpoint is set aside as stark voicings gain warmth, sparse lines hover in space and a wistful melody lingers in the air". Between these two, Mehldau plays four preludes and one fugue from Bach's "The Well-Tempered Clavier"; each is followed by one of his own compositions that is an interpretation of the Bach piece. One is of the Prelude No. 3 in C-sharp major, which features the pianist "resetting Bach's original riff in a jerky 5/4 rhythm and taking it into a harmonically adventurous labyrinth. Similarly, a romantic, rubato-heavy reading of the F minor Prelude and Fugue is followed by a dreamlike meditation on some of the themes hinted at in Bach's original".
Release and reception.
"After Bach" was released by Nonesuch Records on March 9, 2018. The "Financial Times" reviewer described it as a "beautifully formed solo piano album". The reviewer for "The Guardian" commented on the harmonic complexities in the Mehldau pieces, and noted that the last two tracks were more straightforward to engage with emotionally. AllMusic summarized the record as "a warm, endlessly listenable album that still pushes plenty of musical boundaries".

Hanah Margalit

Hanah Margalit is a Professor in the faculty of medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Her research combines bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology, specifically in the fields of gene regulation in bacteria and eukaryotes.
Education.
Margalit earned her B.Sc degree (in Mathematics and Biology, 1974) and MSc degree (in Genetics, with distinction, 1977) from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1985, she completed her PhD in computational molecular biology, under the supervision of Norman Grover, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Career and research.
Margalit completed postdoctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the laboratory of mathematical biology under the supervision of Charles DeLisi, where she developed the first computational algorithm to predict antigenic peptides recognized by immune cells. In 1989, she returned to Israel and established her independent research group at the Faculty of Medicine, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Her early research included development of computational algorithms for predicting binding of antigenic peptides to MHC molecules, computational models of protein-DNA binding preferences, also in collaboration with Nir Friedman, identification of domain pairs as the building blocks of protein-protein interaction networks, analysis of the integrated network of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (in collaboration with Uri Alon), as well as computational models for predicting small regulatory RNA molecules in bacteria, which were verified experimentally in collaboration with Shoshy Altuvia and Gerhart Wagner.
More recently, Margalit's lab studied the dynamics of regulation by small RNAs (in collaboration with Ofer Biham), and computationally predicted that there are viral microRNA molecules that repress the human immune system, a mechanism that was experimentally validated in collaboration with Ofer Mandelboim. Since 2012, Margalit has combined experimental and computational research for studying small RNA-target interactions in bacteria.
Margalit was one of pioneering researchers of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in Israel and worldwide. At the Hebrew University she co-founded the "Computer Science and Life Sciences" program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (in 1999) and the graduate "Genomics and Bioinformatics" program (in 2000). In 2002 she was elected as the first president of the Israeli Society of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (2002-2004). Margalit has mentored over 50 graduate students, many of them holding faculty positions in bioinformatics in Israel and abroad.
Awards and honors.
In 2008 she was awarded the Michael Landau prize in Systems Biology. In 2018, Margalit was elected a fellow of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) for outstanding contributions to the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics.
In 2020, Prof. Margalit was awarded the Rothschild Prize in Computational Biology.
Personal life.
Margalit is married to Avi and a mother of three children.

The Peace

The Peace were a zamrock band, formed in the Chamboli Mine Township of Kitwe, Zambia in the early 1970s.
The members of Peace formerly played in The Boyfriends, which was also the parent group for fellow Zambian band Witch. Founding members of the band included Stuggy Joe Kunda, Gedeon "Giddy Kings" Mwamulenga and John "Music" Muma, whereas the final lineup consisted of Teddy Makombe (lead guitar and vocals), Bruce Kaunda (guitar), Brower Machuta (drums) and Saul Manda (bass).
Though the band came together in the early 70s, their lyrics mostly referenced late-60s themes like love, peace and freedom, and their music refers to pop psychedelics in the likes of Jefferson Airplane, the funk of James Brown and the rock bits of Jimi Hendrix, partly due to their emerging in the early post-independence Zambia. This mixture made their only traceable release, "Black Power", which was recorded ca 1973/1974 and released 1975 on ZMPL, unique within the zamrock scene, a somewhat late echo of the flower power era, fueled by a revolutionary spirit.
In 1976, The Peace went on a three-week tour in Botswana, on which they made more money than on the entire release of their debut album. Later that year, they recorded a second album, called "Black Is Beautiful", but unfortunately it remains lost to this day. Shortly after, the band split up.
Bandleader Teddy Makombe died in 1994, aged 54 after pursuing a career as a sign painter.

Oesman Sapta Odang

Oesman Sapta Odang (born 18 August 1950) is an Indonesian politician of the People's Conscience Party (Hanura), serving as the speaker of the Regional Representative Council and deputy speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly. He had also served in the latter position between 2002 and 2004.
Originating from the town of Sukadana in West Kalimantan, he built a career as a businessman before entering politics, founding the Regional Unity Party and later joining Hanura, where he has served as chairman since December 2016.
Personal life.
Oesman, often nicknamed Oso, was born in the town of Sukadana in West Kalimantan province on 18 August 1950 to parents from other parts of Indonesia. His father Odang originated from Palopo while his mother Asnah Hamid was of Minang descent, originating from Solok. As a child, he worked on rubber plantations and as a cigarette vendor. He did not complete formal education, and only earned his high school degree through a special package ("Paket C") in 2006 at the age of 56.
He obtained an honoris causa degree from the now-defunct Rutherford University in 1999. He competed as a racing car driver in the 1980s, winning national and international level competitions.
Family.
He is married to Serviaty Oesman and the couple has five children. In 2015, his eldest son Raja Septa Sermando died at the age of 41 due to a heart attack.
Career.
He began his business career by trading agricultural commodities such as coconut and ginger between West Kalimantan and Jakarta. At the age of 22, he moved on to the construction industry. As his business grew, he expanded to other sectors, forming the Oso Group. In 2012, he resigned as CEO of the group.
In 2002, he reported his wealth to the Corruption Eradication Commission as Rp 54.6 billion (US$6 million). "GlobeAsia" placed him on its list of 150 richest Indonesians, placing him 103rd with estimated wealth of US$350 million. According to an official report to the Indonesian government, his wealth amounted to Rp 335.6 billion in April 2015.
Politics.
He became a member of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) for the 1999-2004 period, and was appointed deputy speaker of the body on 11 August 2002. He was part of the regional envoys' faction. Following this, he founded the Regional Unity Party on 18 November 2002 and it participated in the 2004 elections, but only gathered 0.58 percent of votes and failed to secure seats in the People's Representative Council (DPR). The party achieved similar results in the 2009 elections, and merged with nine other minor political parties to form the National Unity Party.
Following the 2014 election, he was elected into the Regional Representative Council (DPD) as a senator from West Kalimantan, winning 188,528 votes. He was chosen as a deputy speaker for the MPR on 8 October 2014 for the 2014-2019 period. On 22 December 2016, he was elected chairman of Hanura for 2016-2020, replacing Wiranto.
He was elected DPD speaker in April 2017 following the expiry of Bengkulu senator Mohammad Saleh's appointment. His appointment received criticism, since Oesman then held two major parliamentary positions in addition to being chairman in Hanura. According to speaker Zulkifli Hasan, Oesman would resign from the deputy speaker position. It was not until February 2018 however that he submitted his resignation. His replacement was left for the Regional Representative Council to decide.
In January 2018, Hanura Secretary General Sarifuddin Sudding () gave him a motion of no confidence. Oesman fired him from the party in response. Deputy chairman of Hanura Wishnu Dewanto said Oesman had violated the party's internal procedures and caused Hanura's popularity to decline. Some others accused him of embezzling Rp 200 billion (US$15 million) of party funds. Following the split, multiple members holding positions in the People's Representative Council were replaced with Hanura legislators in Oesman's faction. The other faction moved to support candidates not initially endorsed by the party in the 2018 regional elections, such as in East Java.
Oesman has proposed Wiranto as incumbent President Joko Widodo's running mate in the upcoming 2019 elections. He was set to run for reelection, but the General Elections Commission removed his name from the ballot as he was still affiliated to political parties.

Fall (Better Call Saul)

"Fall" is the ninth and penultimate episode of the third season of the AMC television series "Better Call Saul", the spinoff series of "Breaking Bad". The episode aired on June 12, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.
Plot.
Jimmy discovers from Irene, his former elder law client who represents the class in the Sandpiper Crossing lawsuit, that the company has offered a settlement which if accepted will result in Jimmy’s share being $1.16 million. Irene has refused to accept because the lawyers have advised her they believe they can get Sandpiper to offer more. Jimmy tries to persuade Howard to accept, but he refuses.
Howard and Chuck meet with their malpractice insurance agents. Based on information provided by Jimmy, the agents inform them that because of Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitivity he will need to be supervised by another attorney at all times or HHM will face a substantial premium increase. Chuck wants to fight the insurance company, but Howard disagrees and says he will force Chuck to retire since his judgment can no longer be trusted. Chuck sues HHM for $8 million, the value of his share of the partnership.
Mike becomes a contracted security expert for Madrigal, a paper transaction designed to launder his stolen money by having him give his cash to Lydia and then receive monthly consulting fees. Kim takes on Gatwood Oil as a second client to cover office expenses in case Jimmy is unable to pay his half while his law license is suspended. Nacho admits to his father that he is working for Hector and begs him to follow Hector's orders. Nacho's father refuses and orders Nacho to leave his house.
Jimmy pulls a series of psychological and social manipulation tricks to turn Irene's friends against her, so that she believes refusing the Sandpiper settlement is against the interests of her fellow clients. She decides to accept the settlement, meaning Jimmy will receive his much-needed share. He returns to his office to give Kim the good news, but she is too busy preparing for an important meeting with Gatwood Oil to listen and leaves in a rush. Due to fatigue from overwork, Kim falls asleep at the wheel and crashes into a boulder.

Margaret Sandbach

Margaret Sandbach (28 April 1812 – 23 June 1852) was an English poet and novelist.
Life.
Born Margaret Roscoe in Liverpool on 28 April 1812, her parents were the merchant Edward Roscoe and his wife and second cousin, Margaret Lace, who was a botanical illustrator and author. She had two brothers, one of whom died in infancy, and the other of whom was Edward Henry Roscoe, with whom she was very close. Their paternal grandfather was the historian William Roscoe and her family were prominent members of Unitarian society in Liverpool.
Margaret married Henry Robertson Sandbach on 4 May 1832. He was then living at Hafodunos, an estate in Denbighshire, North Wales, that had been bought two years previously by his father, the slave-owner, merchant and Mayor of Liverpool, Samuel Sandbach. In time, her husband became a Justice of the Peace for Caernarvonshire and, in 1855, like his father, High Sheriff of Denbighshire.
Margaret's mother's book "Floral Illustrations of the Seasons" had been published in 1829. Her own first book was "Poems", written in 1840 and dedicated to her brother Edward. Her primary literary theme throughout her career was that of the brother-sister relationship, although one of her best efforts - "The Appeal of the Wounded Amazon", contained in "Poems" - was inspired by the Welsh sculptor John Gibson, who had been assisted in his early career by William Roscoe and whom she and Henry had befriended in Rome in the 1830s. Gibson was the dedicatee of a later collection, "Aurora and Other Poems", that was published in 1850, and in 1851 she commenced writing his autobiography, based on his dictation, while he was staying as a guest at Hafodunos. This last project came to nothing because Gibson had to return to Rome upon the death of his brother and Margaret was increasingly unwell with breast cancer.
Although she did write some fiction, notably "Hearts in Mortmain" (1850), it was in poetry that Sandbach excelled. Her novel "Spiritual Alchemy", published in 1851, caused Elizabeth Gaskell to comment in a review on "the folly exhibited by many an author of a moderately successful novel who hurries forward the second on the reputation of the first".
Sandbach died at home on 23 June 1852 and was buried at nearby Llangernyw.
Recognition.
Sandbach's initial documentation of Gibson's life, together with letters between them as friends, formed a significant part of Elizabeth Eastlake's "Life of John Gibson, R. A., Sculptor", published in 1870.
The historian Mark Baker and the singer Linda Lamb collaborated on a collection of songs based on the poems of Sandbach, and Lamb released an album title "The Daughter of Fire and Water". Baker and Dewi Gregory also co-authored a book based on her life, published in 2013 as "Margaret Sandbach: A Tragedy in Marble and Ink".

Campeones Cup

The Campeones Cup is an annual North American association football match contested between the winners of the previous MLS Cup from Major League Soccer and the winners of the Campeón de Campeones from Liga MX. The competition was established by the two leagues in 2018.
Format.
The Campeones Cup is contested by the winner of the MLS Cup, held annually in November, previously in December, to decide the winner of the Major League Soccer season, and the Campeón de Campeones, held annually in July between the winners of the Apertura and Clausura tournaments in Liga MX. The competition is hosted by the Major League Soccer team, based in either Canada or the United States, at the end of the summer. Its format is similar to that of the J.League Cup / Copa Sudamericana Championship, which is always hosted by the Japanese team.
History.
The competition was announced on 13 March 2018, as part of an inter-league partnership that would also organize youth competitions and a future MLS All-Star Game featuring an all-star team from Liga MX. The two leagues had previously fielded teams in the SuperLiga, which ran from 2007 to 2010, and currently compete in the CONCACAF Champions League. The inter-league partnership was spurred in part by the joint North American bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and a desire to improve the level of play in CONCACAF. The inaugural edition was hosted by Toronto FC at BMO Field in Toronto on 19 September 2018 and won by Tigres UANL. Atlanta United FC became the first MLS team to win, after defeating Club América 3–2 in 2019.
The 2020 edition, which would have been hosted by Seattle Sounders FC, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. MLS and Liga MX announced that the game would return in 2021. The return of Campeones Cup ended in a 2-0 Columbus Crew win over Cruz Azul at Lower.com Field in Columbus on 29 September 2021.
Performances.

As of the 2021 season, a total of six teams have qualified for the cup. In the table below, teams are ordered first by the number of appearances, then by the number of wins, and finally by alphabetical order.

Charles McHugh (bishop)

Charles McHugh (1856 − 12 February 1926) was an Irish Roman Catholic prelate and was Bishop of Derry for nineteen years from 1907 - 1926.
Early life and education.
He was born in the parish of Aghyaran in West Tyrone in 1856, son of Francis and Catherine McHugh. He was educated locally before proceeding to St Patrick's College, Maynooth and was ordained to the priesthood in St Eugene's Cathedral in June 1881.
His first pastoral appointment was to the staff of St Columb's College Derry and after some years with failing health he asked for a curacy. After recuperation he was appointed President of the College in 1890 and spent 15 years in that role until he was made Parish Priest of Strabane in 1905.
Bishop of Derry.
At the time of his appointment as bishop the Irish Times reported him to be "a prelate of thought, ripe scholarship and invariable courtesy."
He received episcopal consecration on 29 September 1907 and for much of his episcopal ministry the social and political backdrop was the rising Home Rule crisis and then more latterly, the Partition of Ireland which divided his diocese into two separate states. McHugh was an active supporter of John Redmond up to the start of the First World War.
In July 1916 Bishop McHugh established the Anti-Partition League to campaign against the threat of the Partition of Ireland.
McHugh died in office on 12 Feb 1926.

Visconti Castle (Abbiategrasso)

The Visconti Castle of Abbiategrasso is a mediaeval castle located in Abbiategrasso, Lombardy, northern Italy. It lies on the Naviglio Grande axis toward Milan. From its towers the navigation along the canal could be controlled. In the 15th century it was one of the preferred residences of the dukes and duchesses of Milan.
History.
The Visconti Castle of Abbiategrasso was probably built at the end of the 13th century on the site of a previous fortification ("Castro Margazario") near a Benedictine monastery. First Azzone Visconti (1329–1339), lord of Milan, and then Gian Galeazzo Visconti (1378–1402), the first duke of Milan, enlarged the castle. In 1438 it was restored and embellished by Duke Filippo Maria Visconti, son of Gian Galeazzo. Having lost any defensive function, and being easily reachable from Milan by water along the Naviglio Grande, it became his favorite country mansion.
The castle had the typical Visconti castle's structure: a quadrangular layout, with an internal courtyard and portico, and four towers, one on each corner. Bricks were the primary construction material, while the stone was limited to structural or decorative elements, as the slender columns of the mullioned windows, the brackets (beccatelli), or the Biscione on the facade over the old entrance.
To the castle had some inclination the duchesses of Milan. Here (as an alternative to Cusago) had a stable residence Agnese del Maino, mistress of Duke Filippo Maria and mother of Bianca Maria Visconti. The Sforza, dukes of Milan and descendants of Bianca Maria, favored the castle of Abbiategrasso to enhance their Visconti origins.
After the Visconti-Sforza period, the castle progressively assumed the role of a stronghold again, especially during the years of the Italian Wars (1494–1559). In 1658 three towers were demolished, while the fourth was cut off. In 1862 it was sold to the Abbiategrasso municipality, which in the following years obliterated the ramparts to make space to the new train station while also taking care of some restorations.
Today.
Although deprived of the south wing and three towers, the castle is today in good condition and open to the public. It houses the offices and the City Council of the Abbiategrasso municipality.

Sfendali railway station

Sfendali railway station () is a station on the Piraeus–Platy railway line in Malakasa, in the northern part of the Athens urban area, in the municipality of Oropos, Greece. It was inaugurated on 8 March 1904. It is owned by OSE, but service are provided by TrainOSE, through Proastiakos from Athens to Chalcis. According to the album "From the crowds in the metro", in the late 1960s, the former SEKs have been studying the connection of the Sfendalis station with Oropos.
History.
The Station opened on 8 March 1904, as Malakasa railway station (), in what was then the Central Greece on what was a branch line of the Piraeus, Demerli &amp; Frontiers Railway. The name reflected the older name for the area, the station's name was renamed to its current name on an unknown date. In 1920 the station and most of the standard gauge railways in Greece came under the control of the Hellenic State Railways (SEK). During the Axis occupation of Greece (1941-44), Athens was controlled by German military fourses, and the line used for the transport of troops and weapons. During the occupation (and especially during German withdrawal in 1944), the network was severely damaged by both the German army and Greek resistance groups. The track and rolling stock replacement took time following the civil war, with normal service levels resumed around 1948. In 1970 OSE became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971 the station, and most of the Greek rail infrastructure was transferred to the "Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A.", a state-owned corporation. In 1983 the station was rebuilt, reaping on 27 October of that year. The line was converted to diesel sometime before 1990. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. The station was reopened on 6 May 2005. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. That same year on 30 July Line 3 of Athens suburban railway began serving the station.
Facilities.
The ground-level station is assessed via stairs or a ramp. It has 2 side platforms, with the main station buildings located on the eastbound platform, these are however now inaccessible and partially rundown, with access to the platforms via stairs or lifts. The Station is housed in the original stone-built station (Now closed) There is no cafe on-site. At platform level, there are sheltered seating and Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens and timetable poster boards on both platforms. There is no car park or bus connections at the station.
Services.
The station is served the following lines of the Athens Proastiakos or suburban railway:
Line 3 Athens - Chalcis with 1 tph. (transfer to Airport and Regional, Express &amp; InterCity services at SKA)
Migration Criss.
On 31st August 2019, the 09:10 train to Athens was delayed for more than an hour at Sfendali station, with officials removing refugees who moved daily from the reception center in Athens.

Diuris bracteata

Diuris bracteata is a species of orchid which is endemic to New South Wales. It has two folded leaves and up to eight yellow flowers with blackish marks. After its collection in a Sydney suburb in 1888, no further collections were made and the species was presumed extinct until 2004 when it was rediscovered near Gosford.
Description.
"Diuris bracteata" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between two and eight, usually three yellow flowers with blackish markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. There are about five curved, linear bracts along the flowering stem. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, egg-shaped, long and wide with two brown blotches near the base. The lateral sepals are linear, long, wide, turned downwards and are parallel to or cross over each other. The petals are ear-like with an elliptic to egg-shaped blade long and about wide on a blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped to diamond-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are linear to oblong, long and about wide. There are two ridge-like calli about in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in August and September.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris bracteata" was first formally described in 1888 by Robert D. FitzGerald from a specimen collected near Gladesville by Henry Deane. The description was published in Fitzgerald's book, "Australian Orchids". The specific epithet ("bracteata") is a Latin word meaning "small leaf".
Distribution and habitat.
This orchid occurs in grassy woodland and forest near Gosford.
Conservation.
No specimens of this species were collected in the twentieth century and in the year 2000 it was listed as "extinct" under the Australian Government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999" (EPBC Act). Some specimens collected in the Sydney region in 1998 and subsequently, have been re-examined and found to be "Diuris platichila". The species is listed as "endangered" under the New South Wales "Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016". The threats to its survival include its small population size and limited distribution, and disturbance associated with roadworks since some populations occur on roadsides.

1997 British Athletics Championships

The 1997 BAF British Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Alexander Stadium, Birmingham. The 10,000 metres event was hosted separately at the Sheffield Hallam UCA Stadium.
Organised by the British Athletics Federation (BAF), the competition was limited to British athletes only and marked a replacement to the UK Athletics Championships, which had last been held in 1993. The BAF British Championships overshadowed that year's AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors and typically the most prominent meet on the domestic calendar. This has led some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS), to judge the British Championships event as the main national championships for the country for 1997. Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1997 AAA Championships.
The bankruptcy of the British Athletics Federation that same year effectively rendered the competition defunct. The British Athletics Championships returned ten years later in 2007, organised by UK Athletics – the government-led successor organisation to the British Athletics Federation.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1997 World Championships in Athletics. British javelin champion Steve Backley claimed world silver in Athens. UK runners-up Colin Jackson and Denise Lewis were also both runners-up at the global level.

Jesus and the Disinherited

Jesus and the Disinherited is a 1949 book by African-American minister, theologian, and civil rights leader Howard Thurman.
In the book, Thurman interprets the teachings of Jesus through the experience of the oppressed and discusses nonviolent responses to oppression. The book developed out of a series of lectures that Thurman presented at Samuel Huston College in Austin, Texas, during April 1948."
The ideas encapsulated in the book had been developing for a number of years. In February 1932, Thurman gave an address in Atlanta on “The Kind of Religion the Negro Needs in Times Like These,” which was an early version of what would become “Good News for the Underprivileged.” In the summer of 1935, he delivered “Good News for the Underprivileged” at the Annual Convocation Lecture on Preaching at Boston University. The address was printed in the summer 1935 issue of "Religion and Life", and forms the basis of "Jesus and the Disinherited". He would deliver “Christianity and the Underprivileged” again in February 1937 at Union Church in Berea, Kentucky, and at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. On December 10, 1937, Thurman delivered the address “The Significance of Jesus to the Disinherited” as the leader of Religious Emphasis Week at A&amp;T College of North Carolina in Greensboro. A number of other addresses on the theme would take place in 1938, 1939, 1942, and 1947, with the lectures that became the book occurring April 11–16, 1948 as the Mary L. Smith Memorial Lectures at Samuel Huston College in Austin, Texas.
Thurman continued to speak on the theme, delivering addresses in 1949, 1951, 1952, 1957, and in 1959 delivered a 12-part sermon series in the Boston University's Marsh Chapel on "Jesus and the Disinherited."
In his biography of Martin Luther King Jr., Lerone Bennett Jr. notes that King studied Thurman's "Jesus and the Disinherited" during the Montgomery bus boycott.

1979 Italian Senate election in Lombardy

Lombardy elected its eighth delegation to the Italian Senate on June 3, 1979. This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1979 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race.
The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua preferred the Italian Communist Party.
Background.
For the first time the Italian Communist Party lost votes, after a period of terroristic attacks by the Red Brigades. Even the far-right Italian Social Movement was weakened. Between other minor parties, the Radical Party obtained its first seat.
Electoral system.
The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected.

Raid on Annapolis Royal (1781)

The Raid on Annapolis Royal took place on 29 August 1781 during the American Revolutionary War. The raid involved two American privateers - the Resolution (commanded by William Morgan) and the Reprisal (commanded by John Curtis) - attacking and pillaging Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia in revenge of the defeat of the Penobscot Expedition. The privateers took captive the commander of the militia John Ritchie, described as the "Governor of Annapolis." One historian described it as "one of the most daring and dramatic raids upon Nova Scotia."
Background.
During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, The raids intensified after the British victory over the Penobscot Expedition, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and Lunenburg.
On 31 March 1781, a British ship off Halifax, Nova Scotia captured Captain Amos Potter of the American privateer "Resolution" (6 guns, 25 men), while his crew escaped. Captain William Morgan took command of the Resolution. Five months later, Potter's crew sought revenge on the British by sacking Annapolis Royal.
Battle.
Captain William Morgan on "Resolution" was joined by another American privateer "Reprisal" (8 guns, 10 swivels, 60 men) under the command of Captain John Curtis, totalling 80 men. They secured the blockhouse from the three soldiers in the town. Over the next hours, the privateers rounded up the militia, under the command of John Ritchie and lieutenant-colonel Phineas Lovett, and disarmed and imprisoned them. They spiked the town cannon. The privateers then pillaged the valuables from the whole town, taking silverware, provisions, furniture, bedding, clothing and so forth. Ritchie's black servant (whether she was a free black or a black slave is unknown) pleaded on behalf of Ritchie's sick wife to leave some provisions and the privateers gave her tea and sugar.
They retreated to Goat Island and took prisoner both Thomas Williams, the senior ordinance storekeeper and commissary of provisions to the garrison at Fort Anne (and grandfather of Sir Fenwick Williams), and John Ritchie who the Boston Gazette referred to as the "Governor of Annapolis." They also took captive a Sergeant and 5-6 others. They later exchanged "the Governor" for their former commander Captain Potter and returned to Boston the following month.
Aftermath.
American privateers remained a threat to Nova Scotian ports for the rest of the war. Captain William Chair Burnaby was in command of the sloop "Merlin" at Annapolis Royal.
On 1 January 1782, British Captain John Curtis captured an armed schooner in the Bay of Fundy commanded by Captain Hodgkins. The privateer "Lively" under the command of John Augusta Dunn fell in with armed schooner.
On 8 May 1782, "Buckram" (8 guns, 40 men) captured the privateer sloop "Lively" under the command of John Augustus Dunn (8 guns) and the crew escaped. The Buckram rescued Captain Mowatt who was being chased by the American privateer close to Goat Island. Mowat and his crew escaped in the woods.
On March 15, 1782, Potter returned from Boston in "Resolution" and captured the schooner "Two Sisters" off Pearl Island, Mahone Bay (formerly Green Island), stole all the provisions on board and released it.

Isaac Aisemberg

Isaac Aisemberg(22 January 1918 – 26 December 1997) was a writer, screenwriter and Argentine dramatist. Among his most outstanding contributions is his collaboration in the adaptation for the film Hombre de la esquina rosada of Jorge Luis Borges and his novel Cuestion de dados.
Biography.
Aisemberg was born in General Pico (province of La Pampa), made his primary and secondary studies between Córdoba and Buenos Aires and went through the universities of Buenos Aires and La Plata. He was an advisor to the Ministry of Culture of the Nation, a jury in film festivals, a contributor to the International Film Festival of Mar del Plata, a member of the screenwriting tribunal at the Cinematography Institute, a professor in journalism schools, and was in charge of the Circle of the Press and was president of Argentores (General Society of Authors of Argentina).
He wrote numerous stories, novels and plays, among them Es más tarde de lo que crees, No hay rosas en la tumba del marino, No hay ojos aquí and La guerra del cuarto mundo. Some of his works were translated for North American editions and his novel Cuestion de dados, as well as his volume of stories Jaque mate in two plays, appear in important international anthologies. He was awarded as the Prize of Honor of Argentores.
Among other scripts he wrote the films El bote, el río y la gente, La Rabona and Bajo el signo de la patria. When he was writing this last script – in 1971, during the dictatorship of Lanusse -, a general named González Filgueira – president of the Belgraniano Institute – told him that from the SIDE (State Intelligence Service) he had objected to a Jew writing on the motherland and the flag, for which Aisemberg chose to sign it under the name of Ismael Montaña. The critic Fernando Peña has said about that film that "it can humiliate almost all the examples that the genre produced at that time." Rhetoric is avoided with laconic texts that manage to gambol on marble, while the image maintains a clear and dusty tone. 
Among the unspecified projects is a version of Una excursión a los indios ranqueles (who worked with Mario Soffici) and an adaptation of the story La intrusa by Jorge Luis Borges (performed with René Mugica). His collaboration with René Mugica (which Aisemberg considered very pleasant) were also two libretti presented in the contest of the Institute of Cinematography in 1979, El señor Brown y El despoblado, one won first prize and the other a mention.
He was a great speaker, memorable and captivating to those who listened to him.
Between 1995 and 1996, he was the president of Argentores, an Argentine entity that brings together the authors, to which Aisemberg belonged for many years.
He died on 26 December 1997 while he was acting as director of the Center for Experimentation and Cinematographic Production (CERC), the film school of the National Institute of Cinematography.
Conversion to Roman Catholicism.
Twenty years after the premiere of Bajo el signo de la patria, Aisemberg converted to Catholicism. He was converted by his friend, priest Leonardo Castellani, an author of detective fiction and his conversion had Gilbert K. Chesterton's and Graham Greene's books influence.

Larry Taylor (geochemist)

Lawrence August Taylor (September 14, 1938 – September 18, 2017) was an American geochemist and petrologist working at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences in the University of Tennessee. He is the founder of the UT Planetary Geosciences Institute and was also its director until late 2017.
Taylor was a graduate of the Indiana University at Bloomington, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a master's degree in geology. He would move on to receive a PhD from Lehigh University, perform pre-doctoral experimental petrology research at the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and finally a Fulbright Fellowship at the Max-Planck-Institüt für Kernphysik in Heidelberg, Germany.
In December 1972, Taylor was offered to be in the “back room” of Johnson Space Center during the Apollo 17 mission where he had the opportunity to directly advise astronauts on their extravehicular activities on the Moon. Subsequently, Taylor became very close friends with Harrison Schmitt, the last man to step on the lunar surface and the sole geologist to ever reach the Moon. The two would collaborate throughout their careers with Schmitt playing an influential role in helping Taylor develop the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UT.
In 1973, after 2 years of being an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, Taylor would arrive at the University of Tennessee, near the very beginning of the institution's dive into research. Taylor would remain at the University of Tennessee for the latter half of his life and become “one of the true giants in the field” of lunar science and the Director of the University of Tennessee Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences until his retirement in 2017.
Early life (1938–1958).
Taylor was born September 14, 1938, in Paterson, New Jersey and was raised in Port Jervis, New York, over a bar owned by his father. At the beginning of his senior year in high school, Taylor was involved in an automobile accident that forced him to get a hip replacement and left him hospitalized for around 10 months. However, after returning to school, Taylor was still able to pass his final exams and graduate. After high school, Taylor began his higher education with night school at Orange County Community College in Middletown, New York.
Education and early academic career (1958–1973).
In 1958, Taylor left New York City "one step ahead of the law" and started additional education at the Indiana University in Bloomington. In 1961, Taylor graduated but decided to stay and achieve a master's degree in geology due to a friend's persuasion. During this period, Taylor took on many miscellaneous occupations that included: driller, rocker shovel loader, powder-monkey, and geologist in mines in Ontario, Canada. In 1965, Taylor's two children, Kelly and Jeff, were born, and he was introduced to planetary geology at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Taylor would continue his studies at various universities and institutes until 1971, when he was hired as an assistant professor at Purdue University. Just two years later (1973), Taylor would move to the University of Tennessee.
Later career and death (1973–2017).
At the University of Tennessee, Taylor would achieve tenure after only two years and then become a full professor after another two years (1977). In 1993, Taylor married Dong-Hwa (Dawn) Shin. Throughout the rest of his career, Taylor would produce 542 peer-reviewed research papers, and would eventually partially retire in 2017 after 46 years of work. Taylor died on September 18, 2017, four days after his 79th birthday. Taylor's longtime colleague, Hap McSween, remembers him as a "diamond in the rough" and states that his "constant presence in the department will be missed."
Works.
Taylor led a prolific 46-year career with more than 100 articles published in science journals including:
In 2005, Taylor met with S. Ross Taylor and G. Jeffrey Taylor in the Gatlinburg, Tennessee Meteorological Society meeting to write "The Moon—A Taylor Perspective," also known as the "Taylor-cubed paper." This article was featured in a special 2006 issue of Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta dedicated to Larry Haskin.

Fall in Line

"Fall in Line" is a song by American singer Christina Aguilera for her eighth studio album "Liberation" (2018), featuring guest vocals from American singer Demi Lovato. It was released as the album's second single on May 16, 2018 by RCA Records, impacting hot adult contemporary radio and contemporary hit radio on June 19 and May 28, respectively. Aguilera co-wrote the song with Johnny Simpson, Mark Williams, Audra Mae, Raul Cubina and Jon Bellion, while the production was handled by the latter.
"Fall in Line" is centered around lyrical themes of female empowerment, being recognized as a feminist anthem. The song received positive reviews from music critics, who commended Aguilera's and Lovato's vocals, as well as the lyrics and inspiring theme. Commercially, "Fall in Line" made minor impact on charts, but reached top-forty positions in Hungary and Guatemala, as well as the digital charts of Greece, Spain and the United States. For promotion, an accompanying lyric video was uploaded onto Aguilera's official YouTube channel simultaneously with the song's release, followed by a music video directed by Luke Gilford. The singer also performed it on several occasions, including the Carpool Karaoke segment of "The Late Late Show with James Corden", 2018 "Billboard" Music Awards, "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", and "Today Show". The song was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. This marked Aguilera's twentieth Grammy nomination and Lovato's second Grammy nomination.
Background.
Aguilera described the song: "I wrote 'Fall in Line' a few years ago before all this news came out [Time's Up and Me Too movement]. It was the song that needed to be heard. Because of what I witnessed when I was growing up I always felt really driven to have a voice that my mom kind of never had in my childhood. So I've always wanted to be that advocate for women and anybody that was struggling to have their own voice. I watched my mom have to be submissive, watch her Ps and Qs or she's gonna get beat up. You can either be, unfortunately, so damaged by it that you take a turn for the worse, or you can feel empowered by it and make choices to never go down that route." In November 2018, the track's songwriter and producer Jon Bellion revealed that at one point, Beyoncé had tried to secure the song for the R&amp;B duo Chloe x Halle.
In June 2018, Aguilera appeared on DJ Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show, giving an interview about "Liberation". The singer explained that the track was committed to everyone that felt disempowered, adding: "It's a message that I've preached [...] I think the chorus can fit anybody's feeling if they feel repressed, or oppressed, or whatever's going on in their lives that they feel they need to come to their own realization". Aguilera also revealed that she decided to work with Lovato because it was important to choose someone that is vocal about their own struggles and past, stating: "I wanted somebody that could 'come to play'", adding that they "put so much heart and passion into it" and teared up when first hearing their vocals on it. Aguilera also sent them flowers and mentioned "I was just like, 'Oh my God, you took it to the next level'".
Release and promotion.
"Fall in Line" premiered on May 16, 2018, at 8 a.m. EST, and was released commercially for digital download worldwide at the same time. Aguilera stated in a tweet: "To anyone who's ever felt silenced and repressed, the truth seekers and bold thinkers...may you liberate your voice and break the mold, never back down, and never fall in line."
Recording and composition.
Aguilera co-wrote "Fall in Line" alongside Johnny Simpson, Mark Williams, Audra Mae, Jon Bellion, and Raul Cubina, while the production was handled by Jon Bellion. The track was recorded at The Guest House in Hollywood Hills, California, while the mixing was handled by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios. The mastering was performed by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace, New York City. Instrumentation for the song included trumpet and flugelhorn by Ryan Svendsen. The song is performed in the key of C major with a slow tempo of 40 beats per minute, and the vocals span from the low note of B2 to the high note of C6, with Lovato's belting range reaching up to B5.
"Fall in Line" has been described as a "feminist anthem" and a sequel to Aguilera's 2003 song, "Can't Hold Us Down" with a lyrical content of women's rights. The introduction to the song is the track "Dreamers", which "features a group of young girls declaring goals like 'I want to be a journalist,' 'I want to be heard,' 'I want to be president.'" Aguilera stated that the track was recorded a few years ago and before movements such as Time's Up and Me Too came out. She added: "It was the song that needed to be heard. Because of what I witnessed when I was growing up I always felt really driven to have a voice that my mom kind of never had in my childhood. So I've always wanted to be that advocate for women and anybody that was struggling to have their own voice."
Critical reception.
Jon Pareles from "The New York Times" felt that "Fall in Line" is "addressed directly to 'little girls'", pointing out the lyric "You do not owe them your body and your soul", while Brittany Spanos from "Rolling Stone" described the track as an "empowering duet". During a review for "Liberation" for "USA Today", Patrick Ryan said that the song is a "soulful riff-off", and Aguilera and Lovato are "belting to the rafters as they preach to young girls the importance of speaking their minds and being themselves". Chuck Arnold from "New York Post" described the song as "torchy" and "fiery", also stating that "Fall in Line" is "defiant duo". Ilana Kaplan and Joe Goggins from "The Independent" felt that "Fall in Line" is a standout on Liberation, describing it as a "impassioned feminist anthem", and also stating that Aguilera and Lovato are "two of the best vocal powerhouses in the game".
Daniel Kreps of "Rolling Stone" called Aguilera and Lovato's singing abilities "remarkable" and deemed the final chorus a "skyscraping duet". Gil Kaufman of "Billboard" described the track as "a towering empowerment anthem". Rebecca Farley of Refinery29 described the track as Aguilera's 2002 song "Beautiful"-meets-Lovato's 2017 song "Sorry Not Sorry", calling both singers as "obstreperous pop performers who are done being sorry". The "BuzzFeed" editor provided a supporting commentary, calling the song "a power anthem". In July 2018, "Cosmopolitan"'s Eliza Thompson listed "Fall in Line" as one of the "best songs of the year so far".

In the United States, the song entered at number 39 on the "Billboard" Digital Songs chart with only two days of sales, since the song was released towards the end of the tracking week. The next week, the single ascended to its peak of number 17, becoming her highest-charting song since "Say Something". Thereby, it debuted at number-one on the Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart, which serves as an extension to the "Billboard" Hot 100. In Canada, "Fall in Line" reached number 97 on Canadian Hot 100, becoming Aguilera's second lowest charting song. Elsewhere, the track achieved its strongest positions in Hungary, debuting and peaking at number 17 on the Single Top 40 chart, and Guatemala, peaking at the same spot on the Guatemalan Monitor Latino airplay chart. It also achieved top-forty positions on the digital charts of Greece and Spain, reaching number 21 and 37, respectively.
Music video.
The accompanying music video was directed by Luke Gilford and premiered May 23, 2018. It depicts Aguilera and Lovato being kidnapped and forced to sing in a futuristic prison filled with surveillance cameras; the two eventually fight their way to freedom. Aguilera stated on Twitter, "Fall In Line is as much about supporting each other as it is about self-empowerment. I wanted to convey that in this video by visually representing the imprisonment that so many of us have felt, and the freedom we can achieve together." According to "Billboard" and "Rolling Stone", "The oppressive, male-dominated prison facility is a clear critique on society's oppression of women."
Live performances.
Aguilera made the live performance debut of "Fall in Line" on Carpool Karaoke episode 471, which was first broadcast on May 16. She performed the song with Lovato at the 2018 "Billboard" Music Awards four days later. The song was also added to the set list of the European leg of Lovato's Tell Me You Love Me World Tour. On 14 June, Aguilera performed "Think", "Fighter" and "Fall in Line" on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon". The next day, she performed "Can't Hold Us Down", "Fall in Line" and "Fighter" on "Today Show". Aguilera also performed the song on her ongoing residency and tour, The Xperience and The X Tour respectively.

Kikendatch Bay

The Kikendatch Bay is a freshwater body that leads to the Gouin Reservoir, in the territory of La Tuque, in
Haute-Mauricie, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This bay is mainly located in the township of Levasseur, except the entrance (west side) of the bay located in the canton of Aubin. Following the erection completed in 1948 of the Gouin Dam, the "Kikendatch Bay" became an extension of Brochu Lake located further north-west, i.e. at the extreme east of Gouin Reservoir.
Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second. A civilian seaplane base is located at the top of the Gouin Dam.
The route 400, connecting the Gouin Dam to the village of Parent, Quebec, serves the southern part of Kikendatch Bay, as well as the valleys of Jean-Pierre River and Leblanc River; this road also serves the peninsula which stretches north in the Gouin Reservoir on . Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
The surface of Kikendatch Bay is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to late March.
Toponymy.
This hydronym identifying this bay under the specific "Kikendatch" (graph "Kirkendatch" used in the introduction of Description of surveyed townships ... (1889)) originated the transfer of the name of the trading post that had been established 20 km northwest of the Gouin Dam.
In 1832, the map of Arrowsmith (entitled British North America) identifies this post, as "mission center of Haut-Saint-Maurice" by the priest of Yamachiche, Quebec, Severin-Nicolas Dumoulin (1793-1853), first missionary, in 1837, to visit the population of Atikamekw since the voyage of the father Jacques Buteux in 1651.
In his 1806 diary, Jean-Baptiste Perrault speaks of Kikèndâche. One of his sketches indicates a lake Kikèndàtche. According to Father Georges Lemoine, this name is of Algonquin origin and means where the boiler is and designates a place on the shore where the rock is dug in the form of a boiler. Variant: Baie Martel.
The toponym "Kikendatch Bay" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Shoppers Fair

Shoppers Fair was an American discount department store chain. It was founded in 1956 in Bridgeport, Connecticut and owned by New York City-based Mangel, but primarily operated in the state of Michigan. The chain closed the last of its stores in 1975.
History.
Shoppers Fair was founded in 1956 with a store in Bridgeport, Connecticut. By 1962, the chain was a subsidiary of New York-based Mangel and operated thirty-five stores in twelve states, with nine of those thirty-five being located in Michigan. In 1971, Shoppers Fair reached an agreement with Borman's Inc., owner of the Yankee Stores chain, to acquire eight stores closed by Yankee in the metro Detroit area due to unprofitability. One of the eight, in Roseville, had never opened for business as Yankee.
The Shoppers Fair chain was part of two lawsuits: one in 1960 against a department store in Flint, Michigan called The Fair, and another four years later against an owner of an IGA store in Fort Smith, Arkansas also called Shoppers Fair. Both cases ruled in the other stores' favors.
Mangel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 1974. At the time, the company had 46 Shoppers Fair stores and 94 Mangels clothing stores.
By December 1974, all of the Detroit stores were closed, and by 1975, the ten remaining stores in the chain had gone out of business as well.

Ulla Nenonen

Ulla Pirkko Nenonen (31 October 1933, Loviisa, Finland – 9 March 2018, Tampere, Finland)
was a Finnish theologian, missionary with the Finnish Missionary Society and Bible translator, who served in missionary work in Namibia during a 54-year span. Of Finnish missionaries, only Martti Rautanen and his wife Frieda and daughter Johanna have served longer in the mission field.
Nenonen spent most of her childhood in Kuusankoski, but she graduated from high school in Imatra in 1954. She obtained a degree in theology from the University of Helsinki in 1960. Soon after this she departed for Ovamboland.
Career as a teacher in Ovamboland.
Ulla Nenonen arrived to Ovamboland, one of the mission fields of the Finnish Missionary Society, in 1961, and began by studying Afrikaans and Oshindonga. At first she worked at the Oniipa Printing Press, but soon she was transferred to Okahao, to work the local women’s teacher training seminary, and she soon became the principal of the seminary. She later also taught as a teacher in the local secondary school. At that time, the government had no schools in the north of Namibia, so the mission schools were the only possibility for the locals to get education. Life in Ovamboland was peaceful, until the aspirations of the SWAPO to achieve independence for the country turned into guerrilla warfare. “I had to make the decision of whether my life was more valuable that the life of someone else. I came to the conclusion that it certainly wasn’t,” she said the Finnish Broadcasting corporation Yle in an interview in 2011. Once she defied the night time curfew established by South Africa and drove a patient to a government hospital, since she could not expect that a local driver could be assumed to undertake such a task. She was stopped by the authorities and was given a strenuous interrogation, but in the end she was allowed to proceed.
During 1980–83 Nenonen worked as the vice-rector of the Oshigambo High School. During 1983–93 she acted as the head of the mission in Oniipa. She was there in one of the most important places with regard to the independence process of Namibia. She hosted the General Secretary of the United Nations, various emissaries, ministers and presidents from different countries, among them Martti Ahtisaari, who was overseeing the transfer from South African to Namibian rule. Nenonen was able to provide these people with accurate information on what was going on in the country.
Work as a Bible translator during retirement.
After retiring from the FMS, Nenonen did not return to Finland, as other missionaries had done, as she was invited by Bishop Kleopas Dumeni of the Ovambo-Kavango Church to assist in Bible translation to the Dhimba language in Opuwo, Kunene Province, where she worked until 2015. Dhimba is closely related to the Herero language and somewhat more distantly related to the Ovambo language. Her collaborator in this work was the Dhimba pastor Johannes Tolu, the only Dhimba to have studied to become a pastor. At the time, the Dhimba language did not have a writing system, so their first task was to devise one. The work was supported by the Lutheran Bible Translators from the United States, the United Bible Societies and a Finnish association called Support for the Namibian Church. The work of Pastor Tolu was supported by the Tampere Cathedral Congregation. The New Testament was completed in 2011, but due to difficulties in its printing, it appeared only in January 2014. After that the team began to translate the Old Testament. Study of the Dhimba language has also been a part of the project, as well as collecting of stories and songs, and the team has also produces primers, reading books, songbooks, and put out Compact Cassettes, which contain texts from both the Old and the New Testament read aloud in Dhimba. One aspect of the work has been the development of the Dhimba language with a view toward its preservation and a literacy programme.
Even after her return to Finland in 2015, Nenonen assisted the Dhimba translation team via e-mail, and proof read translations and helped in compiling a dictionary of the language.
Yle has made a television documentary of the Dhimba Bible translation programme with the title “Dhimba translators”. It was broadcast on YLE 1 in 2003.
The work of Ulla Nenonen has received attention from e.g. President Martti Ahtisaari, when he spoke in the 140th anniversary festivities of the Finnish Missionary Society in 1999.

She was also a writer of magazine articles. She served as president of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, vice president New York Water Color Club, and was a member of the Pen and Brush Club, the American Water Color Society, the New York Women's Art Club, and the National Arts Club."
Early years and education.
Emily Maria Spafard was born in Springwater, New York, August 27, 1832. She was the daughter of Thomas Lawrence (1797–1888), and Almira (Baldwin) Spafard. Her father, a veteran of the Mexican war, was a lumber merchant.Her ancestry on both her father's and mother's side was English. Her father's family came from Yorkshire, England, in the early Colonial days, with Rev. Ezekiel Rogers, and their history is connected with the struggles and privations of those early settlers. At an early age, her father left New England for western New York, where he built a home and reared a large family. From him, she has derived the qualities which enabled her to overcome serious obstacles.
She was educated in the public schools of Springwater, and at Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she studied for two years.
Career.
In Manchester, Michigan, on March 1, 1853, she married lawyer, Charles Scott, of Lyons, Iowa, after which, they removed to Iowa. After his death May 2, 1865, she removed to New York City with the purpose of making a place for herself among the thousand other struggling women. In 1871, she studied at the National Academy of Design, followed by the Art Students' League, in New York. In 1872, she left for Europe and studied in Paris under Raphael Collin. During her two years abroad, she copied in the galleries and continuing her studies in Rome, Florence, and Paris. From 1876, she made her home in New York City, although she has made a number of trips to Europe after her first visit. These included Holland, France, and England, where she lingered for months to obtain all the help possible from those sources.
She entered with enthusiasm into all the avenues for the advancement of art. Scott was one of the organizers of the New York Watercolor Club, and was its recording secretary after its incorporation. During her teaching career, she helped many young women until they were self supporting.
Her opinions on art and on topics other than those connected with her profession were original and stimulating, and for this reason, she was often called upon to read papers before women's clubs throughout the country. Her studio in New York, filled with trophies from many countries, became the rendezvous of literary men and women as well as artists.
Exhibits and collections.
Some of her most important works are: A large still life picture, exhibited in the Paris salon (1889); “Yellow Roses,” which won a medal at the Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia, 1895, and “Pink Roses,” with which she won a medal at the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893.

Scott also exhibited at the Paris Exposition in 1911. She received the watercolor prize at the Exhibition of Woman's Art Club, 1902; and her work was represented in the Erie Public Library.
Scott's watercolor painting, "Yellow Roses" is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Her paintings are also included in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, and Cleveland Public Library.
Roses were Scott's favorite study, and she painted them with a tenderness and sentiment rarely seen in flower pictures, throwing on the canvas a lifelike reproduction that is difficult of description.

Ayaz-Kala

Ayaz-Kala is an archaeological site in Northern Uzbekistan, built between the 4th century BCE and the 7th century CE. Situated on a hilltop overlooking the Kyzylkum Desert, the site encompasses the ruins of an ancient Khorezm fortress. 
History.
The site consists of three fortresses which were built from the 4th century BCE to the 7th century CE. The fortresses were part of a series of forts at the edge of the Kyzylkum Desert, which provided defence against raids by nomads and the Saka of the Syr Darya delta. Part of Ayaz Kala was built in the second century by the Kushan Empire. The now-ruined fortress is speculated to have been built as part of a chain of border fortresses guarding the borders of the Kyzylkum Desert. In addition to the eroded remains of defensive works, the remnants of several residential structures have been uncovered at site.
Ayaz Kala 1.
Ayaz Kala 1 is a fortress dating back to end of the 4th or beginning of the 3rd century BCE. In this time Khorezm had become independent from Persia. Ayaz Kala 1 was part of a chain of fortresses protecting the agricultural settlements from attacks by nomads. The fortress is situated on the top of a hill, approximately high, providing wide views over the surrounding plains. The fortress is rectangular in plan with sides long. The main axis is oriented from south to north.
At the southern end of the axis is a square "gateway", which is a typical element of frontier fortresses of Khorezm. The enemies' approach lies parallel to the south east walls and invaders were vulnerable to attack from above. A massive gateway defended by two rectangular towers leads into a small rectangular chamber. This chamber was overlooked on all sides by high walls from which bowmen could shoot at the enemy in case the first gate was breached.
The "enclosure" of the fortress consists of an inner and outer wall with a vaulted corridor between them, about 2 m wide. The walls continue above the vaults, forming a protected rampart walk. The walls are up to high and at their base 2.2 to 2.4 m thick. The walls are reinforced in the 3rd century BCE by 45 watchtowers in half elliptical form, at a distance from each other of 11.5 m at the northern and of 14 m at the eastern and western sides.
The fortress seems to have been in use until the 1st century CE and might have served as a refuge for the locals up to the early medieval period.
Ayaz Kala 2.
Ayaz Kala 2 is a feudal fortress dating from the 6th to 8th century CE, in the Afrighid period. It was built on the top of a conical hill, about 40 m high, situated south west of Ayaz Kala 1. The fortress consists of the "entry" on the south western side and the "main building" which is oval in shape.
In the 6th to 8th century CE Khorezm was ruled by the Afrighid dynasty of Khorezmshahs. At this time the "dihqans", a new class of feudal landowners came into existence. They were descendants of the ancient nobility, courtiers or soldiers who had been rewarded for military services. Their agricultural estates were called "rustaq". They lived in "donjons", small square forts surrounded by a defensive wall. An important example called "Yakke Parsan" is situated 10 km south of Ayaz Kala.
Ayaz Kala 2 was built of rectangular mud bricks on a foundation of "paksha" (cob). The upper parts of the outer walls were crenulated. The building was fortified with low battlements and a row of arrow slits. Ayaz Kala 2 had a 50 m long sloping man-made staircase on the southern side of the fort.
The "main building" is considered as a palace with residential quarters, ceremonial halls with ceilings supported by multiple columns and a fire temple, luxuriously decorated with wall paintings. This building seems to have been the residence of a feudal lord loyal to the Khorezmshah. The building was built in the 4th century CE and destroyed by two separate fires. The palace was in use during the 6th and 7th cent CE as a domestic dwelling. A vast urban complex of buildings was located at the feet of the fortress.
Ayaz Kala 3.
Ayaz Kala 3 is a fortified garrison dating from the 1st to 2nd century CE. The monumental building in the north east corner may have been founded in the 5th or 4th century BCE. The site covers an area of about 5 hectares.
The enclosure wall is one of the largest fortresses in Karalpakstan. Ayaz Kala 3 is 66 percent larger than Ayaz Kala 1. It has the shape of a parallelogram with sides 260 m and 180 m long. The structure of the external wall is similar to Ayaz Kala 1. The external walls are 7.5 m wide. The circular watchtowers have a size of 8 m. The fortress was built with "paksha" in the lower parts and masonry in the upper parts. made of adobe blocks. The entrance to the fortress on the western side consists of an S-Shaped extension of the external wall. The interior of the fortress is empty.
The monumental buildings in the north east corner cover an area of 2,400 m². The building has 40 rooms divided into 4 groups by 2 central corridors. There are remains of a narrow corridor on three sides of the buildings. The southern and eastern walls have square watchtowers, about 2×2 metres.
It is supposed that Ayaz Kala 3 was used in Kushan times as a garrison or as a ruler's residence and refuge for the local farming population and that a small force used Ayaz Kala 1 as a lookout post.

No Sleepin'

"No Sleepin" is a song recorded by Romanian singer Corina and Romanian rapper JJ, released on 25 October 2010. It was written by Andrei Maria, Corina and JJ, and produced by Maria, Bogdan Albulescu, Corina and Șerban Cazan. "No Sleepin'" marked the singer's return to the music industry after a hiatus. Musically, it is a synthpop-influenced uptempo dance song featuring a piano and a clink sound in its instrumentation; its lyrics revolve around partying at night and not sleeping.
A music critic from Romanian website Divercity Cafe was positive towards the track, predicting its commercial success, while another compared it to the works of DJ BoBo. To accompany "No Sleepin'", a music video was premiered on 13 January 2011. Filmed by Marian Dinescu at the Casa Scriitorilor in Bucharest, Romania, it portrays Corina impersonating a female punk burlesque character. The visual received a nomination in the Best Video category at the 2011 Romanian Music Awards. Further promoted by a live performance at the aforementioned event, the track peaked within the top ten in Romania and on the Polish television airplay chart, as well as within the top 60 in Russia.
After being sent a demo version of "No Sleepin'", German girl group LaViVe recorded a cover version of the song for their debut studio album "No Sleep" (2010). Retitled into "No Time for Sleeping", it was released as a CD single in Germany on 10 December 2010 by Starwatch Music. While music critics gave mixed reviews of their rendition, it peaked within the 20 in Germany and Austria, and within the top 30 in Switzerland. "No Time for Sleeping" was aided by the release of a music video in early December 2010, as well as by a supporting tour in the aforementioned countries.
Background and composition.
"No Sleepin'" features collaborative rap vocals from Romanian rapper JJ. It was written by Andrei Maria, Corina and JJ, and produced by Maria, Bogdan Albulescu, Corina and Șerban Cazan. The song was produced at the in Bucharest. Regarding the sessions, the singer stated: "'No Sleepin' is my re-invented music after sleepless nights spent in the studio, where I mocked the mad enthusiasm of the people at HaHaHa Production." Released on 25 October 2010, the track marked Corina's return to the music industry after taking a nearly two-year hiatus to raise her child.
Musically, "No Sleepin'" is a synthpop-influenced uptempo dance song featuring a "discreet" piano and a "clink" sound in its instrumentation. The track's lyrics revolve around partying at night and undersleeping; lines include: "I'm feeling naughty, I'm feeling good, I'm feeling pretty/Ain't got no plans, Ain't got no job, Ain't got no meanin'". A writer of Romanian website Divercity Cafe noted the playful vibe of the song, while "B.Z." compared it to the work of DJ BoBo.
Music video and promotion.
An accompanying music video for "No Sleepin'" premiered exclusively on "Libertatea" and Romanian website Monden.info on 13 January 2011. It was subsequently uploaded onto Roton's official YouTube channel one day later, preceded by the release of a teaser on 20 December 2010. The high-budget clip was filmed on 29 November 2010 by Marian Dinescu at the Casa Scriitorilor in Bucharest, Romania, with Dana Budeanu hired as a stylist.
According to Corina, she portrays a "fresh, rebellious, slightly eccentric, sexy and delicate-incisive" female punk burlesque character in the music video. The visual begins with the singer kissing a disco ball in form of a human head in a room with fellow people involved in similar activities. After one of them plays a phonograph record, the song starts and Corina is shown dancing accompanied by male background dancers. Following this, she descends to a club from its ceiling wrapped in a white cloth. After a cameo appearance from JJ, the video continues in a similar way and ends with a reel-to-reel audio tape recording running a reel. Scenes interspersed during the clip's main plot include Corina dancing in front of red numbers, poledancing and lying on the ground while water drops on her. The visual was nominated for Best Video at the 2011 Romanian Music Awards, where Corina performed "No Sleepin'" live.
LaViVe version.
Background and release.
German girl group LaViVe was formed on the of the German adaption of the international television talent show "Popstars" in 2010. The group consists of Meike Ehnert, Sarah Rensing, Julia Köster and Katrin Mehlberg. LaViVe recorded a cover of "No Sleepin'" after a demo version of the song was handed to their management by a Romanian producing team. Their rendition, titled "No Time for Sleeping", was released on a CD single in Germany on 10 December 2010 by Starwatch Music, as licensed by Corina's label. The CD single additionally contains versions of the song recorded by three fellow eliminated contestants on that year's "Popstars".
Reception.
"No Time for Sleeping" received mixed reviews from music critics upon its release. German singer praised the commercial appeal of the song. An editor of German website Promicabana applauded the song and its rap part, although foreseeing the commercial failure of the track. Similarly, "B.Z." criticized "No Time for Sleeping" as repetitive and denied its success.
Commercially, the song — aided by a tour in German-speaking Europe — fared moderately. In Germany, the song entered and peaked at number 13 on the Official German Charts, lasting for eight weeks. Digitally, it was the 14th most-downloaded song in the nation in the week ending 22 December 2010. "No Time for Sleeping" further peaked at numbers 12 and 28 in Austria and Switzerland, remaining for five and one weeks, respectively.
Music video.
An accompanying music video for "No Time for Sleeping" premiered during the night of 9 December 2010, with a snippet shown earlier that day during the "Popstars" finale to choose the final member for LaViVe. During the visual, the group is shown dancing in front of a wall that constantly changes its colors or residing in a club. It was received with mixed reviews from music critics. An editor of praised the visual's playful vibe and pointed out the members' professionality. Conversely, a writer on website Promicabana criticized the video as "trash" and unspectacular, further noting the members' peculiar dance movements. In late December 2010, an alternative version of the clip featuring eliminated "Popstars" candidate Esra Ünvers as part of LaVive was leaked onto the internet, prompting observers to question the show's credibility.

Hear No Evil (1982 film)

Hear No Evil is a 1982 made-for-television-film directed by Harry Falk Jr. and written by Tom Lazarus. The TV film stars Gil Gerard, Bernie Casey, Wings Hauser, Mimi Rogers, Christina Hart, Brion James, Ron Karabatsos, Mickey Jones, Raven De La Croix, and Robert Dryer.
Plot.
After a cop becomes deaf in a fight, he tries to break up a drug ring run by bikers.
Production.
"Hear No Evil" is based on the true story of William O. "Bill" Zerby, a former Marine who, as a Solano County Sherriff's Office narcotics detective, aggressively perused members of the Hells Angels suspected of producing and distributing methamphetamine in the San Francisco Bay Area. Zerby was injured, suffered severe hearing loss and was forced to retire from his law enforcement agency as a result of an explosive device detonated as he was entering his car in front of his home on January 30, 1978. He was en route to court for a prehearing in the methamphetamine possession trial of Oakland Hells Angels chapter vice-president James Ezekiel "Jim-Jim" Brandes at the time. Brandes, who had previously been found to be in possession of a military handbook on booby traps and an address book containing the address, phone number and the license-plate number of Zerby when he was arrested on drug charges by Zerby and another detective on November 14, 1977, stated to a reporter for "Rolling Stone" magazine in or around November 1978 that "Zerby drew a line and stepped over it. I don't take that from anybody in the streets, and I sure ain't gonna take that from him. I don't let nobody come around and shove me around. I don't think anyone does if he's a man." The following year, Brandes and Kenneth Jay "K.O." Owen, a member of the Vallejo Hells Angels who had previously been arrested after a raid on his home led by Zerby uncovered narcotics and prohibited firearms on June 21, 1977, were charged with the attempted murder of Zerby as part of a racketeering case. Brandes and Owen were ultimately acquitted of the attempt on Zerby's life. Brandes later committed suicide by hanging himself in prison circa 1994. Owen died July 4, 2016, and Zerby died in 2021 at the age of seventy-nine.
Producer Paul Pompian heard of the Zerby incident while filming a TV pilot in San Francisco and decided to pursue the idea of translating the events into a teleplay. Paul Pompian Productions and MGM Television produced the television film which could have become a television series.
Reception.
Critical response.
Film critic John J. O'Connor of "The New York Times" wrote in his review: "TRAINING for a new gimmick in the old police-drama formula, "Hear No Evil", tomorrow's television movie on CBS, Channel 2, at 9, comes up with a deaf cop." Staff of the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" wrote: "Gil Gerard as Bill Dragon in a routine cop drama with a banal script and what only approximates acting. Even the central gimmick of permanently deafening the hero in an explosion seems to have been transferred by rubbings from ancient stones."

United States at the World Athletics Championships

The United States has participated in every edition of the World Athletics Championships since the inaugural event in 1983. It has been the most successful nation at the global competition for track and field. By the end of the 2017 World Championships, its athletes had won a total of 352 medals, 155 of them gold – more than double that of the next most successful nation Kenya, as well as more than the combined total of the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states. It has been the top nation in the championships medal table at every edition bar 1983 and 1987 (East Germany), 2001 (Russia) and 2015 (Kenya). It also ranks number one on points in the national placing tables. As one of the foremost nations in the sport internationally, its delegations for the championships are among the largest.
The most decorated athlete of the competition's history is American: Allyson Felix has won sixteen World Championships medals, eleven of them gold, competing across the individual and relay sprint events. Among men, the United States has three of the four most decorated men (after Usain Bolt), all of them sprinters; LaShawn Merritt has eleven medals, Carl Lewis won ten and Michael Johnson won eight. All three won eight gold medals. Johnson is the nation's most successful athlete individually (and the third most successful overall), having won six gold medals in the 200-meter dash and 400-meter dash. American Gail Devers is the second most successful woman individually, with four golds and two silver medals from the 100-meter dash and 100-meter hurdles. Felix and Amy Acuff have made the most appearances for the United States, each having represented their country at eight separate editions.
The United States team was affected by doping during the period from 1997 to 2003, principally in sprinting events. The loss of several gold medals in 2001 resulted in the United States dropping to second in the medal rankings for the first time since 1987.
Best placings.
Of the 50 events that have been held over the history of the championships, 30 have been won by American athletes (17 men's events and 13 women's events). A further 4 men's and 5 women's events have featured an American medallist at some point. Americans have topped the podium in all sprint and hurdles events, as well as all the men's jumps. By far the weakest events of the United States are men's and women's racewalking and women's throws – only four bronze medals have been won by American athletes in these disciplines, among a total of over 350 medals across events. Americans have featured in the final at some point of every discipline contested at the championships.
This table shows the best place finish by an American athlete by event. Where the best position has been achieved multiple times, the first instance is shown.

Nick Papadimitriou

Nick Papadimitriou (born 1958 in Finchley, Middlesex), nicknamed the "London Perambulator" after the short film about him produced by John Rogers in 2009, is a British writer with a keen interest in the topography of the London region.
Biography.
Nick Papadimitriou started to "conscious walk" the region of London in the late 1980s. He describes the activity of walking and exploring as a cathartic phenomenon worth nurturing, and feels that landscapes shape his mind as he progresses onward. He has collected around 2,000 maps and historical documents about the region.
In 2007, Papadimitriou wrote and designed the "Middlesex County Council" website, a collection of articles intended "not only to explore and present the historic legacy of old Middlesex, but also to examine the way in which the county-region still coheres as a distinct entity at the topographic and imaginative levels".
Between 2009 and 2011, Papadimitriou co-hosted, with John Rogers, two series of a radio show on Resonance FM entitled "Ventures and Adventures in Topography". The first series examined a number of early-twentieth-century 'rambling' books which explored the suburbs of London through the eyes of forgotten authors such as S. P. B. Mais and Gordon S. Maxwell, while the second series took a more general if still somewhat esoteric approach to walking in the urban fringes of the capital. Papadimitriou's interest in and identification with the former county of Middlesex featured in a number of these broadcasts. 
In 2013, Nick Papadimitriou published the book "Scarp". Part autobiography, part fiction, part travelogue, and written after decades of hiking and discoveries in and around London, the book focused on the ridge of land to the north of the city's suburbs which Papadimitriou refers to as the "North Middlesex/South Hertfordshire Tertiary Escarpment". Papadimitriou also provided material to Will Self for his book "The Book of Dave".
Filmography.
Papadimitriou was the subject of a documentary film made by John Rogers in 2009 featuring Russell Brand, Will Self and Iain Sinclair, in which he spoke of his practice as "Deep Topography".

Nicolai Abraham Holten

Nicolai Abraham Holten (27 March 1775 - 12 May 1850) was a Danish civil servant in the financial administration and director of Øresund Custom House.
Early life and education.
Holten was born in Copenhagen, the son of customs officer and former pharmacist Johannes (Hans) Holten (1741–1816) and Ane Margrethe Holten née Abildgaard (1747–1826). His grand father was royal furniture maker Johann von Holten and he was named after his maternal uncle Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard.
He attended Efterslægtselskabets Skole from October 1788 to September 1790. He was later educated in Niels Ryberg's trading house.

After completing his education Holten established his own business as a bankier and broker. He collaborated with the government and was in 1816 appointed to specialist director of national debt ("statsgældsdirektør"). He headed to office for foreign payments in 1817–39 and was a member of a commission that made a proposal for the important Negotiable Instrument Act ("veksellov") of 1825. He was also used as a personal advisor on financial matters by Frederick VII.
Holten was appointed to director of Øresund Customs House in Helsingør in 1830 but continued as a member of the governing board of the national debt department until 1848.

Anders Hintze House

The Anders Hintze House, located at 4249 S. 2300 East in Holladay, Utah, was built in c.1863-64. It is a "Type IIA" pair-house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
The house was deemed "significant as an example of Scandinavian vernacular architecture in Utah", and it is one of few houses in the Salt Lake valley surviving from the 1860s. It is a one-story adobe house with a stucco exterior that was applied in the 1940s, when an original scroll-bracketed porch was removed.
It was built by Anders Hintze, who was born in 1821 in Herslex, Roskilde Parish, Denmark, who converted to the LDS church in the 1850s and came to Utah early in the 1860s. The house was home for one of his three wives, Karen Sophie Swenson; the other wives lived in smaller houses on the family property.
A plan of the house and a photograph were exhibited at the Danish Immigrant Museum in 2001. The museum termed it a "three-part house", reflecting it having a central room with side rooms. In this example, the side rooms are two deep.

Lois Fernandez

Lois Fernandez (1936-August 13, 2017) was a political and cultural activist, best known for founding the Odunde Festival in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The festival celebrates African and African-American heritage. It has continued for more than forty years, expanding from one block long to a dozen, and drawing as many as 500,000 people to South Philadelphia.
Fernandez' contributions were publicly applauded in the 2000 "Congressional record : proceedings and debates of the Congress" by the Hon. Robert A. Brady. She was publicly recognized during Women's History Month, March 2009, by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania.
Her memoir "Recollections (part one)" was published in 2016.
Life.
Lois Fernandez was one of 10 children. Her mother was the first black woman to serve as a Democratic party committeewoman in Philadelphia. Her family was high Episcopalian. Lois attended South Philadelphia High School for Girls.
Her first paying job was as a clerk typist at the Philadelphia Quartermaster Depot. The Black Power movement was becoming influential, and Fernandez was an active worker for civil rights and social justice. One outward indicator of her pride in being African was that she cut her hair and let it grow out naturally in an Afro. It was a radical choice at that time, causing her to be ostracized by some of her co-workers.
Fernandez lived in the South Street area of Philadelphia, one of the oldest communities of free African-Americans in the United States, dating back to the 17th century. W. E. B. Du Bois described the area of the Seventh Ward in his ground-breaking sociological work, "The Philadelphia Negro" (1890), recognizing its distinct black identity. In 1963, Fernandez bought her own house on Fernon Street.
In 1966, Lois Fernandez, her sister Sylvia Green, her cousin Gerri Fernandez, and her friend Ruth Arthur opened a boutique, the Uhuru Hut, at 500 South 23rd Street. They felt that a store focused on Afrocentric clothes, jewelry and fine art would complement consciousness raising and increased black cultural awareness. At the same time, she and Ruth Arthur began to think about possibilities for some sort of neighborhood gathering in the area. 
In 1967, Lois Fernandez bore a son as a single mother. She brought forward a lawsuit in federal court and was ultimately successful in having the designation “illegitimate” removed from Pennsylvania birth certificates.
By the 1970s, Fernandez was employed by the Department of Public Welfare. She worked with street gangs in South Philadelphia to decrease violence in the community. Throughout her career she held various positions with the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, including social worker, foster care placement officer, gang prevention worker and parent counselor.
She believed in lifelong learning, and earned an associate degree in applied science from the Community College of Philadelphia, and a master's in urban education from Antioch University. She also earned parent education certification at St. Louis University, certification for AIDS training from the AIDS Activities Coordinating Office, and certification in arts management from the University of Massachusetts. She became an adjunct faculty member at Lincoln University in their master's degree program in human services.
In the 1990s, she noticed the need for senior housing in her neighborhood. She worked with city and state officials and developers to rally support and raise funding. Osun Village, a four-story complex for low-income seniors, opened in South Philadelphia on December 13, 2010. Anna C. Verna, president of the City Council credited Fernandez, stating "This would never, never have become reality without the constant, constant persistence of Lois Fernandez."
Fernandez struggled with ill health during her life. She suffered from rheumatic fever as a child. Later in life she fought rheumatoid arthritis and breast cancer. After hip and knee replacements she had to use a motorized scooter for mobility.
Forming Odunde.
Fernandez had met Nigerian practitioners of the Yoruba religion as early as 1963.
In January 1972, Fernandez traveled to Oshogbo, Nigeria, West Africa, where she was inspired by the Oshun Festival of the Yoruba people. 
She visited the Osun River with Nigerian artist Twins Seven-Seven as part of a local celebration honoring Oshun, and thought that something similar could be done with Philadelphia's rivers.
After returning to Philadelphia, Fernandez and her friend Ruth Arthur organized the first Odunde Festival. It took place in April 1975, 
as the "Oshun Festival".
Their goal was to bring together the community and to foster awareness of and pride in black history and culture. 
The first procession started from Fernandez's house on Madison Square. 
The officiant was Obailumi Ogunsey, a Yoruba priest who Fernandez had met in 1963. 
Fernandez invited choreographer Arthur L. Hall and his dance troupe to participate.
Fernandez' idea for a community procession was initially met with expressions of disbelief. Some members of the black community were incredulous at the idea that the city would give a black parade permission to stop traffic. "Ain't gonna let nobody go across that bridge, shut off that bridge and let y'all walk to the river." Others were afraid of gang violence, but the actual event was both successful and peaceful.
In 1975, their first year, they received $100 from the Philadelphia's Southwest Center City Community Council and raised some neighborhood donations. 
The second year, they were awarded a $5,000 grant by Councilman John Anderson. From then on, the festival expanded rapidly.
By Odunde's second decade, there was some opposition from people who found it too large and too loud. Fernandez strenuously and successfully opposed attempts to move the Odunde Festival from its original location. She emphasized the importance of keeping it in its neighborhood, close to its cultural roots. Its closest analog in the city was the Mummer's Parade which had formed out of white ethnic neighborhoods in the Seventh Ward around 1900. The local tradition of public parades also included African American Elks Lodge parades, and Catholic saint's parades. Fernandez identified gentrification as an impetus behind attempts to move the festival, and pointed out the racism of responding differently to white and black-based traditions. By creating Odunde and repeatedly emphasizing its place in a continuum of African-American history on South Street, Fernandez played an important role in the reappropriation of South Street and its signification as an important black cultural space. The Odunde Festival has provided an important source of visible continuity in the African and African-American community.
In 1983, South Philadelphia-based ODUNDE Inc. was formed to support local cultural activity. The name ODUNDE comes from a Yoruba language word meaning “Happy New Year”. 
Fernandez served for many years as president of ODUNDE Inc., while her daughter, Oshunbumi Fernandez served as executive director. 
During this time, Fernandez and ODUNDE worked with the Philadelphia Folklore Project to document and preserve African American art and culture from South Philadelphia.
In 1996, Lois Fernandez turned over the work of building an African-American cultural movement to her daughter Oshunbumi Fernandez. Oshunbumi Fernandez was a year old when her mother led the first ODUNDE festival.
ODUNDE traditions.
Held on the second Sunday in June, the celebration is now the largest African celebration on the east coast of the United States, and one of the "largest and longest-running African American street festivals" in the United States.
It begins with a procession, usually starting from Twenty-Third and South Streets, over the South Street Bridge to the Schuylkill.
There fruit, flowers, honey and other offerings are thrown into the river to honor the Yoruba river orisha Oshun.
Participants tend to wear white or dress in traditional African clothing. They are accompanied by drummers, dancers, and vendors. After ceremonies at the river, the procession returns to a festival area, reminiscent of a Nigerian market, for music and other entertainment. Entertainers often perform at both South Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, and have included international artists such as drummer Babatunde Olatunji.
Autobiography.
Lois Fernandez worked with folklorist Debora Kodish to publish a memoir of her early life in South Philadelphia in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s: "Recollections (part one)" (2016). It was released in 2016 with signings at the Mayor's reception room in Philadelphia City Hall, and the African American Museum in Philadelphia.
Death.
Lois Fernandez died peacefully at home on August 13, 2017. 
Several hundred people attended her "home-going service" at the Universal Audenried Charter High School. They included musician Kenny Gamble, 
radio personality Patty Jackson, City Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and state Representatives Bob Brady and Jordan A. Harris.

Representative Central Band of the Polish Armed Forces

The Representative Central Band of the Polish Armed Forces (Polish: Orkiestra Reprezentacyjna Wojska Polskiego) is a military music unit that provides musical accompaniment for official state ceremonies in the Republic of Poland. The musicians of the band are required to play ceremonial music for visiting heads of state as well as perform during national events. Since the establishment of the Third Republic in 1989, the band has become chief among its other counterparts, including the Warsaw Capital Garrison Band and the Representative Band of the Polish Land Forces. It is currently attached to the 1st Guards Battalion, Representative Honor Guard Regiment (the honor guard unit of the armed forces).
History.
The history of the Representative Band of the Polish Army goes back to the time of the Polish Legions in 1918. The band was founded in 1963 as part of the Polish People's Army. On 19 August of that same year, it was given the honorary name Central Band of the Polish Armed Forces "Józef Wybicki", in honor of the author of the Polish national anthem ("Poland Is Not Yet Lost"). In 1984, it obtained its current status as the "Representative Band" of the armed forces, and in 1993, in accordance with the order from Minister of National Defense Janusz Onyszkiewicz, it was officially renamed from the Band of the LWP to the band of the newly reformed Polish Armed Forces. It was enlarged in the spring of 2018 to 120 members, making it one of the largest in Europe.
Events.
Regimental events.
On 31 March 2018, the band performed during the battalion's official renaming ceremony, following an Armed Forces-wide reorganization of ceremonial units. Exactly a year later, a ceremony of the Presentation of Colours took place at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw with President Andrzej Duda as the presiding officer.
Receptions.
The band takes part in the ceremonial reception and state arrival ceremonies at the Presidential Palace for visiting presidents and the Chancellery for visiting prime ministers, rendering honors and performing the anthems of the two countries present. After the anthems are performed, the band plays "Marsz Generalski" during the guard inspection and "Warszawianka" during the marchpast. In between the performance of the two marches, the band performs a series of ceremonial pieces. During the marchpast, the band always leads the honor guard while the drum major and director salute.
Armed Forces Day.
It provides musical accompaniment for the annual Armed Forces Day parade on Ujazdów Avenue.
Independence Day.
It provides musical accompaniment for the annual National Independence Day ceremony on Piłsudski Square. A fanfare team from the band is present as soldiers unfurl the Flag of Poland before another fanfare is sounded and musicians of the band alongside singers of the Symphony Orchestra and Choir of the Armed Forces, perform the National Anthem. The Armed Forces Memorial Fanfare (Haslo Wojska Polskiego) is also sounded and after the wreath laying ceremony, "Spij Kolego" is played by a lone trumpeter of the band. Other musical pieces include "We Are the First Brigade", which is the march of the Polish Land Forces.
Foreign events.
It has participated in many international music festivals around the world, including festivals in Austria, Belgium, France, Georgia, Germany, the United States, Italy and Russia. In September 2000 they participated at the Norwegian Military Tattoo and in 2012, it took part in the Russian Armed Forces's Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo in Moscow. In June 2014, the band participated in the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy in Caen, France. Every September, the band performs at the a parade of Polish-Americans in downtown Chicago at the invitation of the Polish Consulate General. In October 2014, members of the band performed at the Birmingham Tattoo in England.
Uniform.
The band usually performs in the uniform of the Representative Honor Guard Regiment, while on special holidays and military tattoo performances the musicians of the central band dress up in historical uniforms from the era of the Duchy of Warsaw.

Shakespeare's Planet

Shakespeare's Planet is a 1976 science-fiction novel by Clifford D. Simak.
Plot.
Carter Horton and three other crew members are sent on an interstellar mission to find a planet which would be suitable for human life. They are put into suspended animation until they arrive. However, due to a systems malfunction, Carter is the last one left alive. When he makes it to the planet he finds that he has been in deep sleep for about 1,000 years. The ship is controlled by the minds of three volunteers, a monk, a scientist and a grande dame, who gave up their bodies as a way to control the ship. 
Upon awakening, Carter finds that the ship refuses to return to Earth. He meets the ship's robot, Nicodemus, but the only living thing he encounters is the alien Carnivore, who claims he came there through a time tunnel. He also states that he had a previous companion on the planet, a human named Shakespeare. Shakespeare took his name from a book of plays.
Others arrive via the time tunnel; however, it is much more difficult to leave the planet in that manner. Several other alien species are also discovered living on the planet.
Review.
"SF Book Reviews" found the book lacking action and more interested in character actions or reactions to each other or their surroundings. Ideas are presented by the spaceship’s three minds or personalities in their own private discourses.

CCDC88C (gene)

Coiled-coil domain containing 88C is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CCDC88C gene.
Function.
This gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed coiled-coil domain-containing protein that interacts with the dishevelled protein and is a negative regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway. The protein encoded by this gene has a PDZ domain binding motif in its C-terminus, with which it interacts with the dishevelled protein. Dishevelled is a scaffold protein involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway.
The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in embryonic development, tissue, and cancer progression. Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive, primary non-syndromic congenital hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain (provided by RefSeq, Jan 2013).

Joe Hung

Joe Hung (; February 15, 1932 – February 20, 2018) was a Taiwanese journalist, diplomat, and translator. He served as a foreign correspondent for the Central News Agency (CNA) from 1974 until 1989, as well as the President of CNA from 1990 until 1992 and chairman from 1992 to 1993 and again 2009 until 2011. Hung also joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' diplomatic corp during the 1990s. He served as the Representative of Taiwan to Italy from 1993 until 2000.
Early life and education.
Hung was born on February 15, 1932 in Tamsui, Taiwan, to a professionally successful family. His father worked for the Bank of Taiwan branch in Banqiao District. Hung was raised in Taiwan under Japanese rule before and during World War II. As a result, Hung was fluent in Japanese, as well as Mandarin Chinese and English. Hung considered his mother language Japanese, followed by English and Mandarin in order of proficiency. He was educated by the Japanese prior to their defeat in 1945 during his sophomore year in high school. He spoke Japanese so fluently that he later served as the Japanese interpreter for President Lee Teng-hui. Hung and his wife only conversed in Japanese at home until the birth of their first child, when they added Taiwanese Hokkien to their household.
Hung studied foreign languages and literature at National Taiwan University until his graduation in 1950. He served as an English-language interpreter in the Republic of China Armed Forces for five years, where he coordinated the communications with American troops stationed on Taiwan.
Hung moved to the United States, where he received his master's degree in journalism from Southern Illinois University in 1965. Two decades later, Hung obtained a doctorate in history from Georgetown University in Washington D.C. in 1981.
Career.
He reported for United Press International (UPI) from the late 1960s until the early 1970s.
Hung also worked for "The China Post", an English-language newspaper based in Taiwan, where he served as chief editor. During his tenure as "The China Post"'s chief editor, a major typhoon struck Taiwan. Hung was one of just two newspaper employees who made it to work at the "Post" during the typhoon. According to Jack Huang, the then-director of the newspaper, Hung edited the entire newspaper himself during the storm so that the daily paper could be published the next day.
In 1974, Hung began work for the Central News Agency (CNA), the state news agency for the Republic of China (Taiwan). He served as a CNA correspondent in Jordan from 1974 to 1977, Washington D.C. from 1977 to 1980, Houston, Texas, from 1980 to 1983, Tokyo from 1983 until 1987, and London from 1987 until 1989.
In 1990, Hung was named President of CNA, a position he held until 1992. He was also appointed chairman of CNA for two separate tenures: 1992–1993 and again from 2009 until 2011.
Hung joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a diplomat in the 1990s. He served as the Representative of Taiwan to Italy from 1993 until 2000. According to colleagues and aides, Hung, a talented linguist, took only a week to master the Italian language. Hung maintained good personal and professional relations with Italian officials, which led to an agreement to allow Taiwanese airlines to fly to Italy. Hung also oversaw the opening of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, known Ufficio di Rappresentanza di Taipei in Italia, during his tenure as Representative.
Hung later worked with Stephen S. F. Chen, another diplomat and politician, at the National Policy Foundation, a think tank affiliated with the Kuomintang.
In 2010, Hung released the first ever English-language translation of the works of Lai He, a native Taiwanese poet and writer. Hung was chosen for the translation due to his experience as a linguist, translator and historian. The first English-language volume of Lai He's work, "Lai He Fiction", a collection of twenty-one short stories translated by Hung, was published as a series of columns in "The China Post" before release as a book on October 22, 2010. The project was funded by the Central News Agency and the Hakka Affairs Council.
In 2011, Hung published his book, "A New History of Taiwan", inspired by Lian Heng's "General History of Taiwan". He decried Taiwan's political divisions in the book, which he argued hindered the country's development. Additionally, he trained translators and taught journalism at several Taiwanese universities.
Death.
Hung was diagnosed in January 2018 with rectal cancer that had spread to the kidneys. He was admitted to the hospital in January and underwent surgery, which initially proved successful. However, Hung suffered a heart attack and pulmonary infection during his recovery. Joe Hung died from complications of heart and lung disease at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital on February 20, 2018, at the age of 86. His funeral was held on March 6, 2018, at the Taipei Municipal Second Funeral Parlor.

Enemy in the House

Enemy in the House is a murder mystery novel by Mignon G. Eberhart published by Random House in 1962. It was reprinted in 1976 by I. Henry ().
Plot.
The action takes place in South Carolina and Jamaica during the time of the American Revolution. Amity Mallam, the daughter of a plantation-owning family, enters a secret marriage in order to protect her inheritance. Her journey is set in motion when two of the ceremony's attendees, the priest and a lawyer, are murdered. Once in Jamaica, Amity, along with her father and her brother, are aided by a beautiful Obeah slave woman named Selene.
Background.
Eberhart is thought to have used her experience traveling through Jamaica in the 1940s to develop this novel. This same trip was used by the author to flesh out the atmosphere of "Speak No Evil".
Reception.
In his essay on queer coding in Eberhart's novels, Rick Cypert points to the character of Neville as a character who is typical of her depictions of subtextually-gay male characters. Cypert and co-author James McManaway single out the character of Selene for notability as one of only two non-white characters in Eberhart's later work who perform any sort of detective work; the only other Eberhart novel to boast such a character is "El Rancho Rio" (1970).

Wolf in Man's Clothing is a mystery novel by Mignon G. Eberhart. It was published by Random House in 1942 and issued in the UK by Collins Crime Club the following year. It was reissued by Bison Books in 1996.
This sixth novel featuring nurse Sarah Keate is the only one in which only Sarah appears, and not Lt. Lance O’Leary. It's also one of the few which also was not made into a film. The sales of the book, however, were so strong that her editor Harry Maule urged her to write one more Sarah Keate story.
Plot Summary.
Set during World War II, nurse Sarah Keate and nurse Drue Cable investigate the suspicious shooting of Drue's millionaire ex-husband. While he is being treated and lying unconscious, someone in his family household, a gloomy mansion in the remote countryside is suspected of plotting to kill him.
Reception.
Isaac Anderson of the "New York Times" gave the novel a positive review, saying that "the story is so absorbing that one can easily forgive Mrs. Eberhart for her curiously involved manner of telling it, a manner which makes for slow reading." Despite a slow start, Anderson felt that the last act of the film moved rapidly and that the rapidly and that the romantic elements "served to increase and accentuate the suspense," rather than detracting from the plot.

List of historic properties in Agua Caliente, Arizona

This is a list which includes a photographic gallery, of some of the remaining ruins of historic significance in Agua Caliente, a ghost town in Arizona. Agua Caliente was once a small town in southern Maricopa County, Arizona. The small town evolved around the establishment of the Agua Caliente Resort. Also, included in the gallery is the Agua Caliente Pioneer Cemetery.
Brief history.
Before the arrival of the European settlers in the region the area was home to the Tonto Apache tribe. They were the first to enjoy the natural hot spring waters which flowed in the area. Around 1748 and 1750, the Spanish missionaries arrived in the area and called it Agua Caliente which is Spanish for "hot water". Arizona belonged to Mexico until the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the 1853 Gadsden Purchase clearly defined the U.S–Mexican boundaries.
In 1858, a stagecoach station of the Butterfield Overland Mail was established in the "Flap-Jack Ranch". It was located six miles from the Agua Caliente hot springs along the Gila River, 84 miles from Fort Yuma.
King S. Woolsey, an American pioneer rancher, Indian-fighter, prospector and politician in 19th century Arizona owned a ranch where the hot spring waters were located. On one occasion John Ross Browne and Charles Debrille Poston a.k.a. "Father of Arizona", due to his efforts lobbying for creation of the territory, visited and stayed in Woolsey's ranch. According to John Ross Browne: "We had a glorious bath in the springs next morning." By 1873, word had spread about the hot springs and many visitors, which included miners and cowboys went there.
In 1897, a 22-room resort was built where Woolsey once had his ranch. It was named the "Agua Caliente Hotel". Arizona's first elected governor George W. P. Hunt was among those who visited and stayed in the hotel in the late 1800s. Various stone houses were built in the area, which included a store, saloon and residences. Plus, the small town also had a cemetery.
Decline of Auga Caliente.
The over-irrigation of the farms and ranches nearby may have been one of the causes for which the water of the springs dried up. During World War II, a swimming pool was built for the use of the officers of nearby Camp Horn. However, once the war was over and the Arizona State Highways 85 and I-8 were built and bypassed Agua Caliente, the town was deserted and eventually became a ghost town.
Historic structures and artifacts.
The following are the images of the Agua Caliente Resort and some of the ruins in Agua Caliente.

The Melody Lingers On (Etta Jones album)

 The Melody Lingers On is an album by vocalist Etta Jones featuring tributes to jazz vocalists, which was recorded in late 1996 and released on the HighNote label the following year.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow states: "On "The Melody Lingers On", Etta Jones pays tribute to ten departed members of show business, with one song apiece saluting Phyllis Hyman, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, Sammy Davis, Jr, Billy Eckstine, Alberta Hunter and Sarah Vaughan. The singer does not attempt to emulate any of these greats, and instead sings in her own soulful bluesy style. ... Fine music."

List of shipyard locations on the Hooghly River in the early 19th Century

The following list is based on locations listed in Phipps (1840). The locations are listed in order as one goes down the Hooghly River towards the river's mouth. The name in the first column of the table is the name one encounters most frequently in British East India Company (EIC) sources. East and West in the table refer to the banks of the river.
After the construction of the Strand Road, in the 1820s, shipbuilding was concentrated at Sulkea, Howrah, and Kidderpore. The greatest shipbuilding years on the Hooghly up to 1839 were 1813 (21 vessels and 10,376 tons (bm)), 1801 (19 vessels and 10,079 tons (bm)), and 1816 (18 vessels and 8,198 tons (bm)).

Thuesen-Petersen House

The Thuesen-Petersen House, located at 260 W. Center St. in Scipio, Utah, is a historic pair-house which was built in c.1870. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
It was deemed "significant as an example of Scandinavian vernacular architecture in Utah" in its historic site inventory form, which describes it:This house is an example of the TYPE IV pair house, a type distinguished by the presence of an indented porch on the facade. The house is built of a locally fired, yellow brick with the walls laid in a common bond fashion. Originally the house was only a single story and had straight gable roof and stove chimneys paired internally on the ridge. The distinctive second story which stands today was added in 1887. Expanding the house here simply meant adding a second story gabled room to each of the existing three bays. The house mixes Greek Revival and Victorian stylistic impulses.
It was built by John Thuesen, who was born near Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1843. He and his family joined the LDS church in 1856, and he immigrated to Utah in 1866.
The house is also associated with Jens Petersen, who was born in Ramsin, Hvidbjerg, Denmark in 1860, and who immigrated to Utah in 1875 with his father Niels and brother Andreas. They were unusual because they were not LDS church members, but apparently were attracted to Utah based on reports from Danish Mormons who had come to Utah earlier. Jens bought this house in 1879, the three lived there, then in 1887 Jens added the second story and also built a store on the property. The store was detached and moved to Main Street in 1936.

Asahi-class destroyer

The "Asahi" class of destroyers of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force is optimized for undersea warfare. The class was initially designated "25DD", referring to a date on the Japanese calendar, specifically the 25th fiscal year of the Heisei period (2013).
The lead ship, "Asahi", is the third ship to hold the name after the "Asahi"-class destroyer escort lent from the United States Navy in 1955, and the Imperial Japanese battleship. The second ship of the class, "Shiranui", is the third ship to hold the name after the "Murakumo" and "Kagerō"-class destroyers.
Development.
The procurement of the destroyer began in 2013 in response to the reduction in the number of destroyers (namely the ) within the JMSDF. The two major characteristics of this destroyer is its bigger emphasis on anti-submarine warfare and the adoption of the COGLAG (combined gas turbine electric and gas turbine: a modification of the combined gas and gas propulsion system employing electric propulsion system for low-speed cruising) propulsion system. A second destroyer was procured a year later.
Design.
The "Asahi" class is based on the existing to reduce acquisition cost and allow future development and growth. Unlike the "Akizuki" class (which focuses on anti-aircraft warfare) the "Asahi" class focuses on anti-submarine warfare.
Features.
The "Asahi" class is the first Japanese warship to be equipped with a COGLAG propulsion system. This allows the destroyer to be more fuel efficient than previous warships. Another unique feature about this destroyer is the usage of a GaN-AESA (gallium nitride - active electronically scanned array) Multifunction Radar. The "Asahi" class is the second Japanese class of warship to be outfitted with this technology (the "Akizuki" class was the first). The destroyer's radar is based on the FCS-3A radar used for the "Akizuki" class and uses gallium nitride to improve performance. In radar technology, gallium nitride offers a number of advantages over the traditionally used gallium arsenide (GaA). These advantages include higher power density, efficiency, thermal spreading and frequency coverage. This in turn allows the GaN chip to be smaller than their GaA counterpart, thus reducing cost and increasing overall cost effectiveness.

Urda (journal)

 
Urda was a Norwegian antiquities and history journal published from 1834 to 1849 by the University Museum of Bergen, which wanted to convey what the museum had collected since its opening in 1825. Its editorial board included the Storting representative and attorney Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie, Bishop Jacob Neumann, and the educator Lyder Sagen.
The first volume of the journal was produced in four issues from 1834 to 1837, containing 39 articles altogether. Volume two appeared in 1842 with four issues containing 31 articles. The journal was printed by the company Chr. Dahl R.S., headed by Christopher Dahl, who in 1820 had taken over the press previously owned by his father, Rasmus Dahl. The expensive paper for the journal, which was imported from Copenhagen, and problems with the primitive printing technology resulted in the failure of the third issue. An important reason for the journal's failure also lay in the fact that the members of the journal's editorial team, who were also the most important contributors to "Urda", had retired. A further problem for the journal was the high cost of distributing it to its subscribers, which included the king in Stockholm and to the Ministry of Church and Education in Kristiania.

Space Cowboy (Kacey Musgraves song)

"Space Cowboy" is a song by American country singer and songwriter Kacey Musgraves, released as a single from her fourth studio album "Golden Hour" on February 23, 2018.
Background.
In February 2018, Musgraves posted a photo with the caption: "One day I was out at the barn watching this stallion charging powerfully from one end of the arena to the other, bucking and galloping at full speed all alone. Though I was 'safe' on the other side of the arena wall, it kinda scared me when he came flying toward me..barely stopping in time. My riding teacher saw him coming at me and yelled at me to move away. I said 'I'm fine! The gate is closed!' to which she said, 'Girl – when they wanna go they will go…there ain't no point in even shuttin' the gate.' It really made a mark on me when she said that and I wrote it down. Space Cowboy came a couple days after with Shane McAnally and Luke Laird ✨Make peace with what doesn't belong. You'll find something better."
Critical reception.
The song received universal acclaim. Chris DeVille from "Stereogum" wrote, "The melody is so gorgeously wistful, the wordplay so subtly pristine, the heartache so profound. Also, given that it actually sounds like a country song floating through outer space, we all ought to stand up and applaud the levels of compositional genius."
Commercial performance.
On March 10, 2018, "Space Cowboy" peaked at number 30 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart. The song has spent eight weeks on the chart. 
On August 3, 2020, the single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and streaming data of over 500,000 units in the United States.
Composition.
"Space Cowboy" is originally in the key of D-flat major, with a tempo of 117 beats per minute. Written in common time, Musgraves vocal range spans from A3 to C5 during the song. Musgraves is saying that she is "okay" with her significant other leaving for some time. She recognizes the fact that they had their good times together, but it is time to move on because it is the best for the both of them. He is claiming he needs space, and she is willing to give it to him because their love has "faded".
Live performances.
Musgraves performed the song for the first time on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon". She also performed the single on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show".
Music video.
A music video for the single "Space Cowboy" was released on April 30, 2018. "Rolling Stone" described it as: "Filmed in Mexico City by director Courtney Phillips, the cinematic video tells its story through color and shadow while Musgraves' wounded ballad slowly transforms into an empowering anthem. Her post-romance world is hazy and clouded at first, confined to empty rooms with broken windows while her ex gallops through a tropical village. But the power dynamic soon shifts, with golden rays of morning sun shining down on Musgraves and black clouds gathering over her now-disillusioned cowboy." The video has over six million views on YouTube.

High Horse (Kacey Musgraves song)

"High Horse" is a song written and recorded by American country music singer and songwriter Kacey Musgraves for her fourth studio album, "Golden Hour" (2018). Musgraves co-wrote the song with Trent Dabbs and Tom Schleiter, and co-produced the track with Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian. It was first released as a digital promotional single on March 22, 2018, and later impacted American hot adult contemporary radio on June 25, 2018, as the album's third official single. An extended play of remixes was issued on July 3, 2018.
"High Horse" reached number 36 on the US "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart and also became Musgraves's first song to crossover to pop radio, debuting and peaking at number 39 on the Adult Pop Songs airplay chart.
Content.
"High Horse" is a disco song which incorporates elements of country instrumentation and layered vocals. The song utilizes synths and a "spritely" disco beat, with the overall sound being described by "Rolling Stone" as the "most radical departure yet" from Musgraves's previous releases. The Bee Gees and Daft Punk are cited as influences on the style of "High Horse". Lyrically, the song utilizes word play and double entendres to compare a conceited individual to a prized horse, who Musgraves encourages to "giddy-up" and "ride straight out of this town."
Critical reception.
Margaret Farrell of "Pitchfork" praised the song's word play and fusion of disco and country sounds, writing that Musgraves "sure makes a great pop star," and "has opened up a fascinating new door for herself." Jude Rogers of "The Guardian" singled out "High Horse" as a highlight of Musgraves's concert at the Bristol Hippodrome in the United Kingdom, writing that the track "shows how country can be melded brilliantly with late-70s, Chic-like disco, pointing towards a style with which Musgraves could truly conquer the world." Michael Watkins of "Under the Radar" praised the songwriting on the track, writing that "tracks like "Butterflies" and "High Horse" offer the best of what Musgraves can do in terms of balancing her obvious charm against a certain steely underbelly."
