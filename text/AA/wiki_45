Damodar Ganesh Bapat

Damodar Ganesh Bapat (1935 or 1936 – 17 August 2019) was an Indian social worker known for his service to the leprosy patients at Bhartiya Kushta Nivarak Sangh (BKNS) in Janjgir–Champa district, Chhattisgarh, India. In 2018, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his social work. He was also awarded the Chhattisgarh Rajya Alankar by the state of Chhattisgarh.
Early life.
Bapat was born in the Pathrot village in Amravati district in Maharashtra, India in 1935 or 1936. He completed his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Commerce degrees from Nagpur. After completing his studies, he worked at several places. He was not happy with his jobs and was interested in social work.
Social work.
In 1970, he moved to Jashpur, in Chhattisgarh, and started volunteering with Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram which works in rural areas in India. Initially he worked there as a teacher for the tribal children. While teaching he also met leprosy patients and remained there to serve them throughout his life.
He came in contact with Sadashiv Katre who had founded a community in 1962, named Bharatiya Kushtha Nivarak Sangh (BKNS) at village Sothi located from Champa, to care for leprosy patients. Bapat along with Katre worked together to cure the leprosy patients as well as their social and financial rehabilitation. In 1975, Bapat was appointed as the secretary of Bharatiya Kushtha Nivarak Sangh, and its growth thereafter is credited to him. From 1972 until his death in 2019, he served leprosy patients. He also worked to improve public awareness about leprosy. "Dainik Jagran" reported in 2019 that he had improved the lives of an estimated 26,000 leprosy patients.
Awards.
In 2018, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri in recognition of his social work. He was awarded the Chhattisgarh Rajya Alankar by the state of Chhattisgarh. Shri Badabazar Kumar Sabha Pustakalaya in Kolkata awarded him the Vivekananda Seva Puraskar; Bhaurao Deoras Foundation awarded him Bhaurao Deoras Seva Smruti Puraskar.
On 12 September 2006, he was awarded the tenth Devi Ahilyabai National Award by Shri Ahilyotsav Samiti in Indore for his work in the rehabilitation, education and improvement in health of leprosy patients and making them self-reliant.
Death.
In July 2019, Bapat suffered a brain hemorrhage after which he was admitted to a Hospital in Bilaspur. He died on 17 August 2019 at 2:35 a.m. at a hospital in Chhattisgarh at the age of 84 years. He donated his body to Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur for research purposes.
The Governor of Chhattisgarh, Anusuiya Uikey and Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel condoled his death appreciating his work in serving leprosy patients.

Evidence lower bound

In statistics, the evidence lower bound (ELBO, also variational lower bound or negative variational free energy) is a quantity which is often optimized in Variational Bayesian methods. These methods handle cases where a distribution formula_1 over unobserved variables formula_2 is optimized as an approximation to the true posterior formula_3, given observed data formula_4. Then the "evidence lower bound" is defined as:
formula_5
where formula_6 is cross-entropy. Maximizing the evidence lower bound minimizes formula_7, the Kullback–Leibler divergence, a measure of dissimilarity of formula_1 from the true posterior. The primary reason why this quantity is preferred for optimization is that it can be computed without access to the posterior, given a good choice of formula_1.
For other measures of dissimilarity to be optimized to fit formula_1 see Divergence (statistics).
Justification as a lower bound on the evidence.
The name evidence lower bound is justified by analyzing a decomposition of the KL-divergence between the true posterior and formula_1:
formula_12
As formula_13 this equation shows that the evidence lower bound is indeed a lower bound on the log-evidence formula_14 for the model considered. As formula_14 does not depend on formula_1 this equation additionally shows that maximizing the evidence lower bound on the right minimizes formula_7, as claimed above.

Salah Farah

Salah Abdow Farah was a Kenyan teacher who lost his life after defending his fellow passengers on a bus. He survived the December 2015 attack but died on January 18, 2016, from complications after a surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his hip. His story of courage inspired the short film "Watu Wote" by Katja Benrath. At the time of his death, Farah was the Deputy Headteacher of Mandera Township Primary School.
Background.
On 20 December 2015, Farah was in a bus bound for the town of Mandera in northern Kenya. The bus was attacked by suspected Al-Shabaab militants. In a similar attack the year before, the attackers had separated passengers according to faith. Those who could prove they were Muslim, by reciting passages from the Quran, were spared. Those who couldn't were lined up and shot. 28 people were killed, with the only person, Douglas Ochwodho, surviving by a stroke of luck.
Farah's bus was stopped near the town of El-Wak on the Kenya–Somali border. Knowing what would happen, female Muslim passengers gave their head scarves to the non-Muslims on the bus. Then Farah and other passengers refused to be separated, telling the attackers to "..."kill all of us or leave us alone"."
Death.
For his act of defiance, he was shot in the hand and hip. Two other male passengers were fatally shot, as well as an off-duty policeman who happened to be in a different car. The militants then escaped, leaving Farah critically injured. He was airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment where he died one month later during surgery. His body was airlifted by a police helicopter to his home, where he was buried in a quiet ceremony.
Personal life.
Farah was married to Dunia Mohammed Ahmed. They had four children, and his wife was pregnant with a fifth, at the time of his death. Kenyans launched an online fundraising activity, christened #HeroSalah, to raise money to support his young family.
Legacy and Film.
In an interview before his death, Farah said ""It's only the religion that is the difference, so I ask my brother Muslims to take care of the Christians so that the Christians also take care of us... and let us help one another and let us live together peacefully"."
He was posthumously awarded The Order of the Grand Warrior - one of Kenya's highest civilian honours during the subsequent State of the Nation address. The Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, said Farah "...is a costly reminder that we all have a role to protecting our freedoms."
Farah's story received international coverage, attracting the attention of German actress and filmmaker Katja Benrath. Benrath chose the story for her graduation project, which became the film "Watu Wote: All of Us." The critically acclaimed film won an award at the Student Academy Award, and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.

Sara Rowbotham is a local councillor, community leader and former health worker in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, notable for helping to expose the child sex abuse ring there. She has served as Deputy leader of Rochdale Borough Council since 2018, and was first elected to represent North Middleton in 2015. She is also the Cabinet Member for Health and Wellbeing. And a member of the Labour Party.
Rowbotham was born in Middleton, Greater Manchester. Both her parents were socialists. 
Between 2004 and 2014, she worked for the Rochdale Crisis Intervention Team for the NHS, which is when she uncovered the Rochdale child sex abuse ring and helped bring the perpetrators to court. As a front line sexual health worker, who led the NHS crisis team, she made 181 referrals detailing the abuse and sexual grooming of young people between 2005 and 2011. In 2012 she told the Rochdale inquiry her bosses had ignored scores of warnings that girls were being groomed and sexually exploited. She was made redundant two years later, in 2014. She was portrayed in "Three Girls", a BBC mini-series about the Rochdale child sex abuse ring, by actress Maxine Peake. Following the screening in mid-May 2017, a petition was started at Change.org calling for her to be formally recognized for her services to Rochdale community. By late May, it had gathered more than 275,000 signatures.
In May 2017, she featured on an episode of "First Dates". She received a Special Recognition at the 2018 NHS Heroes Awards, and was made an honorary member of the Council of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in October 2018.

2018 LFL US season

The 2018 LFL US Season is the ninth season of the Legends Football League (LFL) in the United States. It began on 14 April 2018, and ended on 11 August. 
The Chicago Bliss beat the Austin Acoustic 28–20 in the Legends Cup to win their fourth title, finishing with a perfect 6–0 season.
Developments.
In November 2017, it was announced that the Nashville Knights would join the LFL, and begin its inaugural season in the league for the 2018 season, with former Seattle Mist tight end Danika Brace named as the Knights’ head coach. The Pittsburgh Rebellion did not compete in the 2018 season while they conducted a search for a new home venue. They were expected to rejoin the LFL in 2019 but did not.
Nashville's recruitment also resulted in a rule change concerning free agency. Nashville recruited seven of the starters from defending champion Seattle, essentially transplanting the Mist's lineup to a new team nearly intact. This move prompted the league to institute a rule only allowing five free agents per team. As a result of this rule change, Nashville was forced to turn away two of their free agency recruits who returned to Seattle. Nashville courted further controversy when Seattle's former coach, who had retired in the off-season, reappeared as the offensive coordinator of the Knights.
The LFL partnered with Planet Sport to broadcast LFL games in eastern Europe. The partnership allows Planet Sport to broadcast LFL games and ancillary programming from July 2018 through August 2021.
In January 2018, the LFL announced individual and/or group ownership of existing and future franchises beginning with the 2018 season, continuing to build out the LFL US league, while also developing planned strategies for the revivals of LFL Canada and LFL Australia, as well as to start a new European league in the future.
The 2018 season also saw a major uniform change. The players' uniforms now featured leggings instead of shorts. While the league, players, and many fans saw this as a good change there was a vocal segment of the fan base, as well as a group of players, that objected to the leggings. As a result of the outcry, the LFL changed to shorts, consisting of the same patterns as the pants and 2-3 inches longer than the original bikini brief, for the remainder of the season.
Standings.

Playoffs.
Conference Championships were played on August 25, 2018 at Toyota Park in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois. The season concluded with the Legends Cup, played on September 8, 2018, at the H-E-B Center in Cedar Park, Texas. 
The Los Angeles Temptation were the first team in LFL history to qualify for the playoffs with a losing record but only if the 2016 Atlanta team is considered to have finished 2-2 courtesy of a New England forfeit instead of the 1-2-1 record that a lack of a contest would create.
In their first playoff appearance, the Austin Acoustic defeated Los Angeles 32-30 to advance to their first Legends Cup. Hours later, the Chicago Bliss defeated the Nashville Knights 18-6 to secure their sixth trip to the Legends Cup.
The Legends Cup featured Chicago as heavy favorites. The Bliss scored twice in the second quarter and led 12-0 at the half. Austin scored in the third quarter to cut the lead to 12-8 before Chicago added two more scores to extend their lead to 28-8. As the game wound down, Austin rallied with two touchdowns of their own leaving the final score 28-20. With the win, Chicago became the first team in the LFL to win forty games (a cumulative 40-10-1 record) and four championships (2013, 2014, 2016, and 2018). Chicago running back Javell Thompson, who scored three of the Bliss' four touchdowns, was named MVP of the Legends Cup.

Alliance of American Football

The Alliance of American Football (AAF) was a professional American football league. The AAF consisted of eight centrally owned and operated teams in the southern and western United States, seven of which were located in metropolitan areas with at least one major professional sports franchise.
Founded by Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian in 2018, the AAF began play on February 9, 2019, six days after the National Football League's (NFL) Super Bowl LIII championship game. The league was scheduled to have a 10-week regular season and conclude with a championship game on April 27. After eight weeks of play, however, the league's football operations were suspended by controlling owner Thomas Dundon on April 2. Two days later, the AAF allowed players to leave their contracts to sign with NFL teams. The AAF filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 17, 2019, with the league's sole season left incomplete.
History.
Charlie Ebersol, son of former NBC executive and XFL co-founder Dick Ebersol, was inspired to create the AAF in late 2016 after producing the documentary "This Was the XFL" for ESPN Films' "30 for 30" series; upon researching and examining the history of the XFL, he came to the conclusion that the concept was viable but that the finished product was both poorly executed and, from an on-field standpoint, bad football. He began developing the AAF in February 2017, about the same time that word had come out about XFL co-founder Vince McMahon possibly reviving the old XFL brand (which McMahon would indeed do in 2020). Exhibits in a lawsuit filed by Robert Vanech, who claimed to have co-founded the AAF, state that Ebersol had originally approached McMahon about relaunching the XFL but was unable to come to an agreement, as Ebersol wanted control of the XFL brand and was willing to pay $50 million for the trademark, which McMahon was unwilling to sell. In December 2018, Charlie Ebersol asked Vince McMahon about merging the AAF (which was two months away from starting) with the XFL. McMahon turned him down.
The league was formally organized on February 6, 2018 as an interlocked web of five Delaware limited liability companies: Legendary Field Exhibitions, AAF Players, AAF Properties, LFE 2, and We Are Realtime, LLC. Each in turn was controlled by Ebersol through his own entity as manager, Ebersol Sports Media Group, Inc., while minority investors held stakes in one or more of the LLC entities.
The AAF was announced on March 20, 2018. Ebersol sought to focus on creating a solid football product in the hopes that it would attract fans. He hired a team of experienced football players, coaches and executives to prepare the league for launch. The AAF was overseen by former NFL general manager Bill Polian, former Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, and executive J. K. McKay. Advisers also include former Steelers receiver Hines Ward, former New York Giants and Oakland Raiders defensive end Justin Tuck, retired referee and current Fox NFL rules analyst Mike Pereira, and Ebersol's father, Dick Ebersol.
Ebersol attended the first XFL game in Las Vegas in 2001, and remembered how disappointed his father was by the poor quality of play. To ensure professional-level football at launch, the AAF set out to hire coaches with professional football coaching and championship experience. On April 7, 2018, the first team, Orlando, was announced with its coach Steve Spurrier. By June 2018, the league had announced its eight inaugural teams and their cities.
On July 30, 2018, the Alliance announced the league had signed 100 players. In August 2018, the league held the Alliance Scouting Combine at three locations and four dates: August 4, 2018, in Los Angeles, California; August 18 in Houston, Texas; and August 25–26 in Atlanta, Georgia. By August 24, 2018, 205 players were signed. These dates provided an opportunity for players cut at the NFL roster deadline, and each player signed a non-guaranteed three-year contract worth a total of $250,000 ($70,000 in 2019; $80,000 in 2020; $100,000 in 2021), with performance-based and fan-interaction incentives allowing for players to earn more.
In July 2018, Starter, through G-III Sports, which manufactured NFL jerseys and apparel in the 1980s and 1990s, was named the official on-field apparel and game-day uniform supplier for the AAF, marking a return for the brand to professional football after an almost 20-year absence. On September 20, the league announced four eastern inaugural franchises' names and logos. The four western teams' logos and names were revealed five days later.
Inaugural season.
On October 16, 2018, the Alliance announced its schedule (indicating the day and location, but not the time, of each game) which had two games each on Saturday and on Sunday most weekends. Quarterback skills training camps were held at the Alamodome in San Antonio on November 12 through 14. On November 27, the league held a four-round "Protect or Pick" quarterback draft in the Esports Arena at Luxor Las Vegas and broadcast on CBS Sports Network.
The AAF began its inaugural, 10-week season on February 9, 2019. The first points in AAF regular season history were scored by kicker Younghoe Koo of the Atlanta Legends, who made a 38-yard field goal against the Orlando Apollos. The first touchdown came in the same game with Orlando quarterback Garrett Gilbert connecting with Jalin Marshall for a 16-yard score. The first shutout was recorded by the Birmingham Iron when they defeated the Memphis Express, 26–0, in Week 1. The first onside conversion (see Rules section, below) was attempted during Week 3, with Atlanta successfully completing a 48-yard pass against Birmingham. The first safety was registered by Atlanta against the Arizona Hotshots in Week 4. The first overtime game occurred in Week 7, with Memphis defeating Birmingham.
A four-team playoff was to be capped with the league's championship game, initially scheduled to be held at Sam Boyd Stadium near Las Vegas. After Dundon took over league operations, he moved the game to the Ford Center at the Star in Frisco, Texas.
Cessation of operations.
On April 2, 2019, the AAF suspended all football operations, on orders from AAF chairman Tom Dundon. League co-founder Bill Polian stated:
Players found out about the suspension through the Internet before their coaches confirmed the news. Players were evicted from the hotels where their teams were being housed—with some being personally charged for unpaid hotel bills—and required to pay their own way home; they also lost their health insurance and were forced to cover their own medical bills from injuries sustained during play. League employees were notified via an April 2 letter from the AAF board, which did not give a reason for ending the season, that their jobs were terminated as of April 3 with no severance. Ebersol and Dundon refused public comment; Ebersol would eventually speak out on April 17, stating that he had been advised not to speak by his attorneys. He insisted that the money he raised was there and had been vetted up until immediately before the season, claimed that reports of players being saddled with hotel and medical bills were either fake news or fraudulent charges, and could not ensure that all those owed money would be paid.
On April 4, the AAF announced through their official Twitter account that players were eligible to leave their contracts to sign with NFL teams. The contracts that players had originally signed included a stipulation that they could leave to sign with NFL teams at the conclusion of an AAF season. The league did not issue any public statement until April 6, when the AAF.com website was updated with a statement, which read in part:
At the time its football operations were suspended, the AAF had played eight weeks out of a scheduled ten-week regular season.
Bankruptcy liquidation.
On April 17, Ebersol Sports Media Group, Inc. and the five AAF operating entities filed for joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation) in Texas’ Eastern District. In the filing, the league claimed assets of $11.3 million, liabilities of $48.3 million, and approximately $536,000 in cash. The AAF counted its player contracts among its assets in the bankruptcy filing, blocking players from joining the Canadian Football League. This block was lifted a day after the bankruptcy filing.
The league's uniforms and equipment were stored in a lot in San Antonio, Texas and eventually auctioned off in July 2019. Former Arena Football League commissioner Jerry Kurz made the winning bid at $455,000, beating out bids from (among others) the revived XFL. Subsequently, the perpetually postponed Major League Football claimed it had entered into an agreement to purchase the equipment for $400,000.
Rules.
Ebersol deliberately avoided making radical changes to the rules of the game so as to make it recognizable to the U.S. public. He stated that he used the average length of a feature film, slightly over two hours, as the basis for a typical fan's attention span.
Business.
The Alliance operated as a single entity, with all teams owned and operated by the league, under the name Legendary Field Exhibitions LLC. Some of the investors in the AAF included Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, The Chernin Group (which owns Barstool Sports), Jared Allen, Slow Ventures, Adrian Fenty, Charles King's M Ventures, and Keith Rabois. Long-term plans were for the AAF to sell franchises to individual owners.
MGM Resorts International made an investment in the AAF tech platform, and entered a three-year sponsorship agreement to become the league's official sports betting sponsor and exclusive gaming partner. The deal marked the first time any sports organization had sold exclusive in-game betting rights to a sportsbook. Scott Butera, MGM's director of interactive gaming (the division that signed an agreement with the AAF), was formerly the commissioner of the Arena Football League before his 2018 ouster. Under the terms of the agreement, MGM Resorts International owned all rights to the tech platform in the event the league ceases operations, preventing an investor from buying the league solely for access to the technology. Gambling functions were never implemented on the league's app, and many planned features for the app never materialized due to technical glitches and impracticality.
The league also had player bonuses and scholarships, with player bonuses based on performance and fan interaction, players were to earn a year's scholarship in post-secondary education for each season of play. Players got three-year, non-guaranteed contracts worth $250,000 plus health insurance with an escape clause to go to the NFL. The three-year contract was believed to be purposely targeting the XFL to prevent second-tier professional players from signing with the XFL if they played in the AAF in 2019. XFL commissioner Oliver Luck stated that he did not believe that such a clause would hold up in court after the AAF collapsed, and that the XFL would be willing to sign AAF players. The league also has an incentive system that pays members of a team's offensive and defensive units for statistical achievements and also pays players to perform community service; the exact details of this incentive system were not yet finalized at the start of the 2019 season. Players are assigned to each team by way of a centralized process that is largely a trade secret. The league showed willingness to offer more money to marquee players; Landry Jones noted that Ebersol had personally promised a salary of over $1,000,000 to Jones if he played for the San Antonio Commanders; when Jones pressed Ebersol on when he would be paid, Ebersol became evasive, leading Jones to reject the offer. Matt McGloin likewise turned down the AAF, both because of his skepticism over the league and the birth of his child. For the fans, in addition to a fantasy league built into mobile broadcasts, there were low ticket prices (each team have a $35/game sideline seat option) and inexpensive food at games. When the league abruptly folded, the league left players to personally pay outstanding bills for their own hotels, as well as their transportation home and even their medical bills from injuries sustained during play.
The AAF coaching salaries varied by title, with $500,000 for head coaches, $200–250,000 for coordinators, and $75–150,000 for position coaches. Each AAF team employed between 11 and 13 total coaches, putting the total coaching staff expenditures at around $2 million per staff and $16 million for the entire league.
Dundon investment.
On February 18, 2019, the league announced that Tom Dundon, whose other holdings include the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL) and TopGolf, agreed to invest $250 million into the league. He was also named the new chairman of the AAF, and Dundon reportedly received a majority stake in the league in exchange for his investment. Dundon's investment was initially reported to be due to the league being in danger of not making payroll. It was later reported that the payroll issue was due to a glitch in the league's changing of payroll companies, and that Dundon's investment had already been planned. Dundon later backtracked on his previous claim of a $250 million investment, noting that he had not actually delivered a $250 million lump sum to the league. Dundon planned on incrementally investing in the league, using $250 million as a theoretical maximum based on if the league were to "aggressively expand," and reserved the right to pull out of the league at any time. At the time of the reported April 2 suspension, Dundon had invested an estimated $70 million into the AAF. He had drastically reduced unnecessary expenses and mostly abandoned the technology platform by the end of the league's operations in a desperate attempt to keep the league financially viable.
Ebersol had admitted prior to the start of the season that, on numerous occasions, the AAF had come dangerously close to folding before its first game due to various unstated complications. When asked whether some of the AAF's initial investors had dropped out, Ebersol declined to answer. After the league suspended operations, it was revealed that one of the league's major investors, former Minnesota Vikings minority owner Reggie Fowler, had indeed pulled his funding after the inaugural game, necessitating the abrupt sale to Dundon. It came out in late April that Fowler's funds had been frozen by the Department of Justice, after Fowler's indictment on charges of money laundering for cryptocurrency exchanges.
In early March 2019, it was revealed by Bill Polian that the AAF and National Football League were in informal discussions about a system where players under contract to NFL teams could be loaned to AAF teams. The idea would have been be for NFL teams to assign their third-string quarterback and other players from the bottom half of their roster and practice squads to the AAF to gain more playing time in a similar system to what used to be in place during the existence of NFL Europe. This would have in effect made the AAF an official developmental league of the NFL. Dundon sought a change in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement to protect AAF players who may get injured and miss NFL playing time by ensuring the players still earned a salary from the NFL during their recovery. In late March, Dundon stated that, in reference to the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) and its reluctance to cooperate out of concern for injuries, if they are "not going to give us young players, we can't be a development league". He added that the AAF was looking at its options, including discontinuing the league if the NFLPA wasn't willing to work with the league. Profootballtalk.com reported shortly thereafter, citing unnamed sources, that if Dundon's demands were not met, he was willing to end his investment before the season ended, possibly as soon as after Week 8, which would cut off the league's cash flow and force it to immediately fold with the playoffs and championship left unplayed. As Week 8 passed, Dundon reiterated his stance on April 1, stating he was still willing to pull his funding before the next week's game.
Ultimately the AAF lost an estimated $88 million overall, earning only $12 million in revenue against its $100 million expenses.
Legal matters.
In late February 2019, a lawsuit by a venture capitalist in Los Angeles became public, as the AAF issued a statement denying a claim by Robert Vanech that the league was his idea and that he had a handshake agreement with Charlie Ebersol; Vanech is seeking financial damages and 50 percent ownership of the league.
Also in late February, the league revealed that it had been unable to secure a league-wide worker's compensation insurance policy prior to the start of the season, forcing the Orlando Apollos to move its practice operations to Kingsland, Georgia, and commute to Orlando for games, as Florida does not consider professional athletes to be eligible for worker's compensation.
In April 2019, after the league suspended football operations, two players—punter Colton Schmidt of the Birmingham Iron and linebacker Reggie Northrup of the Orlando Apollos—filed a class action lawsuit in California, claiming that they were misled about the financial viability of the league and that the league entered contracts with players in bad faith.
Also in April, two former front-office league employees filed a class action lawsuit in California, claiming that the league violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, which requires large companies to give at least a 60-day advanced notice before large layoffs.
Reggie Fowler was arrested April 30, 2019, on charges related to operating a massive cryptocurrency scam in 2018, the funds for which were used to fund his AAF investments.
Key people.

Media.
As part of its formation, the AAF announced broadcast deals with CBS Sports; opening day (consisting of two regionally-televised games) was scheduled for CBS, as well as a playoff semifinal and the championship game. The telecasts made extensive use of on-field microphones (with head coaches and quarterbacks also miked), and Skycams (with two deployed for each game, with one along the sideline, as opposed to having more than one high camera). Half of the games broadcast each week were produced off-site from Sneaky Big Studios in Scottsdale, Arizona: graphics (which were provided by CBS), Skycam operations, and commentary were performed remotely from the Scottsdale site, as well as studio coverage for all games (via a virtual studio). Ebersol did not disclose whether or not the league was buying the airtime or receiving the airtime for free as part of a partnership agreement. After the season ended, it was confirmed that the AAF had resorted to buying airtime and was unlikely to be able to extract a rights fee from any of its partners for its foreseeable future, a factor in Dundon's decision to withdraw his investment. CBS broadcast an ad for the league during its coverage of Super Bowl LIII.
CBS Sports Network aired one game per week, and was scheduled to air one of the playoff games. In addition to local stations, TNT was announced as broadcasting two games per season (one regular season and a playoff game which later was expanded to include three regular season games) while NFL Network aired two weekly games. The league's mobile app offered live streaming of all games except those broadcast on CBS Sports Network, billed as "AAF Raw" as most of the AAF live streams contain no announcers or on-screen graphics, while Turner's B/R Live streamed one game a week. Integrated fantasy games were available through the AAF site and app as well.
CBSSN's game of the week was called by Ben Holden, Adam Archuleta, and John Schriffen. NFL Network's broadcast team for week one consisted of Dan Hellie on play-by-play and Marvin Lewis on color commentary. TNT's broadcast team consisted of Brian Anderson on play-by-play, Lewis on color commentary, and Maurice Jones-Drew as sideline reporter. The league did not use set announcer pairings, rotating numerous hosts (several of them from CBS's NFL and college football crews) on both play-by-play and color commentary, depending on availability.
Sirius XM Radio, a satellite radio service, carried a select Game of the Week. Additionally, teams made broadcast deals with local radio affiliates.
Reception.
Critics.
The AAF received mixed to positive reviews opening night. Profootballtalk.com, in a mostly positive review, praised the league's television product and choice of markets that would embrace the league, singling out the live look-ins at the replay booth during coach's challenges as an innovation that could transfer to the NFL's television broadcasts. The on-field level of play was somewhat less well-received, being compared to NFL preseason levels, with numerous offensive miscues. SB Nation had a similar assessment, criticizing the game play as "much worse than... most of major college football," while at the same time noting that the league's innovations were largely successful in making games more interesting. In an admittedly incomplete review, Peter King stated that although he would not yet draw any "major conclusions" about the league, he liked some of the rule changes but feared the overtime process would be a gimmick.
Viewership.
Overnight Nielsen Ratings stated that the league-opening regionally televised games on CBS were the highest rated telecast of the night in the key demographic, drawing more viewers than an NBA game on ABC in the same time slot. In overall viewers, both the AAF and NBA lost to a rerun of "" on NBC. The NFL Network telecast that week secured 640,000 viewers. With these comparatively strong initial viewership statistics, the Week 2 ratings were highly anticipated in the interest of developing trended data. In Week 2, the afternoon and evening games on Saturday, February 16, reportedly attracted 1,018,000 and 425,000 viewers, respectively, in addition to the Sunday evening game on February 17 drawing 424,000 viewers. Week 3's NFL Network games drew 491,000 and 515,000 viewers, benefiting in part due to a counterprogramming effort against the 91st Academy Awards. Week 4's ratings were largely consistent with those of week 2, with the two NFL Network games that week securing ratings of 404,000 and 450,000 viewers, comparable to college basketball and NHL telecasts on the other sports networks. The disparity between the afternoon and evening games is consistent due to increased competition during primetime hours and the higher market penetration of CBS and TNT compared to NFL Network and CBS Sports Network, the latter of which does not register a rating in the Nielsens.
In March 2019, building upon these ratings successes, both CBS and TNT added games to their packages; Turner Sports shifted two additional Saturday afternoon games from B/R Live to TNT (with B/R Live streaming a Skycam-only feed of the games as a companion), while CBS announced that it would shift two games from CBS Sports Network to broadcast television, including a regular season game on April 6, 2019 (in the afternoon prior to CBS's broadcast of the 2019 NCAA Final Four), and one of the conference championship games. However, due to the suspension of football operations, these games were left unplayed.

Thomas Dee

Thomas S. Dee is an American economist and the Barnett Family Professor of Education at Stanford University, where he also directs the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities.
Biography.
Thomas Dee earned a B.A. in economics with a focus on public policy from Swarthmore College in 1990, followed by an M.A. and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Maryland in 1994 and 1997. After his graduation, Dee worked as an assistant professor of economics at the Georgia Institute of Technology (1997–99) and later also at Swarthmore College (1999–2005). There, he was promoted in 2005 to the position of associate professor and given the direction of the college's public policy programme. In 2010, Dee moved to the University of Virginia as research professor of education and professor of public policy and economics (2010–12), before further moving to Stanford University as professor of education in 2012. From 2015 to 2018, Dee directed the Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis (CEPA) and served as Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Additionally, Dee is affiliated with a number of institutions, including the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), CESifo, the Danish National Center for Social Research, the American Enterprise Institute, and the China Center for Human Capital and Labor Market Research at Central University of Finance and Economics. Furthermore, he has been affiliated with the Association for Education Finance and Policy and the Institute of Education Sciences. In terms of editorial duties, Dee sits on the editorial boards of the "Journal of Policy Analysis and Management" and "Educational Researcher" and has sat on the board of "Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis" in the past.
Research.
Thomas Dee's current research interests mostly revolve around education, including the economics of education, the analysis and implementation of educational policy, school finance, school reform, and high-stakes testing. Earlier research has also focused on youth health, e.g. teenage traffic accidents and youth health behaviors such as smoking and drinking. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Thomas Dee belongs to the top 3% of economists as ranked by their research.
Research on education.
Throughout his academic career, Dee has studied many topics related to education and education policy, e.g. competition between private and public schools, returns to education, and teacher incentives. Analysing the relationship between public school quality and the effect of competition from private schools, Dee finds that competition from the latter has a significant positive impact on the graduation rates of neighbouring public high schools. Investigating the existence of returns to education in the form of civic engagement and attitudes, Dee argues that educational attainment strongly increases voter participation, support for freedom of speech and newspaper readership (a measure of civic knowledge). With regard to the effectiveness of teacher incentives, Dee finds mixed evidence. In his evaluation of Tennessee's Career Ladder Evaluation System, which rewarded teachers who increased student achievement, together with Benjamin J. Keys, he finds that the test scores in mathematics of students assigned to career-ladder teachers were 3 percentile points higher than otherwise, but that such an assignment had no significant impact on reading scores. By contrast, his evaluation of IMPACT, the high-powered teacher-evaluation system introduced by Michelle Rhee in Washington D.C., conducted with James Wyckoff finds that dismissal threats increased the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers and improved the performance of remaining teachers, while financial incentives were effective in further improving the performance of high-performing teachers. Additionally, Dee has pioneered research on the impact of demographic similarity between students and teachers as well as on the impact of No Child Left Behind, the flagship education programme of George W. Bush's administration.
The impact of demographic similarity between teachers and students.
Analysing the impact on students' school achievement of being taught by a teacher of the same ethnic group in Tennessee, Dee finds that assignment of students to a teacher of their own ethnicity significantly increased both black and white students' achievements in mathematics and reading. Vice versa, Dee has also studied how demographic similarity between students and teachers influences teachers' subjective evaluations of student behavior and performance and found students' racial, ethnic and gender characteristics to substantially colour teachers' perceptions of student performance. However, the former two effects mainly appear in conjunction with students coming from poor family backgrounds or living in the South, which provides a strong argument for the recruitment of teachers from underrepresented minorities. This research is complemented by Dee's study of the impact of being taught by a teacher of the same gender, which he finds to significantly improve the achievements of both male and female students as well as teachers' perceptions of student performance and engagement.
The impact of No Child Left Behind.
Together with Brian Jacob, Thomas Dee has extensively researched the impact of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) - and its emphasis on test-based school accountability - on students, teachers, and schools. In particular, Dee and Jacob find that NCLB improved the math achievements of younger students, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, but failed to do so with regard to reading, raised school district expenditure, in particular on teacher compensation, and improved the quality of teachers, and resulted in a shift of teaching time towards math and reading as tested subjects.
Research on youth health and youth behaviour.
The other main area besides education on which Dee has conducted research is youth health, e.g. teenage smoking and drinking, sexual activity, and traffic accidents. Analysing how teen drinking and youth traffic fatalities respond to beer taxes, Dee finds that - while results vary substantially between U.S. states - beer taxes are generally ineffective in reducing teen drinking and associated traffic fatalities. In another study on teen drinking, Dee finds teen drinking and smoking to be complementary behaviours, with the increase in minimum legal drinking ages (MLDA) from 18 to 21 having reduced the numbers of teen smokers by 3-5% and higher cigarette taxes having lowered the prevalence of teen drinking. However, while teens facing a lower MLDA were substantially more likely to drink, the raise in the MLDA had no significant effect on educational attainment. Further research on the impact of macroeconomic conditions on alcohol abuse by Dee finds binge drinking to be strongly countercyclical, even among those who remain employed during the crisis. Finally, Dee, David Grabowski and Michael Morrisey investigated the impact of the introduction of graduated driver licensing (GDL) on teen traffic fatalities and find that GDL regulations reduced fatalities among 15- to 17-year-olds by at least 5.6% over 1992–2002 and didn't increase fatality risks for older teens once they didn't face GDL restrictions anymore.

In 2001, Argenziano was involved in a notable incident in which she delivered 25 lbs of gift-wrapped cow manure to Jodi Chase, a lobbyist for Associated Industries of Florida. AIF represents nursing home providers in Florida and was supporting SB1202, a nursing home reform bill which sought to limit damages in cases where a death did not occur or injuries were not deemed serious. Argenziano was one of the only state senators opposing the bill. Chase apparently entered Argenziano's office uninvited to watch a floor debate around the bill, angering the legislator. The manure was later delivered to chase at a lobbyist area in the Florida State Capitol Building, drawing a rebuke from the AIF and then House Speaker Tom Feeney, but gaining Argenziano many signatures from colleagues in a petition of support.

Handicapper (horse)

Handicapper (1898 – after 1918) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He showed some promising form as a juvenile in 1900 when he finished fourth in the July Stakes and then won the Richmond Stakes. After running poorly on his thee-year-old debut he recorded a major upset when he won the 2000 Guineas at odds of 33/1. Handicapper raced until the age of five but never won another race of any significance.
Background.
Handicapper was a brown horse bred in England by D Fraser. As a yearling he was bought for 380 guineas by Ernest Cassel who sent him into training with his private trainer Fred Day at Lowther House in Newmarket, Suffolk.
He was sired by Matchmaker, whose wins included the King Edward VII Stakes and the Princess of Wales's Stakes. His biggest impact as a breedings stallion was as the damsire of Son-in-Law. Handicapper's dam Agnes Osborne was a daughter of Wild Aggie, a broodmare whose other descendants have included Sagace, Slip Anchor and Buena Vista.
Racing career.
1900: two-year-old season.
Handicapper made his first appearance at Royal Ascot in June when he finished unplaced behind Bay Melton in the New Stakes. A month later at Newmarket Racecourse he ran fourth in the July Stakes, a race in which Doricles and Veles dead-heated for first place. Despite his unremarkable form he started 13/8 favourite for the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Ridden by the American jockey Lester Reiff he won from Osboch, with St Monans in third. He ended his year in the Moulton Stakes at Newmarket in October when he was beaten a neck into second by the filly Aida.
1901: three-year-old season.
Handicapper began his second season at Newmarket in April when he ran unplaced behind the four-year-old Petridge in a minor handicap race. On 1 May 1901 Handicapper started a 33/1 outsider for the 93rd running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. Veles started favourite ahead of Doricles, Orchid (Champagne Stakes) and Lord Bobs (Dewhurst Stakes) in a field of seventeen. Ridden by Bill Halsey he took the lead at half way, went clear of his rivals, and "sailed past the post, the easiest of winners" two lengths clear of Doricles with Osboch a neck away in third place. The Jockey Club held an inquiry into the colt's dramatic improvement but were satisfied by Fred Day's explanation.
As a result of his win in the Guineas, Handicapper was strongly fancied for the Epsom Derby a month later but his odds drifted on the day of the race and he was not among the first ten finishers in a race won by Volodyovski. At Royal Ascot later in June Handicapper finished unplaced behind the Duke of Devonshire's Lauzun in the St James's Palace Stakes. His poor form led to him being described as "one of the worst horses that have attained classic honours".
Later career.
Handicapper remained in training for at least two more years but failed to win any further major races. At the age of five in 1903 he finished third in the Royal Hunt Cup. In the Liverpool Cup he finished third to the six-year-old Captain Kettle, to whom he was conceding 23 pounds in weight.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Handicapper an "poor" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud career.
Handicapper was exported to Belgium in 1904, where is progeny earned 700,000 francs. Exported to Germany in 1913, Handicapper was standing in Reuthen, Germany in 1916 for a fee of 500 marks.

Inez Nathaniel-Walker

Inez Nathaniel-Walker (née Stedman) (1911-1990) was a self-taught African-American folk artist.
Biography.
Born into poverty in Sumter, South Carolina, Inez was orphaned at an early age, and married at 12 or 13. She moved to Philadelphia during the Great Migration to escape the harsh reality of intense farm work. In 1949, she moved to Port Byron, New York, where she worked in an apple processing plant. She was convicted of criminally negligent homicide after killing a man who abused her and imprisoned in Bedford Hills Correctional Prison from 1971 to 1973. After her prison sentence, she moved back to Port Byron. It was during her incarceration that she began to draw on the back of any paper she found to distance herself from the inmates who she called the "bad girls." She drew prolifically, filling dozens of notebooks in a few months until her release.
Career.
While incarcerated, Nathaniel-Walker's work attracted the attention of Elizabeth Bayley, one of Inez' prison teachers, who provided her with drawing paper, notebooks, and pencils. Mrs. Bayley also showed the drawings to a local folk art dealer, who later received the artist's sketch books.
Nathaniel-Walker's drawings are almost exclusively portraits of women. The works, executed in color pen, pencil, and ink, are characterized by a great profusion of embellished detail. The faces are shown in strict frontal or profile view with exaggerated eyes. The figures often wear clothes that were part of Inez's wardrobe. Of her process she said, "I don't look at nothing to draw by. I can't look at nobody and draw. I just draw by my own mission. I just sit down and start drawing."
Her work has been shown at the Akron Art Institute, the Corcoran Gallery, and in Brussels. Several of her drawings were also featured in the landmark exhibition, "Black Folk Art in America: 1930-1980." Her work is currently held in several prominent museum collections including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the American Folk Art Museum, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, and the High Museum.

Alessandro Berri

"Content in this edit is translated from the existing Italian Wikipedia article at ; see its history for attribution."
Alessandro Berri (Castelnuovo Scrivia, end XV century - Castelnuovo Scrivia, 2nd half XVI century) was an Italian painter who lived in Piedmont around the 1500s.
Life.
There is no clear information about his dates of birth and death, because most of sources about him are dating back to the 1800s.
However, these sources tell that his place of birth was Castelnuovo Scrivia (a town in the province of Alessandria) and that he was the nephew of Vincenzo Bandello (uncle of the novelist Matteo Bandello) the prior of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan during the period when Leonardo painted "The Last Supper".
According to the 19-century historian Goffredo Casalis, thanks to the intercession of Vincenzo Bandello, Leonardo became the tutor of Alessandro Berri: "..(Leonardo)…spent quite a long time in Castelnuovo, where [Alessandro Berri] was introduced [to Leonardo] through Matteo Bandello and his uncle Vincenzo… (Leonardo) on his hosts request accepted to train Alessandro Berri in the art of painting…".
These sources also tell that Alessandro Berri became a "distinguished pupil" of his great Maestro.
There are no further sources of information that may give exact data about the artistic and painterly development of Alessandro Berri.
From research conducted recently, Alessandro Berri was married to Gabriella Signorio, lived in Castelnuovo Scrivia in the district of "de Molinis" and certainly had 6 children even if it is not to be excluded that he had others.
Works.
His most known work of art is a copy of the "" which can be admired above the altar of the Corpus Domini Chapel of Saints Peter and Paul church in Castelnuovo Scrivia.
The artwork (260x265cm) is painted on a table made of five pieces of poplar wood commissioned by the ""Company of the Holy Sacrament" of Castelnuovo Scrivia, of which Alessandro Berri was a member brother.
He considerably lowered its cost both for the love for his Company and "for the good feeling he had to leave this important memory of his virtue to his Country in such an important place…"".
The paint itself can be seen as a copy of "The Last Supper" of Leonardo, but with the characters placed in a specular manner in spite of the original.Other known works are:
Credited to Alessandro Berri is also where are illustrated some Stories of the Passion. This artwork, sawed in the centre to insert a tabernacle, was re-discovered during the 1986 restoration works of "The Last Supper" hidden by the lower wooden frame of the altar.

Alpha Male Tea Party

Alpha Male Tea Party are a British math rock band from Liverpool, England, formed in September 2009. The band currently consists of Tom Peters (vocals, guitar), Ben Griffiths (bass, vocals) and Greg Chapman (drums).
History.
Alpha Male Tea Party began as an "escape from the drudgery of full time employment" for Tom Peters, who began putting together demos for math rock songs on the music program Logic and advertised for band members on Gumtree. The earliest carnation of the band was initially called Safe In A Shell. Many singers were auditioned, but none were deemed a fit for the band. Debut album 'AMTP' and early shows featured Peters along with bassist Daniel Leadbetter and drummer Pedro Ribeiro. Greg Chapman was recruited to play drums in January 2012, the day after his last project had disintegrated. From the recording of 'Droids' onwards; the final lineup consisted of Peters, Chapman, and bassist Ben Griffiths, whom Peters had never seen play bass but was recruited on the basis of being "a funny man".
Their third full-length album "Health" was released in June 2017 through Big Scary Monsters, and was produced by Tom Peters and Dan Wild-Beesley of the former Manchester band Cleft, a close friend of the band. Wild-Beesley worked through a period of ill health while producing the record, which influenced its "darker" sound.
"Infinity Stare" was recorded during the COVID-19 lockdown of May-June 2020 at Trapdoor Studios, a recording facility in Liverpool owned by Tom Peters. Released via Big Scary Monsters one day after its announcement in December 2020, after the death of Wild-Beesley. The grief of his passing strongly influenced the album, and led to a creative block for the band until the COVID-19 pandemic allowed them to focus more strongly on their work.
Alpha Male Tea Party have played at ArcTanGent Festival in Bristol in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018. But in 2019 the band played a set as 'The Beft - A Tribute to Dan Wild-Beesley´ featuring Mike Vennart formerly of Oceansize and John Simm, former drummer of Cleft. The set consisted of a 15min Cleft medley and an original piece written for the occasion featuring a guitar orchestra consisting of 20 guitarists. They were scheduled to play at the 2020 festival before it was cancelled, and were on the line up for 2021, which was rolled over into the 2022 edition after it was cancelled.

Chinko

Chinko, also known as Chinko Nature Reserve and the Chinko Project Area, is a protected area in the Central African Republic. The nonprofit conservation organization African Parks began managing Chinko in partnership with the government of the Central African Republic in December 2014.
Description and terrain.
Chinko is a 5.9 million hectare (or nearly 7,000 square miles) protected area in the southeastern part of the Central African Republic, managed by the nonprofit conservation organization African Parks as part of a fifty-year public–private partnership with the Ministry of Water, Forest, Hunting and Fishing. African Parks began managing Chinko in December 2014, becoming the eighth park to be included in the organization's management portfolio. David Simpson, who co-founded the project, serves as the park's manager.
Chinko is located on a volcanic plateau, above sea level. Rain and other freshwater sources are plentiful, and Precambrian bedrock erosion has created a layer of alluvial soil, allowing abundant and diverse wildlife to disperse throughout the region. The park has been described having uncommon geology, plentiful water, and a role as a "diversifying agent".
Flora and fauna.
Chinko has of "uninhabited Medio-Sudanian and Sudano Guinean" wooded savannah with some Congolese rainforest. These diverse ecosystems form an ecotone within the Chinko River basin and support a variety of wildlife, including several primate species, African forest elephants, 23 even-toed ungulate species, more than 20 types of carnivores, 5 anteater mammals, and approximately 500 bird species. Carnivores include the African wild dog, leopard, lion, and mongoose. Other species include: African buffalo, bongo, chimpanzee, monkey, crocodile, Eastern giant eland, giant forest hog, hartebeest (including Lelwel hartebeest), red forest duiker, warthog, waterbuck, and yellow-backed duiker.
The reserve is home to dozens of endangered species, and the following bird species: black-bellied bustards, buzzards, guineafowl, hoopoes, hornbills, kingfishers, secretarybirds, stone partridge, and sunbirds. Chinko, being an extensive block of pristine habitat, can provide the genetic diversity to recolonize the surrounding regions when populations there dwindle or become locally extinct.
History.
Chinko previously served as a hunting reserve and was home to thousands of buffalo, elephant, and lion. The area saw significant decreases in wildlife populations during the 1980s–2000s because of cattle grazing, the ivory trade, and poaching. In 2002, it was reported that as much as 95 percent of wildlife in the Chinko region was lost.
Erik Mararv and his family acquired a hunting concession in 2005 and launched a safari operation called Central African Wildlife Adventures in 2006. During the safari's six years of operating, the Mararv family built two airstrips, guest rooms, and hundreds of miles of roads, imported machinery and trucks, and trained staff. David Simpson started working as a pilot for the safari company in 2010, and was asked by Mararv to return as general manager the following year. Foreign pastoralists, known as the Wodaabe (or Mbororo), started herding in more remote parts of the Central African Republic, including Chinko and surrounding areas, around 2012. The additional cattle grazing, overgrazing, poaching, and wildfires contributed to deforestation, desertification, and erosion. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service contributed nearly $100,000 in 2013 to reduce poaching by training rangers and reaching out to local communities to increase awareness of conservation efforts. Simpson co-created the Chinko Project to protect the area's habitat and wildlife, and began managing the park when African Parks took over operations in 2014. Thierry Aebischer, Raffael Hickisch, and Erik Mararv have also been credited as partners of the project.
Chinko had fifty park rangers in February 2016. In mid 2016, Simpson was reportedly managing 400 staff members and a $2.5 million budget, and Chinko was "the only major tax-generating entity in the entire eastern half of the Central African Republic, and one of the largest employers and importers of foreign goods in the country". Chinko staff collected more than 700,000 wildlife sightings from motion-activated cameras by mid 2016, and used a small aircraft to identify and track animals and park intruders. Fondation Segré partnered with African Parks in 2016 to hire and train rangers, construct operations centers, improve communications technology, purchase equipment, and enhance data management.
In January 2017, a helicopter chartered by African Parks crashed, killing the park's head of law enforcement, his deputy, and the pilot.

Chris Gladwin (engineer)

Chris Gladwin is an American inventor, computer engineer and technology entrepreneur, who has founded or co-founded a series of tech related companies including MusicNow, Cleversafe and Ocient.
Biography.
Chris Gladwin was brought up to a middle-class family of medical professionals in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio. Gladwin attended Upper Arlington High School in Columbus, Ohio and received a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986.
Entrepreneurship.
Gladwin started his career as emerging technologies manager at Martin Marietta, a defense contractor which in 1995 merged with Lockheed Corporation. He later created the first "workgroup storage server" while working for Zenith Data Systems. In June 1996, Gladwin founded "Cruise Technologies", a developer and maker of wireless tablet computers. The company was later acquired by NEC Corporation of America. "MusicNow", (formerly FullAudio), founded in 1999, was among the first internet music firms to launch a music subscription business with both composition and recording licenses from major music labels including EMI, Sony/BMG, Universal Music Group, and the Warner Music Group. The company reached 100,000 customers before being sold to Circuit City. Details of the sale were not disclosed.
In 2016, Gladwin and Jeremie Bacon co-founded The Forge: Lemont Quarries, a 300-acre outdoor adventure park located 22 miles from Chicago. A number of sources describe the park as "the largest in North America with hundreds of possible routes". The park was set to open May 25, 2020 but the plans were postponed to a later date due to the coronavirus quarantine restrictions.
Cleversafe.
Gladwin formed his next technology startup company, Chicago-based, Cleversafe, an object storage software and systems developer, which he founded in 2004 and served as CEO and President up through the company's sale in 2015. The company was originally based in IIT's technology incubator. The initial funding was provided by OCA Ventures. In 2011, it was also supported by In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm related to the Central Intelligence Agency
In November 2015, Cleversafe was acquired by IBM for $1.3 billion and became a part of its IBM Cloud Object Storage division. The offering was originally introduced by Cleversafe. Cleversafe sold an object storage system, which it called the Dispersed Storage Network or dsNet. As Jim Comfort, a general manager of IBM Cloud, admitted: "...the object storage offered by Cleversafe represented a gap in IBM's portfolio." IBM has since rebranded the company's products as IBM Cloud Object Storage.
Ocient.
Ocient was co-founded in 2016 by Chris Gladwin, George Kondiles and Joe Jablonski, who was on Cleversafe's technical advisory board. In June 2020, Ocient raised additional $15 million with the help of OCA Ventures and In-Q-Tel.
Patents and awards.
He is the inventor of more than 200 issued patents. He has also been the recipient of at least 16 industry awards for his work including the 2017 Peter Lisagor Award for best podcast single episode, "Cleversafe and the whale (How to survive being right)".
Philanthropy.
In 2015, Gladwin donated $7.6 million to Illinois Institute of Technology with the main purpose to develop computer science program in Chicago. He also sits on the board of trustees of the institution. He serves as co-chair of P33, a technology nonprofit founded to bolster Chicago's high-tech industry and is on the board of a number of other organizations including SmartBet Charities and the Chicago Innovation Awards. In 2020, Gladwin helped to create and accomplish the concept for launching Illinois Tech College of Computing for further development of Chicago's tech industry. The college launched in March 2020 with classes beginning in June 2020

Carl Westmoreland

Carl B. Westmoreland is an American community organizer, preservationist, and senior historian at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. In 1967, he was one of the founding members of the Mount Auburn Good Housing Foundation, with money provided by private donations. The purpose of the Mount Auburn Good Housing Foundation was partly in response to the "rampant crime, decrepit housing owned by absentee landlords, and no influence within City Hall" and one of the best ways to improve these circumstances was to "help more young people by helping them find a decent place to live and getting them jobs."
In addition to serving African American communities throughout Cincinnati, he would also go on to become the "first African American to serve on the National Trust for Historic Preservation." Westmoreland is currently Senior Historian and a founding staff person of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati. His work there has included researching the history of the Internal Slave Trade and the historic role that class, gender, race and slavery have played on contemporary political, social and economic issues. He attempts to use historic research that often explores the unpleasant as a positive tool that can bring resolution to diverse communities. In addition to the research generated by the demand of his speeches, he was the curator of the Freedom Center's largest exhibit, a slave pen. Slave pens were used as 1 million enslaved African in America were shipped from coastal states to Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. The Pen is one of the few still in existence. Westmoreland also advises the senior staff on national and international freedom issues. In addition to having overseen millions of dollars in community restoration projects, Westmoreland has taught as an Adjunct Professor at the University of Cincinnati's Graduate School of Community Planning. traveled, studied, and lectured in Poland, Italy, Germany, China and Mexico. He has lectured to a wide audience from neighborhood groups, churches, leader of U. S. and Mexican governments and to executives of major corporations in America. Westmoreland has served as an editorial writer for a major newspaper, reviewed books for major publishers, and lectured at major American universities. A major focus of his civic work has been bringing attention to the leaders of all races the cross-cultural importance of the physical preservation of the African American Church. Westmoreland served as the keynote speaker at the 36th bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama and successfully lobbied the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the mid-1990s to declare Black Churches an Endangered American Historic Resource. He has also assisted Black churches in historic buildings to secure listings on the National Register of Historic Places such as the Union Baptist Cemetery in Cincinnati, and the Saint James African Methodist Episcopal Church and Cemetery in Havre De Grace, Maryland."
Education.
After growing up in Lincoln Heights, Ohio and attending Wyoming High School, Westmoreland briefly attended Miami University, before enrolling at Knoxville College, where he began his involvement in community activism. He earned a master's degree in urban sociology.

PhagesDB

The Actinobacteriophage database, more commonly known as PhagesDB, is a database-backed website that gathers and shares information related to the discovery, characterization and genomics of viruses that prefer to infect Actinobacterial hosts. It is a bioinformatics tool that is used worldwide to compare multiple phages and their genomic annotations. Up to recent dates, there have been more than 8,000 bacteriophages, including over 1,600 with already sequenced genomes, have been entered into the database. It is an addition to the wide range of priorly existing bioinformatic tools, like NCBI. It provides results of already sequenced phage genomes and aims to allow access to drafted phage genomes to provide a larger spectrum of information.
Background.
PhagesDB provides the Actinobacteriophage research community with an outlet to post their findings and share it with the members of their community who can then further analyze the data and use it to annotate newly discovered phage genomes through comparison. It was designed to keep up with the speed of discovery so new genes can be uploaded in real time. It is supposed to help avoid the "time-lag between sequencing and availability of annotated genomes in GenBank. It links students from all over the world who are performing authentic research via the SEA-PHAGES program so they can share their results with the rest of the research community." There are more than 6400 registered PhagesDB users with xxx.edu email addresses, reflecting usage by student researchers.
In 1993, the sequencing of L5 led to the start of the first decade of Actinobacteriophage genomics, and concluded in the publication of an analysis that compared 14 different mycobacteriophage genomes in 2003. Using local spreadsheets and GenBank, it was possible to manage the resulting data for approximately a year, provided that it was at the pace of approximately one genome every year. However, the following two developments made this approach indefensible. First of all, the creation of the Phage Hunters Integrating Research and Education (PHIRE) program created a path for beginner high school and college scientists to purify, isolate, and characterize their own new phages, leading to a sharp increase in the amount of phage isolates that can be accessed for sequencing. Secondly, the revelation of Next-Generation Sequencing technologies caused a faster and cheaper sequencing of those genomes of phages. As a result the number of phage genomes sequenced in the next decade exponentially increased. The foundation of the Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) program in 2008 increased the pipeline more for isolation and sequencing of Actinobacteriophage, and coping with the data created by these programs brought a challenge.
PhagesDB was created to be a single, concentrated archive of phage information where anyone interested in or involved with phage study could access and enter data. A web-accessible database sample allowed the storage and retrieval of data in a methodical and pliable way, as well as giving easy access to anyone with an connection to internet. In April 2010, PhagesDB launched, and was initially only for Mycobacteriophages (phages of mycobacterial hosts). In 2015, it became the Actinobacteriophage Database to contain all phages infecting hosts in the Phylum Actinobacteria.
Design and Features.
The creation of PhagesDB was carried out using Django and was hosted on a WebFaction server. Django is a Python-based web-development framework, and it was chosen specifically for its high versatility, accessibility to non-professional programmers, clarity of documentation, and several other out-of-the-box features including a fully functional administrative site. It was important for it to have accessibility to non-professional programmers as that allows for a more diverse range of results. Rather than host PhagesDB locally, WebFaction was chosen for its easy integration with Django, its high-level data security and its low downtime. The database website opens up with a mostly green and black lobby page and on the top left, a search bar is present. Phage names can be, sequenced and/or draft, typed in the search bar and results immediately pop up.
PhagesDB has an individual phage page for every single phage out of the more than 8000 phages that have been entered into the database. These pages contain detailed information regarding the phages. This information includes discovery details (GPS coordinates, year found, isolation temperature, host bacterium, etc.), sequencing details (genome length, G + C content, type of genome termini, etc.), characterization details (morphotype, cluster/subcluster, gene list, etc.) and further useful files (fasta sequence file, plaque picture, restriction digest picture, micrograph, etc.). If applicable, there are links to the GenBank entry for the phage, as well as the paper it was published in. Along with all these, there is a separate GeneMark page for each phage which allows one to cross reference the position of genomes within the draft phages to ensure that there is indeed a genome present at a certain spot. PhagesDB can be used on its own but is found to be more accurate when used in collaboration with another bioinformatics website like NCBI Blast. The figure below indicates the different types and numbers of phages sequenced:
There are many different ways in PhagesDB where the user is able to view and contact with groups of phages. Phage lists can be generated and classified by host (genus, species, or strain), cluster, subcluster, institution, year found, genome length, G + C content and a few other criteria. The filter page lets for a combination of criteria to aim at a group of phages with particular characteristics. Each phage cluster and subcluster has its own page with a catalog of member phages. Along with this each cluster and subcluster has days present about itself as well, for example number of members in the clusters, their average genome sizes, and the hosts their members infect or prefer to infect. There is an interactive map that shows all phages/clusters that are sequenced with known GPS coordinates. This gives information about the geographical spread of phage locations of isolation. The compare page lets users view all plaque pictures, limitation digest pictures, or micrographs for a given phage group. PhagesDB has amino-acid level details about its phage genomes that are sequenced by integration with Phamerator
Access and Rights to Data.
PhagesDB data can be viewed by anyone freely and anyone can register for the site (through Google, Facebook, Twitter, or PhagesDB itself), giving the ability to add new phages that have been found, and modify the phage data while learning more about the characteristics of phages.
Additionally, the site gives multiple ways of bringing back the fundamental data. The download page of the data consists of links for downloading all sequences of phage genome, texts about each phage with a broad information, and photos with all plaque images, restriction digest gel pictures, or micrographs for any given cluster. Each Pham page provides a link to download the amino acid sequences of all members of that Pham for comparative proteomic motives.
An Application Programming Interface (API) was recently added to let users approach a lot of underlying data in a way more compatible for computers. The PhagesDB API receives appeals for all phages, the ones by host, by cluster or subcluster, sequenced, etc., and reverts json objects with the wanted information. PhagesDB keeps some unpublished data that is not present in any medium, including genome sequences that have been done recently. The PhagesDB ‘Terms of Use’ contains instructions on how and which data shall be used by third parties. For instance, users willing to take advantage of unpublished data for their private purposes need permission from the owners of data.

Cyclone Marcus

Severe Tropical Cyclone Marcus was a very powerful tropical cyclone that struck Australia's Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia in March 2018. It was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2017–18 Australian region cyclone season, as well as the strongest tropical cyclone in the Australian region basin since George in 2007. It was also considered the worst cyclone to hit Darwin since Tracy in 1974. It was also the strongest tropical cyclone since Tracy to hit Darwin, making landfall there as a Category 2 tropical cyclone. Marcus formed on March 14 from a tropical low situated over the northeast Timor Sea, which quickly moved southeast and strengthened into a tropical cyclone the next day.
Meteorological history.
On 15 March 2018, a tropical low formed in the western Arafura Sea. Drifting east-southeastwards north of the Tiwi Islands, the tropical low strengthened into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale early on 16 March, and was accordingly given the name "Marcus". In a generally favourable environment for intensification, Cyclone Marcus reached Category 2 status in the hours before it crossed the Northern Territory coastline, on 17 March. On 16 March, Marcus moved down towards the Australian coast, and rapidly intensified before making landfall in Darwin as a weak Category 2 tropical cyclone.
Marcus intensified markedly upon moving away from the coast. Soon, the storm started to rapidly intensify, and by 21 March, Marcus reached Category 5 tropical cyclone intensity. However, after doing so, the storm began to rapidly weaken due to a combination of an eyewall replacement cycle, stronger wind shear, and cooler waters. Marcus continued to rapidly weaken as it moved southward. The system soon transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on March 25, though Marcus' remnant would continue moving southeastward for another couple of days. On March 27, the extratropical remnant of Marcus dissipated off the southwest coast of Australia.
Preparation and impact.
Before the storm, on 15 March, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone warnings for Darwin, the Tiwi Islands, and parts of the northwest Top End. Major events and flights in and out of Darwin were cancelled. Approximately 26,000 homes were affected by electricity outages as a result of the destructive winds, even in areas as far south as Batchelor and Adelaide River. Thousands of trees were destroyed across the Greater Darwin region including many African mahoganies planted after Cyclone Tracy for their fast growing and expansive shade qualities.
Public schools and non-essential public service agencies were closed while the clean-up efforts continued and tree trunks removed from roads. Cyclone Marcus was the most destructive storm to hit Darwin since Cyclone Tracy caused devastation on Christmas Eve of 1974. The insurance loss were over A$85 million (US$65.6 million). In all, Marcus caused an estimated total of A$97.46 million (US$75 million) in damages.
The cleanup response was coordinated by the Northern Territory Emergency Services and included soldiers from the 5th Battalion and the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment of the Australian Army. The US Marine Rotational Force – Darwin (MRF-D) also contributed to the cleanup effort.
Retirement.
Due to the damage caused by the cyclone in Darwin and its subsequent intensification, the name "Marcus" was retired and was replaced with "Marco".

Phoebe Cole

Phoebe Cole Gordon (July 15, 1955 – January 14, 2017) was an American artist.
Early life.
Gordon was born in Eugene, Oregon on July 15, 1955. As a child, she was not allowed to sit and watch television without doing something her mother deemed "constructive," so she was provided drawing paper and colored pencils. From this, Gordon learned to doodle while she watched cartoons. She graduated from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Printmaking in 1981.
Career.
Following her completion of a BFA in Printmaking, Gordon produced multicolored linoleum cuts and sold them to galleries around the United States. Gordon's prints were exhibited widely during the 1980s and 1990s. Soon after, she moved on from printmaking to creating papier-mâché altarpieces and dioramas, which were featured in two solo exhibitions in San Francisco in 1990 and 1993. From 2008, she created ceramic sculptures, acknowledging the influence of Mexican folk art and making Day of the Dead pieces. Her works are held in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and the Portland Art Museum.

Stuber (film)

Stuber is a 2019 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Michael Dowse and written by Tripper Clancy. Its plot follows a mild-mannered Uber driver named Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) who picks up a passenger (Dave Bautista) who turns out to be a cop hot on the trail of a brutal killer. Iko Uwais, Natalie Morales, Betty Gilpin, Jimmy Tatro, Mira Sorvino, and Karen Gillan also star.
The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 13, 2019 and was theatrically released in the United States by 20th Century Fox on July 12, 2019. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized it for not taking full advantage of its potential but praised Nanjiani and Bautista's chemistry.
Plot.
Vic Manning, an aggressive Los Angeles Police Department detective, is in pursuit of notorious drug lord Oka Tedjo, who six months earlier murdered Vic's partner, Sara Morris, after which Vic's superior, Captain McHenry, places him on leave. Because his pursuit of Tedjo during that encounter was hampered when his glasses were knocked off his face, Vic undergoes corrective laser eye surgery. This requires him to remain off duty for an additional day or two, due to his reduced vision as his eyes heal. However, when an informant contacts him with a lead on Tedjo's current whereabouts, he calls for an Uber and is picked up by Stu Prasad, an unassuming driver who diligently performs his job with an eye on the reviews he receives on the Uber app.
Vic's investigation leads him and a reluctant Stu around Los Angeles. Along the way, Stu deals with both Vic's violent and reckless behavior and his own feelings for a woman named Becca, a close friend and business partner with whom he plans to open a spin biking business. Becca, having broken up with her boyfriend, wants Stu to come over for casual sex, but Stu is genuinely in love with her and wants a more serious relationship. As Stu and Vic get to know one another, they confront each other about Stu's lack of courage with Becca, while Stu criticizes Vic for his toxic masculinity and his insensitive treatment of his daughter Nicole, a sculptor.
At a house in Long Beach, Vic detains a key suspect of his investigation and rescues a Pit Bull Terrier named Pico from being fed packets of drugs. After Stu accidentally shoots the suspect in the leg, Vic leads them to an animal hospital, where both the suspect and Pico receive medical attention from the vet. After Vic learns from the suspect that Tedjo will be making a drug drop later that night, they are ambushed by a group of Tedjo's men, who taunt Vic about his daughter's art exhibition that same evening. With Stu's help, Vic dispatches the thugs and races to Nicole's exhibition to warn her about the potential danger, but she is fed up with her father's obsession with hunting down Tedjo. Afterwards, Stu drops off Vic near the drop location and calls Becca, admitting to her his feelings for her, but then telling her they cannot be friends anymore since he knows she does not feel the same way. At the drop Vic calls for backup but Stu notices only a lone police car heading his way.
As he waits for Tedjo, McHenry arrives and Vic finds out that she is a dirty cop who has been working with Tedjo and was planning to frame Vic for murder to get him off their trail. However, before she can kill Vic, Stu runs her over and the two unsuccessfully attempt to escape from Tedjo in his car. As they struggle against him, Nicole arrives having tracked down Stu using the Uber app and is nearly shot by Tedjo. Stu takes the bullet however, and Vic almost kills Tedjo before Nicole stops him. The police arrive to bring Tedjo to justice.
As Stu and Vic recover in the hospital, Vic gives Stu a five-star Uber review (despite the $5534.95 fare he has to pay him), while Becca has started up a successful spin biking business on her own. That Christmas, Vic arrives at Nicole's home with Pico, only to discover that Nicole is dating Stu.
Production.
Development.
In April 2016, 20th Century Fox bought the spec script "Stuber" from Tripper Clancy for a mid-six figure deal, with Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley set to produce the film.
Casting.
In December 2017, Dave Bautista was cast as a "detective who commandeers an unsuspecting Uber driver named Stu" while Michael Dowse was announced as the director of the film. In March 2018, Kumail Nanjiani signed on to costar with Bautista. In April 2018, Iko Uwais joined the cast. In May 2018, Betty Gilpin, Natalie Morales, Mira Sorvino, Steve Howey, and Amin Joseph joined the cast.
Filming.
Principal photography commenced on May 3, 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia and was shot until July 2, 2018.
Release.
"Stuber" had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 13, 2019 and was released on July 12, 2019. Following their acquisition of 20th Century Fox, which took place a week after the film’s premiere, the film was Walt Disney Studios' first film to receive an R-rating by the Motion Picture Association since "The Fifth Estate" (2013).
Home media.
"Stuber" was released on Digital HD on October 1, 2019, and was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD on October 15, 2019.
Reception.
Box office.
"Stuber" has grossed $22.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $9.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $32.2 million.
In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $7–15 million from 3,050 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.1 million on its first day, including $750,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $8 million, finishing fourth at the box office. In its second weekend the film made $4.1 million, dropping 50% and finishing sixth.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 215 reviews, with an average rating of 5.06/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Though it makes a strong case for future collaborations between Kumail Nanjiani and Dave Bautista, "Stuber" fails to mesh its contrasting genres, settling for an overtly violent, mildly entertaining diversion that's far from a five-star ride." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 3.5 out of 5 stars and a 51% "definite recommend".
Peter Debruge of "Variety" gave the film a positive review and wrote: "It's both funny and familiar to see these two incredibly different personalities thrust together for what's meant to be a short ride."
Glenn Kenny, writing for "RogerEbert.com", said "The only thing worse than hot garbage is elaborately lukewarm mediocrity, and for too much of its running time, the new comedy "Stuber" is just that." Simon Thompson of IGN wrote: ""Stuber" is an awkward, uneven action-comedy that never realizes its full potential. It squanders a good premise and an odd couple pairing with potential that could have delivered something special." A. A. Dowd of "The A.V. Club" gave the film a grade C−, calling it "a big waste of talent".

Kagome metal

Kagome metal is a ferromagnetic quantum material that was first used in literature in 2011 for a compound of Fe3Sn2. However, this material had been created for several decades. In this material, metal atoms are arranged in a lattice resembling the Japanese "kagome" basket weaving pattern. The same material has also been termed as "kagome magnet" since 2018. Kagome metal (or magnets) refer to a new class of magnetic quantum materials hosting kagome lattice and topological band structure. They include 3-1 materials (example: antiferromagnet Mn3Sn), 1-1 materials (example: paramagnet CoSn), 1-6-6 materials (example: ferrimagnet TbMn6Sn6), 3-2-2 materials (example: hard ferromagnet Co3Sn2S2), and 3-2 materials (example: soft ferromagnet Fe3Sn2), thus demonstrating a variety of crystal and magnetic structures. They generally feature a 3d transition metal based magnetic kagome lattice with an in-plane lattice constant ~5.5Å. Their 3d electrons dominate the low-energy electronic structure in these quantum materials, thus exhibiting electronic correlation. Crucially, the kagome lattice electrons generally feature Dirac band crossings and flat band, which are the source for nontrivial band topology. Moreover, they all contain the heavy element Sn, which can provide strong spin-orbit coupling to the system. Therefore, this is an ideal system to explore the rich interplay between geometry, correlation, and topology. 
In the Kagome structure, atoms are arranged into layered sets of overlapping triangles so that there exist large empty hexagonal spaces. Electrons in the metal experience a "three-dimensional cousin of the quantum Hall effect". The inherent magnetism of the metal and the quantum-mechanical magnetism induce electrons to flow around the edges of the triangular crystals, akin to superconductivity. Unlike superconductivity, this structure and behavior is stable at room temperature. Other structures were shown to exhibit the quantum hall effect at very low temperatures with an external magnetic field as high as 1 million times the strength that of the earth. By building metal out of a ferromagnetic material, that exterior magnetic field was no longer necessary, and the quantum Hall effect persists into room temperature.
The Kagome alloy Fe3Sn2 displayed several exotic quantum electronic behaviors that add to its quantum topology. The lattice harbors massive Dirac fermions, Berry curvature, band gaps, and spin-orbit activity, all of which are conducive to the Hall Effect and zero energy loss electric currents. These behaviors are promising for the development of technologies in quantum computing, spin superconductors, and low power electronics. , more Kagome materials displaying similar topology were being experimented with, such as in magnetically doped Weyl-Semimetals Co2MnGa and Co3Sn2S2.
Development.
March 2018 experiment.
The experiment published in "Nature" was led by Linda Ye and Mingu Kang from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Physics. The other researches published in the article were: Junwei Liu (MIT), Felix von Cube (Harvard), Christina R. Wicker (MIT), Takehito Suzuki (MIT), Chris Jozwiak (Berkeley Labs), Aaron Bostwick (Berkeley Labs), Eli Rotenberg (Berkeley Labs), David C. Bell (Harvard), Liang Fu (MIT), Riccardo Comin (MIT), and Joseph G. Checkelsky (MIT).
The team constructed a Kagome lattice using an iron and tin alloy Fe3Sn2. When Fe3Sn2 is heated to about 750℃ (1380°F), the alloy naturally assumes a Kagome lattice structure. To maintain this structure at room temperature, the team cooled it in an ice bath. The resulting structure had iron atoms at the corners of each triangle surrounding tin atoms, the tin atoms stabilizing the large empty hexagonal space.
The photo-electronic structure of this metal was mapped at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's Advanced Light Source beamlines 7.0.2 MAESTRO and 4.0.3 MERLIN. The measurements taken here mapped the band structures of the metal under a current and showed “the double-Dirac-cone structure corresponding to Dirac Fermions”. A 30 meV gap between cones was shown, which is indicative of the Hall effect and massive Dirac fermions.
The experiment was published in "Nature" on March 19, 2018.
Expansions upon the 2018 experiment.
Linda Ye and the rest of the MIT team continued working with the kagome metal, looking into more properties on Fe3Sn2 and other iron-tin alloys. According to an article published by the team on October 25, 2019 in "Nature Communications," the lattice was shown to exhibit spin-orbit coupling de Haas van Alphen oscillations and Fermi surfaces. The team also continued to modify the structure of the metal, and in an article published in "Nature Materials" on December 9, 2019, they found that FeSn in a 1 to 1 ratio exhibited a more “ideal” lattice. The two-dimensional layers with iron and tin in the kagome shape were separated by a layer entirely of tin, allowing them to have separate band structures. This structure showed both massive Dirac fermions and electronic band structures where electrons do not occur.

Gaius Anicius Cerialis

Gaius Anicius Cerialis (died 66) was a Roman senator who was active during the Principate. He was suffect consul in the second half of the year 65 as the colleague of Gaius Pomponius Pius.
Beyond his consulate, Cerialis appears three times in history. The first time was during the reign of Caligula when he was accused of "majestas" against the emperor. Cassius Dio provides a confused account. Steven H. Rutledge provides an interpretation that makes sense of Dio: Cerialis and another senator, Sextus Papinius, were tortured, but neither provided any information. The emperor then offered to spare Papinius' life if he were to denounce his fellow conspirators, which he did; Caligula then had both "Cerialis" and the men he named executed. It is likely that by "Cerialis" Dio means Papinius, for Anicius Cerialis is very much alive years later.
The year before his election as consul the Pisonian conspiracy was uncovered. Nero delivered a speech wherein he shared the news and named the conspirators, and their punishments. The Senate then voted for a thanksgiving, and other acts flattering the emperor. Tacitus recounts other servile acts, which includes an account based on the "Acta Senatus" that Cerialis proposed a temple be built as soon as possible at public expense to "the Divine Nero".
The last time Cerialis appears in history is also during the reign of Nero. The year after Cerialis' consulate, in AD 66, Tacitus recounts how a "delator", or informer, accused Annaeus Mela under the "lex maiestas". Faced with certain destruction, Mela made his will and committed suicide. In his will, he accused Rufrius Crispinus, a former commander of the Praetorian guard, and Cerialis of "majestas". Tacitus states that it was commonly believed Mela named Crispinus because the man had already taken his life; Cerialis was named because Mela wanted him dead. Cerialis soon afterwards committed suicide to avoid prosecution.

Kompoloi

In the plain of Leivithra in 1997 began the excavation work on the ancient winery Kompoloi (Greek: Κομπολόι). They lasted (intermittently) until October 2000.
Location.
Approximately 500 meters east of the highway A1 (E 75) and 700 meters west of the coastline of Skotina.
The building.
The building was erected in the middle of the 4th century BC and used until the beginning of the 3rd century BC; then it was destroyed by a fire and abandoned by its inhabitants. It has a floor area of around 1350 m2 and was built on an existing vineyard. Two buildings, a residential building and a farmhouse, stood at a central courtyard; in the north and south there were other buildings. The excavated building had 17 rooms. In the east, a cellar was uncovered whose foundations probably bore a tower. Next to the southern entrance was a well and an oven.
The finds.
Clay pots, pithoi (πίθοι), in which the wine was stored were buried in the ground. In total, 32 of these vessels were found. The height was 2.15 meters, the diameter 1.60 meters, the material was 3 - 4 cm thick. The capacity was nearly 2000 liters. One of these pithoi is exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. Furthermore, lead clamps for repairing the vessels, clay lids, grape seeds and resin were found.
The viniculture.
Archaeobotanical investigations showed that as early as the 4th millennium BC wine was cultivated in middle east. A little later, wine was grown in Thrace and thus reached the region of Mount Olympus. Harvested at the end of August, the grapes were pressed and filled into the pithoi. At least every 36 days, the containers were opened and the contents checked. On the first day of Anthesteria, a feast in honor of the god Dionysus, the clay vessels were finally opened and the wine could be drunk.

College career.
Following his senior season, Jones was selected to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl.
Professional career.
On November 29, 2017, it was announced that Jones had accepted his invitation to play in the Senior Bowl. He impressed scouts by showing his agility during Senior Bowl practices and added value to his draft stock. On January 27, 2018, Jones played in the 2018 Reese's Senior Bowl and was part of Denver Broncos' head coach Vance Joseph's South team that lost 45–16 to the North team, coached by Houston Texans' head coach Bill O'Brien. Jones attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and completed all of the combine and positional drills. On March 19, 2018, he participated at NC State's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional drills and the short shuttle. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Jones was projected to be a fifth or sixth round pick by NFL draft experts 
and scouts. He was ranked as the 14th best defensive tackle prospect in the draft by Scouts Inc. and was ranked the 20th best defensive tackle by DraftScout.com.
The Los Angeles Chargers selected Jones in the third round (84th overall) in the 2018 NFL Draft. Jones was the eighth defensive tackle drafted in 2018. 
On May 13, 2018, the Los Angeles Chargers signed Jones to a four-year, $3.62 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $854,140.
On September 26, 2020, Jones was placed on injured reserve with a shoulder injury. He was activated on October 24.

Paul Ziemiak

Paul Ziemiak (born 6 September 1985 as "Paweł Ziemiak") is a German politician who has been serving as General Secretary of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) since 8 December 2018, under the leadership of leaders Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Armin Laschet. He is a member of the Bundestag.
From 2014 until 2018, Ziemiak served as federal chairman of the Junge Union Deutschlands, in this capacity being a part of the CDU leadership under chairwoman Angela Merkel. In the 2017 federal election, he was elected to the Bundestag on the CDU party list.
Early life and career.
Ziemiak was born in Szczecin, Polish People's Republic. He moved to then-West Germany in 1988 with his parents, who wanted to escape the conditions of Communist Poland and the Eastern Bloc. The Ziemiaks were among the around 140,000 Polish citizens who left for Germany in that year, shortly before the Fall of Communism. Claiming partial German descent, they obtained citizenship under Germany's right of return laws and lived for a year in a refugee camp in Massen next to non-western asylum seekers. Ziemiak has said the facility was often visited by the police and that he befriended a Roma family that also lived there. After a year they settled permanently in Iserlohn. Both his parents had been doctors in Poland, but their qualifications were not recognised in West Germany and they had to retrain as interns in German hospitals before obtaining their German licenses and finding employment. Ziemiak grew up bilingual, with parents who were native Polish speakers and who only spoke German as a foreign language. He has said the family was culturally Polish and that Germany only gradually felt like home.
After graduation Ziemiak studied law at the Universität Osnabrück and the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster but failed the first legal exam on both attempts. He then enrolled at the Business and Information Technology School in Iserlohn to study corporate communications.
Since 2005 Ziemiak has been a member of the Catholic fraternity "AV Widukind Osnabrück" within the CV. Furthermore, he is a member of the Catholic student fraternity "KDStV Winfridia (Breslau) Münster".
Political career.
Ziemiak joined the Young Union in 1998, and in 2001 the CDU. From 1999 to 2001 he was the first chairman of the newly founded Children and Youth Parliament of the city of Iserlohn. In 2002 he became a member of the district council of the Junge Union in the Märkischer Kreis. In 2006 he was elected to the state board of the JU NRW. In 2007 he became a member of the executive state board. In 2009 he took over the leadership of the district association of the Junge Union Südwestfalen ("South Westphalia"). Since 2011 he has been serving as chairman of the CDU Iserlohn and member of the board of the CDU parliamentary group in the council of the city Iserlohn. In addition, he is a member of the district executive committee of the CDU Südwestfalen.
Chairman of the Young Union, 2012–2018.
On 25 November 2012 Ziemiak was elected state chairman of the Junge Union NRW and held this office until 15 November 2014. In 2014, he won the vote for the presidency of the Junge Union against Benedict Poettering and won with 63 percent of the vote. It was the first battle candidacy for this position since 1973. Ziemiak thus is a member of the CDU federal board and replaced Philipp Missfelder, who did not run again. On 14 October 2016, Ziemiak was again elected Federal Chairman with 85 percent of the vote. 
In February 2017, Ziemiak was a member of the 16th Federal Assembly for the election of the Federal President. 
In addition to his political career, Ziemiak worked with consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers until entering parliament.
Member of Parliament, 2017–present.
In the federal election 2017, Ziemiak ran as successor to Ingrid Fischbach in the constituency Herne – Bochum II, but lost to Michelle Müntefering. Nevertheless, he moved to the Bundestag via the state party list. He has since been serving on the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
In the negotiations to form a fourth coalition government under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, Ziemiak was part of the working group on families, women, seniors and youth, led by Annette Widmann-Mauz, Angelika Niebler and Katarina Barley.
Secretary General of the CDU, 2018–present.
The new CDU party leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer nominated Ziemiak on 8 December 2018 as Secretary General. He was elected on the same day, with 63 percent of the delegates voting for him as the only candidate for the role. At the time of the vote, Ziemiak's nomination was widely interpreted as sign of Kramp-Karrenbauer' willingness to build bridges to the defeated conservatives around her opponents Friedrich Merz and Jens Spahn.
Political positions.
Within the CDU, Ziemiak represents the party’s more conservative wing. For example, he has stated that he is opposed to a revision of German criminal law paragraph 219a, which prohibits public advertisement of abortion procedures.

Vero (app)

Vero (stylized as VERO) is a social media platform and mobile app company. Vero markets itself as a social network free from advertisements, data mining and algorithms.
History.
The app was founded by Lebanese billionaire Ayman Hariri who is the son of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri. The name is taken from the Esperanto word for truth. The app launched officially in 2015 as an alternative to Facebook and their popular photo-blogging app Instagram. Within weeks of its release the app surged in popularity although users expressed mixed reports with some feeling confused about how the app worked.
Cosplayers were early to adopt the app as their photo-sharing platform of choice, favouring the app's pinch and zoom magnification feature over Instagram's zoom feature. Other creative communities soon followed, and the app became popular with niche groups of makeup artists, tattoo artists, and skateboarders.
In March 2018, Vero's popularity surged, partly helped by an exodus from Facebook and Instagram following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. In the wake of the scandal, Vero devised an advertising campaign aimed at defected Facebook and Instagram users, hoping the app's policies and privacy settings would assuage concerns over sharing personal information on the internet. Within the space of one week&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; the app went from being a small service, akin to Ello or Peach, to being the most downloaded app in eighteen countries.
In December 2020, VERO released its most significant update to date, VERO 2.0 which introduced new features including voice and video calls, game and app posts and bookmarks, and refinements to the UI.
Concept and funding.
Vero's content feed resembles Instagram's although users can share a wider variety of content and the app has a chronological content feed whereas Facebook and Instagram's feeds are algorithm based. Vero's business plan is also distinct from similar social media apps. Whereas its competitors such as Facebook or Instagram make money from in-app advertising revenue and the sale of user data&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; Vero's business plan was to invite the first one million users to use the app for free then charge any subsequent users a subscription fee.  
The app was entirely funded by its founder and generated additional revenues by charging affiliate fees when someone buys a product they find on Vero.
Awards.
VERO was recognized at the 2021 Webbys, being named as an Honoree in the Best Visual Design - Aesthetic Category.
Controversies.
Privacy.
Vero has faced some criticism over the wording of their manifesto, in particular;
“Vero only collects the data we believe is necessary to provide users with a great experience and to ensure the security of their accounts.” – Vero Manifesto. 
Because this policy does not implicitly state that the app will not sell data on to third parties some users fear that the need to monetise the app through data might prove too tempting. There have also been concerns over Vero's broad terms of service which grant Vero rights over how it uses its user's content.
Users have also complained about not being able to delete their accounts. While this was never the case, the option was hidden deep in the app's settings.
Russian involvement.
Although Vero remains transparent about the app's Russian development team, they have been caught up in concerns about Russian interference on social media platforms. The app's founder Ayman Hariri was quick to dismiss the remarks as xenophobic and defend the nationality of his employees, stating in an interview with Time Magazine; “At the end of the day, where people are from is really not how anybody should judge anyone”.
Criticism of the app’s founder.
Until 2013, Vero's founder Ayman Harari was deputy CEO and chairman of Saudi Oger, the Saudi Arabian construction company which collapsed in 2017, mired by controversies over the welfare and treatment of their employees. However, Hariri is quick to point out that he divested from the firm in 2014 and the worker's rights violations occurred after he had left the company.

Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien)

The Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien) ("True Flabby Preludes for a Dog") is a 1912 piano composition by Erik Satie. The first of his published humoristic piano suites of the 1910s, it signified a breakthrough in his creative development and in the public perception of his music. In performance it lasts about 5 minutes.
Satie biographer Rollo H. Myers, writing in 1948, remarked on the prophetic nature of this seemingly unassuming keyboard suite: "In the heyday of Impressionism...came the "Flabby Preludes" which in their linear austerity heralded the Neoclassic vogue which was to dominate Western music during the nineteen-twenties."
Background.
The "Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien)" represents Satie's determination to reconcile his belated education at the Schola Cantorum in Paris under Vincent d'Indy (1905-1912) with his own natural sense of wit and fantasy. It was in fact his second attempt at creating a composition on a canine theme, an idea that had long obsessed him. In July 1912 Satie composed his piano suite "Préludes flasques (pour un chien)", but after it was rejected for publication by the Durand firm he informed his protégé Alexis Roland-Manuel that he was going to rewrite it from scratch. The three pieces of the new set were completed between August 12 and August 23, 1912. On September 13 Satie offered it to publisher E. Demets, who not only bought the work on the spot (for 50 francs) but asked for more. This modest triumph convinced Satie that he was on the right creative path at last. On November 23, 1912, he formally ended his studies with d'Indy. As Robert Orledge noted, "Once Satie could laugh at the Schola and himself he was back on course." The "Véritables Préludes flasques" were published the following month. Unlike Durand, Demets saw commercial potential in the amusing novelty of the "Préludes". The firm would publish 10 of Satie's humoristic piano suites over the next four years.
Music and texts.
Despite Satie's description of them as "flabby", the three "Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien)" are lean, dry, and starkly contrapuntal:
Composer Charles Koechlin observed that here Satie "gets rid of repetitions and redundancies. He prunes, throws out ballast, suppresses held notes, condenses, reduces the musical dialogue to a strict minimum."
Biographer Pierre-Daniel Templier noted that "The novelty of the flabby preludes came as a charming surprise. Yet Satie's imagination is still kept in check here. "Sévère réprimande", a lively and emphatic toccata with singing bass chords; "Seul à la maison", a delightful two-part invention; "On joue", with lightly bouncing fourths and fifths and minor sevenths climbing menacingly up the keyboard: no trace of humor here, in the music. But the directions are in mock Latin..." These Latin directions include "corpulentus" (fat), "epotus" (drunken), "caeremoniosus" (ceremonially), "paululum" (tiny), "opacus" (shady) and, in a possible dig at d'Indy, "paedagogus" (schoolmaster).
Performance.
Satie dedicated the "Véritables Préludes flasques (pour un chien)" to pianist Ricardo Viñes, who gave the successful premiere of the work at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique at the Salle Pleyel in Paris on April 5, 1913. Viñes would become the foremost champion of Satie's keyboard music through the early 1920s, premiering several of his compositions. Satie was delighted by the "irresistibly droll air of secrecy" of his interpretations. Viñes was also the piano teacher of Francis Poulenc, an important Satie protégé and future member of Les Six.

Nabiha Ben Miled

Nabiha Ben Miled (, 4 March 1919-6 May 2009) was a pioneering, Tunisian women's rights activist and independentist, who was a leader in the press for women's rights and Tunisian independence from French colonialism. She served as president of the Union of Tunisian Women from 1952 to 1963 and wrote articles in favor of Tunisia's independence.
Early life.
Nabiha Ben Abdallah was born on 4 March 1919 in Tunis, which at the time was located in the French protectorate of Tunisia to Baya Bint Mahjoub and Othman Bin Abdallah. Her parents were part of the Tunisian bourgeoisie, whose ancestors had settled in Tunis in the nineteenth century. She attended Sidi Saber Primary School and had aspirations to become a teacher, or a lawyer, but her father discouraged her from further studies after she graduated from primary school. At the age of fifteen, she married the doctor , who had been educated in France and was a leader in the Tunisian Communist Movement. Though her mother had insisted that she wear her hijab as a child, her husband was modern and encouraged Miled to live without being veiled.
Activism.
With the encouragement of her husband, in 1936, Miled joined the (MWUT), led by Bchira Ben Mrad. Initially formed to support the education of girls, by 1938, they had extended their aims to provide assistance to political prisoners and those involved in the independence movement, seeking an end to the French colonial government. When demonstrators were injured during a protest on 9 April 1938, Dr. Miled turned their home into a hospital and Nabiha assisted him, providing nursing services for those injured by the colonial forces. During World War II, she gave birth to the couple's only daughter, Khadija, during a severe famine. She and her husband provided boxed milk to neighbors in their Halfaouine neighborhood and she organized a soup kitchen. Using contacts with local merchants, Miled led the neighborhood women to make two hundred meals each day from products donated by local merchants.
In 1944, Miled left the MWUT, disillusioned by the lack of action of the group and its reliance on the political party Destour. She joined the Tunisian Women's Union (TWU) (), which was affiliated with the Tunisian Communist Party. Her ideological crisis had come about because the leadership of Destour, rather than demanding Tunisian autonomy, was in favor liberalization through a modification of the current constitution. Miled was in favor of the more radical approach, which combined nationalist goals with social improvement programs aimed at providing women's rights and schooling opportunities for disadvantaged children. In 1951, she was appointed to serve on the board of the TWU and the following year became president of the organization, serving in that capacity until it was dissolved in 1963 for its close ties to the communist party. From 1952, she also helped her husband, Mohamed El Salami, and Mohamed Saleh Ka'far write and clandestinely deliver the newspaper "Commandos", which urged Tunisians to become involved in liberating themselves and fight for their right to nationhood.
Rather than join the , which Miled saw as too closely allied with the one-party state, she left the formal women's movements, though she continued to publish articles in a French magazine, "The Proletarian Revolution" until her death. With her children grown, she began working as a social worker at the Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis, but resigned when the staff began to pressure her to inform on colleagues and adhere to religious practices. In 1993 a history of the women involved in the nationalist movement in Tunisia, "Mémoire de femmes: Tunisiennes dans la vie publique, 1920–1960" (Memoirs of women: Tunisians in public life, 1920–1960) contained a biographical sketch of Miled.
Death and legacy.
Miled died in Tunis on 6 May 2009. In 2013, the Ilhem Marzouki Feminist University () held a tribute in her memory to honor the contributions of historic women to feminism in Tunisia.

Ulva in literature and the arts

Ulva in literature and the arts refers to the literary and artistic connections to the island of Ulva in the Hebrides of Scotland.
During the 18th and 19th centuries in particular many famous literary figures visited the island including Dr Johnson, Walter Scott and James Hogg and there are numerous written works about the island as a result. The island also had a piping school at one time and Beatrix Potter was a visitor during the 20th century.
Boswell and Johnson.
Dr Johnson and Boswell visited The MacQuarrie on Ulva in October 1773, the year after Sir Joseph Banks brought Staffa to the English-speaking world's attention. Perhaps aware that Banks considered that the columnar basalt cliff formations on Ulva called "The Castles" rivalled Staffa's Johnson wrote:
When the islanders were reproached with their ignorance or insensibility of the wonders of Staffa, they had not much to reply. They had indeed considered it little, because they had always seen it; and none but philosophers, nor they always, are struck with wonder otherwise than by novelty.
Both men left separate accounts of the visit, Johnson in "A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland" (18 January 1775) and Boswell in "Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, LL.D" (1785). They arrived on Saturday, 16 October, and left the following day. Johnson wrote:
We resolved not to embarrass a family, in a time of so much sorrow, if any other expedient could he found; and as the Island of Ulva was over-against us, it was determined that we should pass the strait and have recourse to the Laird, who, like the other gentlemen of the Islands, was known to Col. We expected to find a ferry-boat, but when at last we came to the water, the boat was gone.
We were now again at a stop. It was the sixteenth of October, a time when it is not convenient to sleep in the Hebrides without a cover, and there was no house within our reach, but that which we had already declined.
Boswell said:
We were in hopes to get to Sir Allan Maclean's at Inchkenneth,
to-night; but the eight miles [13 km], of which our road was said to consist,
were so very long, that we did not reach the opposite coast of Mull
till seven at night, though we had set out about eleven in the
forenoon; and when we did arrive there, we found the wind strong
against us. Col determined that we should pass the night at
M'Quarrie's, in the island of Ulva, which lies between Mull and
Inchkenneth; and a servant was sent forward to the ferry, to secure
the boat for us: but the boat was gone to the Ulva side, and the wind
was so high that the people could not hear him call; and the night so
dark that they could not see a signal. We should have been in a very
bad situation, had there not fortunately been lying in the little
sound of Ulva an Irish vessel, the "Bonnetta", of Londonderry, Captain
M'Lure, master. He himself was at M'Quarrie's; but his men obligingly
came with their long-boat, and ferried us over.(Boswell)
Boswell was not impressed with Macquarrie's house, but appears to have enjoyed the company:
M'Quarrie's house was mean; but we were agreeably surprised with the
appearance of the master, whom we found to be intelligent, polite, and
much a man of the world. Though his clan is not numerous, he is a very
ancient chief, and has a burial place at Icolmkill [Iona]. He told us, his
family had possessed Ulva for nine hundred years; but I was distressed
to hear that it was soon to be sold for the payment of his debts.
Captain M'Lure, whom we found here, was of Scotch extraction, and
properly a M'Leod, being descended of some of the M'Leods who went
with Sir Normand [sic] of Bernera to the battle of Worcester, and after the
defeat of the royalists, fled to Ireland, and, to conceal themselves,
took a different name. He told me, there was a great number of them
about Londonderry; some of good property. I said, they should now
resume their real name. The Laird of M'Leod should go over, and
assemble them, and make them all drink the large horn full, and from
that time they should be M'Leods. The captain informed us, he had
named his ship the "Bonnetta", out of gratitude to Providence; for once,
when he was sailing to America with a good number of passengers, the
ship in which he then sailed was becalmed for five weeks, and during
all that time, numbers of the fish bonnetta swam close to her, and
were caught for food; he resolved therefore, that the ship he should
next get, should be called the Bonnetta.(Boswell)
Johnson too admired the antiquity of the family, but did not care for the landscape too much:
To Ulva we came in the dark, and left it before noon the next day. A very exact description therefore will not be expected. We were told, that it is an Island of no great extent, rough and barren, inhabited by the Macquarrys; a clan not powerful nor numerous, but of antiquity, which most other families are content to reverence [...] Of the ancestors of Macquarry, who thus lies hid in his unfrequented Island, I have found memorials in all places where they could be expected.
Great though the age of the Macquarries may have been, it appears at this point that they were considering selling it, and that the house was in a state of disrepair, despite the hospitality:
Talking of the sale of an estate of an ancient family, which was said to have been purchased much under its value by the confidential lawyer of that family, and it being mentioned that the sale would probably be set aside by a suit in equity, Dr Johnson said, 'I am very willing that this sale should be set aside, but I doubt much whether the suit will be successful; for the argument for avoiding the sale is founded on vague and indeterminate principles, as that the price was too low, and that there was a great degree of confidence placed by the seller in the person who became the purchaser. Now, how low should a price be? or what degree of confidence should there be to make a bargain be set aside? a bargain, which is a wager of skill between man and man. If, indeed, any fraud can be proved, that will do.'
When Dr Johnson and I were by ourselves at night, I observed of our host, "aspectum generosum habet." "Et generosum animum," he added. For fear of being overheard in the small Highland houses, I often talked to him in such Latin as I could speak, and with as much of the English accent as I could assume, so as not to be understood, in case our conversation should be too loud for the space.
We had each an elegant bed in the same room; and here it was that a circumstance occurred, as to which he has been strangely misunderstood. From his description of his chamber, it has erroneously been supposed, that his bed being too short for him, his feet, during the night, were in the mire; whereas he has only said, that when he undressed, he felt his feet in the mire: that is, the clay-floor of the room, on which he stood before he went into bed, was wet, in consequence of the windows being broken, which let in the rain.(Boswell)
Johnson heard later on that the island had been sold to Capt. Dugald Campbell of Achnaba, and wrote to him:
Every eye must look with pain on a Campbell turning the MacQuarries at will out of their "sedes avitae", their hereditary island.
Scott, Hogg and other visitors.
Boswell and Johnson were not the only famous non-Highland visitors to the island. Walter Scott and James Hogg also visited the islands some decades later. In 1810 Scott discussed the prospect of a visit, which he describes as a "jaunt":
Among all my hopes &amp; fears the uppermost thought is that you will be down this year. I have a prospect of a nice jaunt to the Hebrides with a light sloop &amp; eight men belonging to Staffa, MacDonald, who would be delighted to receive you at Ulva — The ladies could remain at Oban if they were afraid of the Sea. But you must wipe your minds eye pull up the breeches of your resolution and set forth as soon as possible for we must get to the Hebrides early in July unless we mean to encounter long nights &amp; tempestuous weather 
Scott was struck by the contrast between Ulva and the nearby island of Inchkenneth:
"... a most beautiful islet of the most verdant green, while all the neighbouring shore of Greban, as well as the large islands of Colinsay and Ulva, are as black as heath can make them. But Ulva has a good anchorage, and Inchkenneth is surrounded by shoals."
By the time Scott visited the "mean" house of Boswell's journal was gone, and replaced by one from a design by Robert Adam. This in turn has been destroyed, and the current Ulva House is on its site.
Hogg wrote some graffiti on the wall of Ulva Inn, now lost due to its burning down in 1880:
Naturally, the locals were slightly upset by this, and the Minister of Ulva, Rev. MacLeod wrote the following reply, with a sly pun referring to Jesus' "Discourse on holiness" from the Sermon on the Mount:
After his visit, Walter Scott used Ulva as material for various works, for example, in his 1815 poem, "Lord of the Isles" (Canto 4)
The "Colonsay" referred to here, is probably nearby Little Colonsay rather than Colonsay itself. In "Tales of a Grandfather", Scott tells the story of "Alan-a-Sop" (an anglicisation of the Gaelic for "Alan of the straw", so called because he was born "on a heap of straw") who was born the illegitimate son of the Maclean of Duart in the 16th century. In his youth, Alan-a-Sop was treated badly by his stepfather, one Maclean of Torloisk. He grew up to be a pirate and eventually took a bloody revenge on Torloisk with the help of MacQuarrie of Ulva.
Many other visitors to neighbouring Staffa stayed at Ulva Inn, this included Keats, Mendelssohn, and William Wordsworth.
David Livingstone.
The famous Scottish missionary and explorer of Africa, David Livingstone recounted how his ancestors had originally come from Ulva.
Livingstone recounted how Ulva had a great store of folklore, and legends, which his grandfather told them:
"Our grandfather was intimately acquainted with all the traditionary legends which that great writer [Walter Scott] has since made use of in the "Tales of a Grandfather" and other works. As a boy I remember listening to him with delight, for his memory was stored with a never-ending stock of stories, many of which were wonderfully like those I have since heard while sitting by the African evening fires. Our grandmother, too, used to sing Gaelic songs, some of which, as she believed, had been composed by captive islanders languishing hopelessly among the Turks [i.e. Moroccan pirates].
"Grandfather could give particulars of the lives of his ancestors for six generations of the family before him; and the only point of the tradition I feel proud of is this: One of these poor hardy islanders was renowned in the district for great wisdom and prudence; and it is related that, when he was on his death-bed, he called all his children around him and said,
Livingstone also recorded the religion of the yellow stick, which is more connected with the Small Isles.
If, therefore, in the following pages I fall into any errors, I hope they will be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as indicating that I have forgotten our ancient motto. This event took place at a time when the Highlanders, according to Macaulay, were much like the Cape Caffres ["kaffirs"], and any one, it was said, could escape punishment for cattle-stealing by presenting a share of the plunder to his chieftain. Our ancestors were Roman Catholics; they were made Protestants by the laird coming round with a man having a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted more attention than his teaching, for the new religion went long afterward, perhaps it does so still, by the name of “the religion of the yellow stick”.
Like many Gaels in the 19th century, Livingstone's grandfather was forced to emigrate to the Lowlands for work:
"Finding his farm in Ulva insufficient to support a numerous family, my grandfather removed to Blantyre Works, a large cotton manufactory on the beautiful Clyde, above Glasgow; and his sons, having had the best education the Hebrides afforded, were gladly received as clerks by the proprietors, Monteith and Co. He himself, highly esteemed for his unflinching honesty, was employed in the conveyance of large sums of money from Glasgow to the works, and in old age was, according to the custom of that company, pensioned off, so as to spend his declining years in ease and comfort."
Andrew Ross says David Livingstone was the second son of Neil Livingston (known as "Niall Beag", wee Neil, or "Niall MacDhun-lèibhe"), who was born on Ulva in 1788, who was in turn the son of another Neil. He also claims that the family stories do not quite fit, and that it is unlikely that he was a descendant of a Culloden combatant. A Mull legend also says that Neil (grandfather) may have been driven from his house by redcoats in the middle of a snowstorm. However, there is no evidence for this. He also notes that Neil's church on Ulva had given the following letter of recommendation of their parishioner, something no doubt David was proud of.
MacArthur's piping school.
A piper named MacArthur set up a famous piping school on Ulva in the 18th century. He himself was trained by the great MacCrimmon dynasty of Skye, whose piping skills were legendary in Gaeldom. The MacArthurs themselves were said to be amongst the greatest bagpipers to come out of Scotland. Allen writes:
The MacCrimmons and the MacArthurs were said to have been the finest pipers and exponents of the "piobaireachd" and history relates great rivalry between the families for supremacy. Both the MacCrimmons and the MacArthurs had colleges for piping students; the former on the farm of Boreraig, eight miles [13 km] south west of Dunvegan Castle on Skye, the latter at Ulva near Mull. For the MacCrimmon pupils seven years study was necessary in their apprenticeship. The pupils had a solitary designated area of open space in which to practice the scales and tunes on the chanter, the Small Pipes and "Piob Mhòr" before being allowed to perform for their Master Tutor. The college at Ulva had four rooms; one for cattle, one for guests to stay, one for practice and one specifically for the use of students. In both cases the countryside was preferred for practice as was, and still is, deemed correct for the "Piob Mhòr".
"Lord Ullin's Daughter".
The most famous commemoration of Ulva in literature is Thomas Campbell's poem, "Lord Ullin's Daughter", written after the writer had visited the region. The opening two stanzas are as follows:
The poem was translated into the Russian language by the Romantic poet Vasiliy Zhukovsky. In Zhukovsky's translation, Lord Ullin's daughter, who is left unnamed in Campbell's original, is given the name Malvina, which the Russian poet borrowed from James Macpherson's "Ossian". Vladimir Nabokov has translated Zhukovsky's translation into English to demonstrate the changes that were made.
"Moladh Ulbha".
"Moladh Ulbha" (In Praise of Ulva) is a song written by the Ulbhach Bard, Colin Fletcher (Cailean Mac an Fhleisdeir). It was transcribed by the Rev. MacKenzie. This is the first verse.
Other authors.
The Rev. Donald MacKenzie (Dòmhnall MacCoinnich), author of "As it Was: Sin Mar a Bha: An Ulva Boyhood" was a noted Gaelic-language author. He was born in Lewis, and his ancestors were from Harris, but he spent a number of years in Ulva itself, from June 1918 onwards. He was formerly minister in Rothesay. Amongst his achievements was a large number of translations of the poems of Robert Burns. He was the last minister on the island.
John MacCormick (; 1870–1947), the author of the first full length Scottish Gaelic novel, "Dùn Aluinn" (1912) was an occasional visitor to the island. He wrote a number of short stories, non-fiction and a novella. He came from Mull, and was a distant relative of the politician of the same name and Neil MacCormick
English children's writer, Beatrix Potter (1866–1943) also visited Ulva from time to time. She was a relative of the Clark family, and "The Tale of Mr. Tod" (1912) is dedicated to F.W. Clark (III - grandson of the man who bought the island). The dedication says rather cryptically: "FOR FRANCIS WILLIAM OF ULVA — SOMEDAY!" Curiously, although the main characters of the book are a fox ("tod") and a badger ("brock"), neither species can be found on Ulva.

Inova Alexandria Hospital

Inova Alexandria Hospital is a not-for-profit hospital in Alexandria, Virginia, United States. Founded in 1872 as the Alexandria Infirmary, it became part of Northern Virginia's Inova Health System in 1997. The hospital is notable for its early contributions in the field of emergency medicine, introducing a 24-hour-a-day emergency department staffed by physicians that has since become the model for emergency care in the United States.
History.
Early years: The Alexandria Infirmary.
The hospital's history dates to the 1872 founding of the Alexandria Infirmary by a group of local women led by Julia Johns, whose father was the bishop of the Episcopal Church Diocese of Virginia, John Johns. A sailor had arrived at the port of Alexandria with typhoid fever, sparking fears of an epidemic, but there was no place to quarantine or treat those with the disease. The infirmary opened in early 1873 at the corner of Duke Street and South Fairfax Street in a townhouse owned by Johns's father. It would move several times in its early decades, occupying multiple facilities within the area now known as Old Town Alexandria. In 1894, the infirmary opened a nursing school, the first in Northern Virginia.
Alexandria Hospital and the Development of Emergency Medicine.
In 1902, the infirmary changed its name to Alexandria Hospital. In 1917, it moved to another new location at the corner of Duke and Washington Streets, where it would remain until the opening of its current campus on Seminary Road, in Alexandria's West End area. The hospital broke ground on the new facility in 1959, and officially opened it in 1962; Vice President of the United States Lyndon Johnson spoke at the opening ceremony. The hospital transitioned its various units to Seminary Road in phases from 1962 until the Duke Street site finally closed in 1974.
As the 1960s began, a group of physicians at Alexandria Hospital played a pivotal role in creating the modern medical specialty of emergency medicine. Before this time, hospital emergency departments (EDs) (also called emergency rooms (ERs)) were generally staffed by physicians on staff at the hospital on a rotating basis, among them family physicians, general surgeons, internists, and a variety of other specialists. In many smaller emergency departments, nurses would triage patients and physicians would be called in based on the type of injury or illness.
In 1961, an Alexandria Hospital general practice physician, Dr. James Mills, recognized that visits to the hospital's emergency department had rapidly increased while staffing had failed to keep pace, since much of the medical staff did not want to serve in the ED. Dissatisfied with his own general practice, Mills recruited three other physicians to work full-time in the emergency department rather than on rotation; the four became "the first group of American doctors to engage in full-time emergency practice." This approach became known as the “Alexandria Plan" and quickly became a model for other hospitals around the country. By 1968, the specialty was established enough to form the American College of Emergency Physicians, of which Mills served as the second president.
Merger with Inova Health System.
By the 1990s, many patients were covered by health insurance plans that provided larger hospital groups with advantages over smaller independent facilities, which led to many mergers and consolidations in the industry. Alexandria Hospital, though still financially sound at the time, began considering merger options, including both not-for-profit and for-profit partners.
Ultimately, the hospital decided in 1996 to merge with its Fairfax County-based competitor Inova Health System, which was the largest not-for-profit hospital network in Virginia at the time. In addition to concerns about insurance providers, the hospitals' leaders said they expected to save money by avoiding duplication of services. Upon the merger in 1997, the hospital adopted its current name of Inova Alexandria Hospital, and remains a nonprofit organization.

Prostitution in Impressionist painting

Prostitution in Impressionist painting was a common subject in the art of the period. Prostitution was a very widespread phenomenon in nineteenth-century Paris and although an accepted practice among the nineteenth century bourgeoisie, it was nevertheless a topic that remained largely taboo in polite society. As a result, Impressionist works depicting the prostitute often became the subject of scandal, and particularly venomous criticism. Some works showed her with considerable sympathy, while others attempted to impart an agency to her; likewise some work showed high-class courtesans, and others prostitutes awaiting clients on the streets. In addition to the sexual revulsion/attraction the figure of the prostitute stirred, she functioned as a sign of modernity, a clear sign of the entanglement of sex, class, power and money.
"Prostitution, now hidden in the shadows, was for these painters a fact of modernity, and while they drew inspiration from women of the night, they also at times imagined the distance between the studio and the brothel was not so great. Charles Baudelaire, in his early intimate journals, made the equation explicit: 'What is art? Prostitution.'".
Nineteenth-century France.
Prostitution was a part of society and integrated into life in France. The brothels and street walkers were regulated by the state; it was legal in Paris in the nineteenth century and government regulation were placed on brothels. By 1810 Paris alone had 180 government approved brothels. There were bi-weekly inspections of all brothels, which by law were controlled by women. Registering as a prostitute in Paris involved having the woman's real name on a national registry and agreeing to the terms of the bi-weekly medical exams to make sure the prostitutes were not carrying venereal diseases. The bi weekly medical examinations set a standard that was used and spread quickly throughout Europe.
Prostitutes in nineteenth-century Paris were arrested for contravention and malady. Contravention, or breaking the rules, was used as a reason for the arrest of a prostitute when they engaged in anything that went against a government law. Prostitutes could also be arrested if they had a venereal disease. According to scholar Alain Corbin, arresting a prostitute for having a venereal disease served as a way of keeping Paris "clean", both morally and physically. Although the existence of prostitution posed a threat to nineteenth-century Parisian society, it was viewed as a "necessary evil. The view that prostitution was to be tolerated in Paris comes from the belief that it was needed for survival.As a requirement for survival, prostitution helped to "satisfy the needs of men" and prevented infection through the excretion of bodily fluids. 
During the nineteenth century, many women were forced into prostitution. Most scholars have noted that women who were alone in life or abandoned did not have another choice. On the spectrum of prostitution, there were illegal prostitutes, street walkers, legal workers in brothels and courtesans of the bourgeoisie class. The women who were involved in brothels, or walked the street legally or illegally were regulated by the government and subjected to their rules, whereas the courtesans of the upper class were basically ignored by the government. Street walkers (for example those depicted in the film "Les Miserables, ("Directed by Tom Hopper in 2012")", worked impoverished areas to support their family or themselves. According to Robert Schwartz and his students at Mount Holyoke College, these women lead miserable lives and might service hundreds of men for sexual pleasure. Men often attacked brothels, and the majority of these assaults would go undocumented. On the opposite end of the spectrum, courtesans would often be able to choose which men they served and possibly worked as a courtesan as a second job. These women lived pampered lives, and would be able to make choices for themselves. Above all, courtesans were not forced to abide by the laws that street walkers did. A section of brothels that were most well known and considered to be the most expensive were called Maisons de Tolérance. The appearance of these brothels looked like regular living apartments on the outside.
The interest in prostitution became prevalent in French art and culture during this time, with paintings such as Édouard Manet's "Olympia" (1863) and novels such as Émile Zola's "Nana",( 1880) or Alfred de Musset, "Rolla ("1833). Victor Hugo (1802-1885) portrayed 'streetwalkers' in "Les Misérables" (1862) as desperate women forced to sell themselves, women with no options, such as his character Fantine. In Fantine's case, she was forced to turn to prostitution to support herself and her daughter, Cosette, after losing her factory job.
Alexandre Dumas (1824-1895), like many men, was familiar with the world of prostitution. He was in love with a courtesan, a woman named Marie Duplessis, about whom he would go to write a very popular novel, and then a play based on his experience with her called "La Dame aux Camélias", (1848). Men of this time, as stated by Dumas, were born with the need for sexual promiscuity; women were not. He made many claims scorning women of the night.
Charles Baudelaire believed that in many ways the poet resembled a prostitute because they sold their poetry, a part of themselves; to sell their works they were selling themselves. Essentially, the city of Paris revolved around a form of prostitution, consumerism. He believed that no one understood this more than the "flâneur" (an idler or lounger). Baudelaire claimed that prostitution was embedded in Paris and everything involved with it.
Édouard Manet: "Olympia" (1863).
On two occasions, Manet painted works which focused on prostitutes and caused great scandal when exhibited.
According to T.J. Clark, during this time period, the issue of prostitution was brought into the center of society whereas in the past, it had been pushed to the outskirts. The divisions between the outskirts of society and what was acknowledged and accepted were not as clear as they had been. Édouard Manet's (1832-1883) "Olympia" (1863) attracted negative criticism unlike any other painting had before.
Jean Ravenel's described the work as a 
The journalist Bonnin wrote the following in "La France" :"We prefer to think he [Manet] has made a mistake. And what is his aim? His canvases are too unfinished for us possibly to tell".
The work was considered unfinished, like a sketch rather than a real painting.“Olympia” was the name preferred by prostitutes because it referred to La Dona Olympia, the main character of a book by Etienne Delécluze. As Clark notes, the work was found offensive because some people thought she was not a courtesan but a working class prostitute, making her class and place in society definitive and less of an abstract, floating idea. People also did not like this painting because of the lack of skill it seemingly portrayed on Manet's part. They objected particularly to the black outlines and yellowish skin tone present in the painting. Most art historians agree that Manet was challenging the romantic ideals of female nudity and prostitution that were previously held in society. By giving Olympia a completely disinterested expression on her face, the fact that prostitution is a job, unromantic and unenjoyable, for her, is emphasized.
The painting itself was inspired by Titian's (1488-1576) "Venus of Urbino" (1534), but was seen as a crude, badly painted version of its highly esteemed academic predecessor. Many critics chose to ignore the similarities between the two works and viewed them as two totally separate and unrelated paintings.
Edouard Manet: "Nana" (1877).
In 1877, Edouard Manet created the painting "Nana" (1877). Due to its scandalous nature, Manet's painting was not included in the yearly Salon. The inspiration for this painting was the novel "L'Assommoir" (1876) by Émile Zola. The model for Nana was a Parisian, . The painting shows a young, beautiful woman standing in front of a mirror. She is not completely dressed: She is wearing only a short, sleeveless bodice, a slip, silk stockings, and high – heeled shoes. Henriette is in a dressing room called a boudoir and behind her is a settee. A gentlemen caller is seated behind her in a top hat, staring at her as she is turned to face the audience.
Manet's painting of the courtesan created much controversy at the time. Society believed prostitutes to be submissive and weak. Nana's gaze challenged this notion. Just like in Manet's "Olympia", she is staring back at the audience, challenging them. According to Billie Wei, the reversal of gender roles helped to make the painting so controversial. Wei also notes that Manet gives Nana power by painting her surroundings as an "extensions of her corporal being". Wei mentions how "the mirror faces her, the sofa's golden frame curves in parallel with the gentle roundness of her belly, and the blue of the painting behind her echoes the blue of her bodice." The fact that she is at the center of the painting gives her more authority as she is the main character, the protagonist. This feature was scandalous. The fact that the prostitute has more power is made evident in the way the male figure is turned sideways, with only half of his body visible, giving him less significance in the piece.
Edgar Degas: Brothel Monotypes and other works.
Edgar Degas's initial interest in prostitutes, in the years 1876–1890, started with his interest in Edmond de Goncourt's novel "La Fille Elisa" (1877). In 1876–77, Degas filled a sketchbook with illustrations from de Goncourt's novel depicting scenes of a girl who becomes a prostitute with her soldier lover. Following soon after, Degas began illustrating the monotypes of brothel scenes, drawing the same physical type as the illustrations in his sketchbook. Although Degas drew individual prostitutes in a notebook, his actual monotypes were entire brothel scenes. 
Several scholars have tried to identify a literary source of Degas' fifty-some brothel monotypes, but none have found a direct connection. However, there have been parallels to Huysman's "Marthe, histoire d'une fille" (1876), and in Émile Zola's "Nana" (1880). Although the prostitution themes of the novels and of Degas' monotypes have similarities, there is a difference between the treatment of the subject; while Degas' prostitutes are "earthy, ugly creatures", the novelists tend to depict their prostitutes as more "heroic and noble".
One of the more recently notable exhibitions that displayed several of Degas' monotypes was the Museum of Modern Art's "Edgar Degas: A Strange New Beauty" in 2016. "The exhibition includes approximately 120 rarely seen monotypes—along with some 60 related paintings, drawings, pastels, sketchbooks, and prints—that show Degas at his most modern, capturing the spirit of urban life; depicting the body in new and daring ways; liberating mark-making from tradition; and boldly engaging the possibilities of abstraction." One of the works that was displayed in the exhibit, "After the Bath III" (1891–92), is a lithograph that illustrates a woman stepping out of a bath, similar to the .
Critics have tried to interpret Degas' scenes involving prostitutes and understand them. On one hand, many argue that, "rather than being victims of an intrusive gaze or performers in a sexual economy, the women depicted in Degas' [bathing] works are simply alone and unobserved. The works... are depicted from a perspective, but that perspective is not relevant to the fictional content of the work". In other words, Degas "did not exhibit the customary male dominance and instead created images of women who are involved with their own bodies without regard for a male viewer". Female art critics that wrote about this and argued for this include Carol Armstrong, Norma Broude, Wendy Lesser and Eunice Lipton. On the contrary, authors such as Anthea Callen, Hollis Clayson and Heather Dawkins argue that Degas "embodied the dominant masculinity of his era". Specifically, Anthea Callen has argued that "all of Degas' "Bathers" imply a notional "keyhole" viewpoint such that the works become inscribed with the gaze of a male voyeur. Even in works that are structured so as to provide multiple perspectives or unusual angles on the principal subject in a way that calls into question the embodied viewpoint of a fictional observer, Callen suggests that the 'discursive significance' of such a point of view remains pivotal in understanding the works' sexual and social implications. For Callen, even though the works are not set up pornographically, the implied gaze of a male spectator intrudes on the scene and becomes central to comprehension of the works' content by the viewer." 
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec: "Elles" and other works.
Toulouse Lautrec was known for his famous paintings of prostitutes. He visited the Moulin Rouge and other cabarets in the district of Montmartre in Paris. He began by just sketching the women but then as time progressed, Lautrec started painting them as well. His paintings were more of a documentary of the life of these woman rather than objectifying them. "La Toilette" (1889) depicts a woman, probably a prostitute, sitting on the floor, surrounded by sheets who has either just finished bathing or is about to start. In "The Sofa" (1896) Lautrec shows two prostitutes resting on the couch; they are both wearing slips and look exhausted. This could show that they just finished working for a client, or that they are taking breaks between jobs."The Medical Inspection" (1894) is a painting that depicts a reality many prostitutes faced; the dreaded medical inspections. Sexually transmitted diseases were common during this time because of the lack of contraceptives and knowledge about the results of unprotected sex. Toulouse Lautrec captured this phenomenon perfectly; he does not glamorize their profession. The two women are standing with their dresses pulled up as if they know what they are about to experience.

Garbage can model

The garbage can model (also known as garbage can process, or garbage can theory) describes the chaotic reality of organizational decision making in an organized anarchy. The model originated in the 1972 seminal paper, "A Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice", written by Michael D. Cohen, James G. March, and Johan P. Olsen.
Organized anarchies are organizations, or decision situations (also known as choice opportunities), characterized by problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fluid participation. While some organizations (such as public, educational, and illegitimate organizations) are more frequently characterized by these traits of organized anarchy, the traits can be partially descriptive of any organization, part of the time.
Within this context, of an organized anarchy view of organizational decision making, the garbage can model symbolizes the choice-opportunity/decision-situation (for example: a meeting where ideas are discussed and decided on) as a "garbage can" that participants are chaotically dumping problems and solutions into, as they are being generated. The "garbage can" term's significance is best understood by considering the manner in which items in a trash can are organized, which is a messy, chaotic mix. The model portrays problems, solutions, and participants/decision-makers as three independent "streams" that are each generated separately, and flow disconnected from each other. These three streams only meet when the fourth stream of choice opportunity arises, as a garbage can, for the streams to flow into. The mix of garbage (streams) in a single can (choice opportunity) depends on the mix of cans available, on the labels attached to each can, and on what garbage is currently being generated. The mix of garbage in a single can also depend on the speed at which the garbage is collected and removed from the scene, for example, how long before problems, solutions, and/or participants move on to other choice opportunities, or, depending on how long the current choice opportunity remains available. This anarchic view of decision making contrasts with traditional decision theory.
Organized anarchy.
Organized anarchies can be characterized by a sense of chaos and dynamism. Problems and solutions are loosely coupled. Proposed solutions change during bargaining. All participants involved do not get the chance to fully participate, and have limitations on their time and energy. Many things happen at once, all competing with each other for attention. Amongst the confusion, participants try to make sense of their role in the organization.
General properties.
The behavioral theory of organized anarchy views organizations, and/or decision-situations/choice-opportunities, as generally characterized by the three properties of problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fluid participation (detailed below). These properties of organized anarchy are characteristic of any organization in part, part of the time.
Problematic preferences.
The organization has no clear preference or guidelines. It operates on the basis of a variety of inconsistent and ill-defined preferences, goals, and identities. The organization can be described more accurately as a loose collection of ideas, rather than as a coherent structure. Organizations discover their preferences through actions, more than actions are taken on the basis of preferences. It is unclear which problems matter, and which do not.
Unclear technology.
The organization's processes are not understood by the organization's own members. The organization operates based on trial and error procedures, learning from accidents of past experiences, and pragmatic inventions of necessity. It is not clear what the consequences are for proposed solutions, or how to solve problems with solutions that lack evidence.
Fluid participation.
Participants vary in how much time and effort they commit to different domains. Participant involvement also varies, depending on the time. Consequently, the boundaries of the organization are continuously uncertain and changing. Audiences and decision makers for any type of choice change suddenly and unpredictably.
Meaning making.
Organizations can be viewed as vehicles for solving problems, or structures where conflict is resolved through bargaining. However, organizations also provide procedures through which participants gain an understanding of what they are doing and what they have done. Organizations, especially organized anarchies, may have difficulty creating their collective platform and identity. In situations of ambiguity, decision making moves away from ideas of reality, causality, and intentionality, to thoughts of meaning. Therefore, decisions become seen as vehicles for constructing meaningful interpretations of fundamentally confusing worlds, instead of outcomes produced by comprehensible environments. As the complexity of decision situations increase so that they more closely resemble reality, they become meaning generators instead of consequence generators. 
Hence, we understand organized anarchies as meaning makers that we need within organizations so that we can feel like we have reasons and identities for which to be present at the organization and to address many types of concerns, such as in meetings, where the issues may or may not be relevant to the existing topic of discussion. Within this perspective, an organization is a collection of choices seeking problems, issues and feelings seeking decision situations where they can be raised, solutions seeking issues to which they may be able to solve, and decision makers seeking out work.
The Garbage Can Model.
Whereas the theory of organized anarchy provided a larger view to describe how organizations and decision situations function, the garbage can model focuses in on how decisions get made within these organized anarchies. The model details what elements are involved in the decision making process, how the outcomes are generated, and who/what is able to access this interaction.
Decision streams.
The garbage can model views decisions as outcomes of four independent streams (detailed below) within organizations. Prior to the garbage can model, the decision process was imagined very differently, as visually displayed, based on references from the foundational literature, in the figures below.
Problems.
Problems arise from people both inside and outside of the organization, and for many different reasons, all consuming attention. Examples may include family, career, distribution of status and money, or even current events in the media. These problems do not need to be real, or actually important, but only to be perceived as such by the decision makers.
Solutions.
Solutions are an individual's or a collective's product. Examples may include ideas, bills, programs, and operating procedures. None of the solutions need to pertain to an existing problem. Instead, participants use the solutions generated to actively seek out problems that the solutions may be able to solve.
Participants.
Participants have other demands on their time, and actively arrive to, and leave from, the decision making process. They may also have different preferences for different solutions.
Choice opportunities.
Choice opportunities give the organizations chances to act in ways that can be called decisions. These opportunities occur regularly, and organizations are able to determine moments for choice. Examples may include the signing of contracts, hiring and firing employees, spending money, and assigning tasks.
The first three streams of problems, solutions, and participants, flow into the fourth stream of choice opportunities, and mix based on chance, timing, and who happens to be present.
The decision arena.
While the first three streams of problems, solutions, and participants, meet in the stream of choice opportunity (for example, a choice to hire a new employee), the decision/choice arena is the larger domain where all four of these streams meet. This arena can be the type of organization (government, school, university) or the greater setting in which this interaction is occurring. For example, a board or committee may be a choice arena, while the committee's annual elections may be a choice opportunity. Choice opportunities may also move between different choice arenas, such as a decision being passed between committees, or departments.
Decision outcomes.
The outcomes of how the four streams mix in a choice arena can vary. Sometimes decisions are made. Other times no decisions are made. Still other times, decisions are made, but do not address the problem that they were meant to solve.
Resolution.
Resolution occurs when the choices taken resolve the problem that was being addressed. This success occurs when problems arise in choice opportunities, and the decision makers present have the energy/ability to properly address the problems' demands.
Oversight.
Oversight occurs when a decision is taken before the problem reaches it. This happens when choice opportunities arrive and no problems are attached to them. This may be due to problems being attached to other choice arenas at the moment. If there is sufficient energy available to make a choice quickly, participants will make the choice and move on before the relevant problem arrives.
Flight.
Flight occurs when a decision is taken after the problem goes away. This happens when problems are attached to choice opportunities for a period of time and exceed the energy of their respective decision makers to stay focused on the problem. The original problem may then move to another choice arena. Examples are tabling, or sending decisions to subcommittees, where the problems may not get attached to solutions.
Early implications.
The Fortran model simulations, used in the original paper, found that, most often, decisions are not made to resolve problems. Decision making processes were found to be very sensitive to variations in energy and time. Decision makers and problems were also found to seek each other out, and continue to find each other.
Three key aspects of the efficiency of the decision process are problem activity, problem latency, and decision time. Problem activity is the amount of time unresolved problems are actively attached to choice situations. This is a rough measure of the potential for decision conflict in an organization. Problem latency is the amount of time problems spend activated but not linked to choices. Decision time is the persistence of choices. Good organizational structures would be assumed to keep problem activity and problem latency low by quickly solving problems with choices. Notably, this result was not observed in the garbage can model.
The model's processes are very interactive, and some phenomena are dependent on specific combinations of other structures at play. Important problems were found more likely to be solved than unimportant ones, and important choices were less likely to solve problems than unimportant ones.
Model constraints.
Access structures and deadlines provide limitations on what can enter into the garbage can model's processes.
Access Structure.
Access structures are the social boundaries that influence which persons, problems, and solutions are allowed access to the choice arena.
Unrestricted/democratic access.
The loosest access structure, unrestricted/democratic access allows all problems, solutions, and people to enter. Any active problem has access to any active choice. This creates more energy, but also permits problems, solutions, and participants to interfere with each other. Conflict and time devoted to problems (anarchy) are increased. An example could be an open forum, town hall, or general body meeting.
Hierarchical access.
Hierarchical access gives priority entry to important actors, problems, and solutions. Both choices and problems are arranged in a hierarchy so that important problems (having low numbers) have access to many choices, and
important choices (also having low numbers) are accessible to only important
problems. An example could be making big decisions in an executive
meeting/committee, while small decisions are left for the general population. 
Specialized access.
Specialized access happens when only special problems and solutions can gain entry to certain meetings. Specific specialists have access to specific choices that fit their expertise. Each problem has access to only one choice and each choice is accessible to only two problems. Hence, choices specialize in the types of problems that can be connected to them. An example could be computer specialists in a technology committee addressing technical issues.
Deadlines.
Deadlines characterize temporal boundaries, the timing of decision arenas and what flows access them. Constraints include arrival times of problems (seasonal or weather issues, such as a heat wave, or a blizzard), solutions (time delayed, for example by 1 or 5 year plans), participants (determined by the timing of business days, school semesters, etc.), and choice opportunities (for example, meetings based on budget cycles, or student admissions).
Decisions arise from the constraints of access structures and deadlines interacting with the time-dependent flows of problems, solutions, and participants.
Origins of the garbage can model.
While still a doctoral student at the University of Bergen in Norway, Johan P. Olsen came to the University of California, Irvine as a visiting scholar from 1968–1969. At that time, James G. March was both the Dean of the School of Social Sciences (1964–1969), and a professor of psychology and sociology at the University of California, Irvine (1964–1970). Coinciding with the time of Olsen's visit, and March's last year serving as a dean, Michael D. Cohen was a doctoral student at the University of California, Irvine, and was just beginning his work as a research assistant to March. All three scholars were present at the right time, to witness the university conduct a search process to hire a new dean. Ultimately, the search process ended with none of the potential candidates being chosen, and the head of the search committee taking the position of dean. During an interview, Olsen describes the chaotic decision-making process that he observed at the university throughout this search process, and how it served as a foundational experience for the three scholars to later collaborate and produce their model. Olsen explains in this interview how topics previously considered to be important to the decision making process, such as if the actors were reasonable or rational, actually proved to be less important, and were instead trumped by issues such as time constraints of the participants involved. An example provided was a professor being present in one meeting, only to be absent from the following meeting due to professional travel commitments, which can be common for university faculty. This prompted Olsen to consider a contextual model of decision making, one that examined the ability to make calculations and implement them, as opposed to models that focused on motivation. Olsen observed decision makers give each other head nods, and other non-verbal communication, in meetings, and noted the possible communication, or miscommunication this may have entailed. Olsen also highlighted how the search committee's decision-making process was affected by misinterpreting the silence of the current dean (March) regarding applicants as a sign for lack of support, when in fact this was not an accurate interpretation of the dean's preferences. Olsen, therefore, gained an interest to examine collective, as opposed to individual, decision making, and how routines and chance may affect the decision-making process. All of these factors would lead into the development of the garbage can model.
By 1972, March, Cohen, and Olsen had all found their way from the University of California, Irvine to Stanford University, in the positions of professor, post-doctoral fellow, and visiting professor, respectively. That year, they published the seminal paper "A Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice." In this paper, the authors used version 5 of the programming language Fortran to translate their ideas into a computer simulation model of a garbage can decision making process.
Practical applications.
The model enables choices to be made and problems resolved, even when an organization may be plagued by conflict, goal ambiguity, poorly understood problems that come and go, variable environments, and distracted decision makers. There are many situations where the garbage can process of decision making cannot be eliminated, and in some of these instances, such as research, or family, the garbage can process should not be eliminated.
Knowing the characteristics of an organizational anarchy and a garbage can model can help people to properly identify when and where these phenomena exist, and approach them strategically. Understanding how these decision arenas operate provide tools to successfully manage what could otherwise be a problematic decision-making process.
Management styles.
Organized anarchies can be managed, to use the garbage can model to your advantage. Three different management styles can be used, as detailed below.
Reformer.
A reformer eliminates the chaotic garbage can elements from decisions. This creates greater order and control, which centralizes and rationalizes the organization.
Enthusiast.
In contrast to the reformer, the enthusiast tries to discover a new vision of the decision making within garbage can processes. The enthusiast realizes that the planning is in large part symbolic, and is an excuse for participants to interact and generate meaning. It allows participants to feel a sense of belonging, and to learn about identities and views. Once the enthusiast understands that the decision arena is more for sense-making and observations, than for making decisions, temporal sorting can be used as a way to organize attention. The temporal order of topics presented can suggest what is of more concern for collective discussion. Flows of problems and solutions are viewed as a matching market, where energies and connections are mobilized. Assessing who is present, and where time and energy are sufficient, allows the enthusiasts to advance their case most effectively. Characteristics of the garbage can model that were seen by others as disadvantages, such as flexible implementation, uncoordinated action, and confusion, are viewed as advantages by the enthusiast.
Pragmatist.
The pragmatist tries to exploit the anarchy inherent in the garbage can processes to further personal agendas. Timing can be manipulated to have solutions arrive when attention is low. The meeting can be arranged in an order that is personally favorable, where items that are desired to be discussed are placed at the top of the agenda, and items that need to be passed, in which discussion is not desired, are placed at the bottom of the agenda, so that the decision can be rushed through when there is not enough time for discussion. The pragmatist pays attention to fluctuations in interests and participant involvement, so that when certain individuals are not present, it can be easier to advance issues and solutions that may have otherwise been opposed by different participants. Initiatives that are entangled with other streams can be abandoned, and if an unfavorable topic arises, the system can be overloaded to protect the pragmatist's interests. This can be accomplished by bringing up different problems and solutions, which will slow the decision making process down and make it more complex. Other choice opportunities (meetings) can also be proposed to lure problems and participants away from choices that are of interest, in the process gaining time for the pragmatists to address the issues of their concern.
Multi-disciplinary impact.
The garbage can model can be especially helpful in explaining all types of meetings where problems and solutions are fluidly discussed. The model fits well with almost any decentralized social system attempting to address issues, and the model is continuously finding its way into new domains. For example, across a sample of firms involved in hydrocarbon megaprojects, researchers found that problems given the most attention are different from those responsible for budget overruns, and that the attribution of reasons for these overruns differ between project owners and supply chain firms. These inconsistencies are addressed by the garbage can model. Also, trade fairs have been found to be organizational forms that have permeable, fluid participation, and diversified and spontaneous in terms of individual goals and actions, once again displaying traits characteristic of the model.
Several fields such as higher education, the policy-government world, and academic research, are discussed further below.
Higher education.
The American college or university is, in a way, a prototypical organized anarchy. Students constantly enter and leave the institution, and the faculty and staff working there for longer periods of time may have many competing demands on their attention and resources, such as course instruction, research, and conference travel. Different academic departments may prioritize different, and even competing, goals for the university. University senates, in particular, provide an opportunity to see the characteristics of organized anarchy and the garbage can model in action. These senates largely serve symbolic meaning making functions for participants to express themselves through their membership, commitment to professional values, and maintaining relationships. Often, committees that report to the senate take so long to work on their issue, due to constraints on participant time, or difficulty matching problems with solutions, that by the time the committee produces anything, the issue has already passed on. Hence, this provides an example for how the decision was already made, by the garbage can model's decision outcome of flight, where decisions are taken after problems have already gone away. The university senate is known for this latency.
Public policy.
Government can be viewed as an organized anarchy. The actors (politicians) can consistently change with election cycles. There are multiple, often competing, preferences. Problems arise from current events, and can gain or lose focus based on media coverage. Policies may be proposed by think tanks or lobby groups, but these policies may not gain attention until the right situation arises that promotes their relevance. John W. Kingdon built on the ideas of organized anarchy to examine these dynamics in his "Multiple Streams Approach", adapted for the field of public policy Kingdon renamed some of the terms familiar in the garbage can model. Problems remain termed as problems, but solutions became renamed as policies, and participants were termed as politics. These streams converge, or, as Kingdon says, couple, in the policy window (choice opportunity). Ambiguity, competition, an imperfect selection process, actors having limited time, and decision-making processes being neither "comprehensively rational" nor linear, are several key elements of multiple streams approach that clearly reflect the general properties of organized anarchy.
Research in psychology.
The research process in the field of social sciences, particularly in psychology, can be interpreted as an organized anarchy. The academic field of psychology is much more a loose collection of ideas and theories, rather than a coherent structure with a shared intellectual paradigm. Technologies used to conduct research may not be fully understood. Methods for analyzing data, or conducting research, are taken from other fields when the need arises. Participation in the research process is fluid, with some research being done by students, other research being done by professors who may publish one or a few articles and then not continue as a researcher, and other research being done by people who make the research process their life-long profession. Joanne Martin recognized these characteristics of organized anarchy, and applied an adapted version of the garbage can model to the psychological research process. Martin's model restyled the original model's four streams. Problems took the parameters of theoretical problems. Solutions were seen as the results of the research process. Choice opportunities were understood as the selection of which methodology to use for the research. Finally, the stream for participants was re-termed resources, to reflect that, unlike in organizational decision making, not only were actors required to move the decision/research process forward, but specific intellects and skill-sets could also be required, as well as financing, study subjects, and access to certain environments for conducting the research in. The garbage can model of the psychological research process describes how and why some research topics may go unaddressed, certain theoretical problems may be linked with only a single methodological approach, researchers may continue to work on the same issues throughout their careers, some methods may be seldom applied, and how and why the field may appear to make little progress at times.
Current use and future growth of the model.
The garbage can model continues to appear in academic articles, textbooks, and the press, being applied across many diverse domains. Features of organized anarchy have increased in modern times, and many attempts have been made to contribute to the theoretical discourse of the garbage can model by extending it to include new components. For example, fluid participation, a key characteristic of organized anarchy, has greatly increased since the original model was formulated. Some recent research has sought to contribute to the theoretical discourse of the model, by finding leadership style to be a key predictor of decision structure in organized anarchy. Other recent research has found problems with the computer simulation model used in the original article by Cohen, March, and Olsen, suggesting that decision making styles have not been sufficiently analyzed.
In 2012, the volume "The Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice: Looking Forward at Forty" was published, containing a collection of papers celebrating 40 years since the original article on the garbage can model was introduced. The papers collected in the volume present theories of organizational decision processes that build on the original garbage can model, at times adding new ideas to create a hybrid extension of the original, and at other times perhaps violating the original model's core assumptions, thereby proposing alternatives to the existing model. Some of these papers attempt to attach elements of economic reasoning based on rational action assumptions onto the model. Many of the volume's chapters address the problem of agency, to which the garbage can model offered a solution based on a temporal, instead of a consequential, ordering of organizational events. Some of the newer models that have been proposed make assumptions returning to a consequential view of decision making, as well as assuming that individual preferences may play a larger role in the process.
The volume's papers collectively suggest that the next logical stage of evolution for the garbage can model may be to directly model complex network dependencies linking participants, solutions, problems, and choice opportunities, or overall, social processes, within organizations. Taken as a whole, the volume contributes to defining an intellectual agenda that may well extend far beyond the next forty years of organizational research.

M. J. Stewart

Marvin Stewart Jr. (born September 16, 1995) is an American football safety for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at North Carolina. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft.
College career.
During his sophomore season, Stewart was suspended from the team due to a violation of team rules, along with teammate Mike Hughes. He was later charged with misdemeanor assault and battery, but charges were later dropped. Stewart was reinstated less than a week later. There was speculation that Stewart would forgo his senior year and declare for the 2017 NFL draft, but he later announced that he would return for the 2017 season. Following his senior season, Stewart was named to the First Team All-ACC by Pro Football Focus.
Professional career.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Stewart in the second round (53rd overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. Stewart was the fifth cornerback drafted in 2018.
On May 10, 2018, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Stewart to a four-year, $5.08 million contract that includes $2.48 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $1.77 million.
Throughout training camp, Stewart competed to be a starting cornerback against Ryan Smith, Vernon Hargreaves, and Carlton Davis. Head coach Dirk Koetter named Stewart the fifth cornerback on the depth chart to start the regular season, behind Brent Grimes, Vernon Hargreaves, Carlton Davis, and Ryan Smith.
He made his professional regular season debut in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ season-opener at the New Orleans Saints and recorded four solo tackles during their 48-40 victory. The following week, he earned his first career start after Vernon Hargreaves sustained a shoulder injury the previous week and was placed on injured reserve. Stewart finished the Buccaneers’ 27-21 win against the Philadelphia Eagles with five combined tackles. In a Week 3, Stewart collected a season-high nine solo tackles and broke up a pass attempt during a 30-27 loss against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Stewart was inactive for five games (Weeks 9-13) after injuring his foot. Stewart lost his role as a starting cornerback to Ryan Smith during his absence and remained a backup for the last four games of the season. Stewart finished his rookie season in 2018 with 33 combined tackles (31 solo) and three pass deflections in 11 games and five starts.
On August 6, 2020, Stewart was waived by the Buccaneers.
Cleveland Browns.
Stewart was claimed off waivers by the Cleveland Browns on August 8, 2020.
In Week 4 against the Dallas Cowboys, Stewart recorded his first career sack on Dak Prescott during the 49–38 win. 
In Week 13 against the Tennessee Titans, Stewart recorded his first career interception off a pass thrown by Ryan Tannehill during the 41–35 win. 
In the Wild Card round of the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Stewart led the team with 10 tackles and intercepted a pass thrown by Ben Roethlisberger during the 48–37 win.

Jagged Little Pill (musical)

Jagged Little Pill is a rock musical with music by Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard, lyrics by Morissette, and book by Diablo Cody, with additional music by Michael Farrell and Guy Sigsworth. The musical is inspired by the 1995 album of the same name by Morissette and deals with pain, healing, and empowerment. It premiered at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 5, 2018, directed by Diane Paulus.
The show began previews on Broadway in November 2019, and opened on December 5, 2019. For the 74th Tony Awards, "Jagged Little Pill" received 15 nominations, the most of any show of the 2019–2020 season. It also won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.
Background.
In November 2013, it was revealed that a musical version of the album "Jagged Little Pill" by Alanis Morissette was being adapted for the stage with composer Tom Kitt attached to arrange the orchestrations. A first workshop was expected to take place in 2014, however in 2015 Morissette revealed that the show was still in the early stages and had yet to be written. In May 2017, it was announced that the musical would receive its world premiere in May 2018, 23 years after the album was released. A reading took place in 2017, with Idina Menzel taking the part of Mary Jane. The first public performance of songs from the show took place in March 2018, at the American Repertory Theater Gala.
The show has a book by Diablo Cody, with direction by Diane Paulus, choreography by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, set design by Riccardo Hernandez, costume design by Emily Rebholz, lighting design by Justin Townsend, and video design by Finn Ross. Music and lyrics are by Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard, with musical direction by Bryan Perri, sound design by Jonathan Deans and orchestration by Tom Kitt. In addition to music from the show's namesake album, "Jagged Little Pill" also features other songs from Morissette's catalog, including "Thank U", "That I Would Be Good", and "So Pure" from 1998's "Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie", "So Unsexy" and "Hands Clean" from 2002's "Under Rug Swept", "Unprodigal Daughter" from 2002's "Feast on Scraps", "No" from the Japanese edition of 2012's "Havoc and Bright Lights" and "Uninvited" from the soundtrack of the 1998 film "City of Angels." Morissette also wrote two new songs for the musical, "Smiling" and "Predator", with the former being included as the second single from her ninth studio album "Such Pretty Forks in the Road".
Plot summary.
Act I
Mary Jane (MJ) Healy is a mother writing the yearly family Christmas letter. She writes about her husband Steve's job promotion, her daughter Frankie's art, and her son Nick's early admission to Harvard University. MJ writes that she got into a car crash, but is healing with the help of natural remedies. What she doesn't write is that Steve is addicted to pornography, Frankie is making out with her best friend, Jo, as the letter is being written, and MJ is addicted to the painkillers from the car accident ("Right Through You"). MJ pressures Nick to be perfect to keep up the family's image ("All I Really Want"). At school, Frankie and Jo discuss how their mothers don't understand or accept them: Frankie's because of her disapproval of her self expression and Jo's mom not accepting them being gay or their gender expression ("Hand in My Pocket").
MJ tries to get drugs from the pharmacy, but she is out of refills. MJ moves through her day backwards, starting with getting her painkillers in the alley, doing her daily activities, and ending with her running out of the pills at the beginning of the day ("Smiling"). On the last day of Frankie's English class before winter break, she reads a short story she wrote aloud in a writer's workshop for her class to critique. The students in the class criticize her since things she claims to be ironic in her piece are not actually ironic, just bad things that happened to someone. A new student, Phoenix, defends Frankie and encourages her to finish ("Ironic"). A romantic attraction begins between the two. After class, Phoenix and Frankie decide to go to a party that night. At home, MJ and Steve get into an argument. Steve says he wants to see a marriage counselor, yet MJ refuses ("So Unsexy"). Nick comforts MJ after the fight. MJ claims that Nick is the only thing that she has ever done right. Nick reflects on the pressures of him from his mother to be perfect ("Perfect").
Frankie and Nick go to the party ("Lancer's Party (So Pure)"). Frankie and Phoenix find each other and leave the crowded party to talk alone, and they discuss their imperfect family lives. Meanwhile, Jo doesn't attend the party because their mom forced them to go to a church function. Jo's mom scolds them for not dressing femininely enough ("That I Would Be Good"). The next morning, Jo shows Frankie pictures that are circulating throughout the school of Bella, Nick's friend, who was drunk, passed out, and had her shirt pulled up at the party. Students are making fun of Bella and calling her a slut. Frankie and Jo go to Bella's house, despite barely knowing her, to check on her. Bella reveals that Andrew, Nick's best friend, was the one who took the pictures and raped her. Frankie goes home and wakes Nick up to reprimand him about not going to the police because he was the only one who saw how drunk Bella was. Nick brushes off Bella's claim, saying that Bella was being dramatic per usual. MJ overhears the conversation and insists that Nick should not come forward as it might ruin his reputation. MJ blames Bella for what happened since she chose to drink, but she is visibly upset by the story ("Wake Up"). MJ walks to the church for the first time in a while to pray about her failing marriage, struggling relationship with Frankie, and for help with her addiction. She then reflects on her own memory of being raped in college, but blames herself and feels it was God's plan for her ("Forgiven").
Act II
Steve and MJ go to their first marriage counseling session, despite MJ's reluctance ("Not the Doctor"). Meanwhile, Frankie and Phoenix hang out at a playground and end up sleeping together ("Head over Feet"). Jo enters the Healys' house uninvited ("Your House") and walks in on Frankie and Phoenix. Jo gets mad and storms out of Frankie's room. MJ and Steve come home early and Jo tells them that Frankie and Phoenix had sex. Phoenix leaves quickly, leaving Frankie alone with her parents. MJ and Steve reprimand her for having sex so young. Frankie comes out to her parents as bisexual, and she gets mad at her parents for disapproving of her consensual sex but not caring about Bella's rape. Frankie runs away to New York City. Steve and MJ fight about Steve not being present during Frankie's childhood. Frankie takes a train alone to New York ("Unprodigal Daughter"). When she gets lost in the city, Frankie calls Phoenix. She tells him that she loves him and that he should come pick her up. When Phoenix doesn't say 'I love you' back and that he needs to stay at home to help his sister with a medical condition, Frankie gets angry and feels that Phoenix used her for her body.
Students are gossiping about Bella and her accusations against Andrew. Bella comes to the Healys' house to talk to Nick, but the only person home is MJ. MJ tries to comfort Bella by telling her she was also raped in college. Bella asks MJ when she started to feel better after her rape, but MJ doesn't answer. Bella leaves realizing that it may never get better. Nick comes clean to MJ, telling her that he walked in on Andrew raping an unconscious Bella, but he did nothing and left ("Predator"). Nick says he wants to go to the police, but MJ says that it would ruin his life and not help Bella's. Nick accuses her of only caring about herself and her reputation, and not about Bella. MJ hits him. Jo comes to New York to pick up Frankie after she calls them out of desperation, lost and out of money. Frankie shows little remorse for sleeping with Phoenix since she didn't think her relationship with Jo was exclusive. She tells Jo that she is in love with Phoenix. Jo ends the relationship ("You Oughta Know"). At home, MJ overdoses on pills. Steve and Nick find her unconscious ("Uninvited"). When Steve gets to the hospital, he is devastated that he didn't know MJ had an addiction and promises her he will be there for her and the family from now on ("Mary Jane"). When Nick gets to the hospital, MJ tells him that he should go to the police, but Nick already told the police about what happened to Bella. Meanwhile, many students attend the rally that Frankie organized to get justice for Bella. Bella is mad at Nick since people only believed her once Nick came forward, and her statement wasn't enough ("No").
A year has passes, and MJ is writing the Christmas letter again. She writes about the progress being made in their relationships and lives. MJ tells Frankie that she wanted her to feel like every other kid and not be treated differently because of her race, but Frankie tells her that she wouldn't have wanted to fit in with the people in their town ("Thank U"). Frankie dares MJ to email the Christmas letter to everyone, despite its frankness about her overdose and her dislike of the culture in their town. MJ sends it, deciding that this will be her last Christmas letter. Jo and Frankie rekindle their friendship, and Jo has a new girlfriend. Frankie and Phoenix are now just friends. Frankie and MJ, Bella and Nick, and Bella and MJ all now appear to have mended their relationships ("You Learn").
Productions.
Cambridge (2018).
"Jagged Little Pill" ran from May 5 to July 15, 2018, at the Loeb Drama Center, within the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The cast included Elizabeth Stanley as Mary Jane, Derek Klena as Nick, Lauren Patten as Jo, Sean Allan Krill as Steve and Celia Rose Gooding as Frankie.
Broadway (2019–present).
In January 2019, the producers announced plans to bring the show to Broadway in fall 2019, also directed by Paulus. It began previews at the Broadhurst Theatre on November 3 and opened on December 5, 2019. The production went into hiatus when all Broadway theatres closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Critical reception.
Cambridge production.
"The New York Times" called the Cambridge production "[p]assionate, dramatically compelling, and big-hearted..."Jagged Little Pill" breaks the jukebox musical mold, and takes on the good work we are always asking new musicals to do: the work of singing about "real" things." In a "New York Times" feature story published on May 20, 2018, the show's story, "steeped in hot-button issues like opiate addiction, gender identity and sexual assault", was described as being "very much of the present, and may just be the most woke musical since "Hair"."
Bob Verini of "Variety" wrote, "Not since "Rent" has a musical invested so many bravura roles with so much individual life...It's a risky business, making a musical not from a story demanding to be told but from a set of songs merely available to be used. "Jagged Little Pill" triumphantly avoids the pitfalls. Always engaging, often moving and even rousing, the show boasts dramatic interest and integrity on its own theatrical terms, courtesy of director Diane Paulus, first-time librettist Diablo Cody, and that peerless, soulful balladeer of the modern Western condition, Alanis Morissette."
Broadway.
The Broadway production of "Jagged Little Pill" opened to positive reviews. "The New York Times" described the musical as "redemptive, rousing and real... "Jagged Little Pill" stands alongside the original musicals that have been sustaining the best hopes of Broadway". Praising the show's score, "Variety" wrote, "Morissette’s youthful perspective and the rocking-good score make "Jagged Little Pill" feel very much of the moment". "Rolling Stone" awarded the production four out of five stars, writing that although the show feels "overly 'woke'" at times and "wears its earnestness on its sleeve", "Jagged Little Pill" burns with passion... and enthusiastic beauty." The show was nominated for 15 Tony Awards.
Musical numbers.
All lyrics by Alanis Morissette. All music by Morissette and Glen Ballard, except for "No" (co-composed with Guy Sigworth), "Predator" and "Smiling" (co-composed with Michael Farrell).
Act I
Act II
Recording.
The original Broadway cast recording was released on November 29, 2019. It debuted at number two on the "Billboard" Cast Albums chart, number 14 on the Alternative Album Sales chart, and number 26 on the Rock Album Sales chart. It won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, however, due to the Grammy's rules, Gallagher, Gooding, Patten and Stanley are the only cast members who received the award.
Controversy.
In the original A.R.T. run of the show, Jo was a nonbinary character, played by Lauren Patten, a cisgender woman. On social media, Patten retweeted and posted in support of Jo as a nonbinary character, confirming the use of they/them pronouns for the character and referring to them as non-binary and genderqueer on multiple occasions. There were also multiple references in the show to Jo not being cisgender.
When the show moved to Broadway, the official social media of "Jagged Little Pill" and Patten removed any posts referencing Jo as being non-binary or genderqueer or using they/them pronouns, now referring to the character as a cisgender female. A 2020 interview with Patten quoted her as stating: "Jo never was written as anything other than cis". The show now uses she/her pronouns for Jo rather than they/them.
In April 2021, debate and backlash from the theatre community on social media over the issue was revived, with the switch being seen as another example of the underrepresentation of trans and nonbinary people on Broadway.
On September 17, 2021, the producers behind the show released a statement apologizing for making Jo cisgender and for not listening to feedback. They also posted a plan for future productions, including hiring a new dramaturge to help revise the scripts and casting actors playing Jo who are on their own gender journey.

Just Shapes &amp; Beats

Just Shapes &amp; Beats is an action rhythm video game developed and published by Canadian indie team Berzerk Studio. It was released on May 31, 2018 for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch, February 24, 2019 for macOS and Linux, May 10, 2019 for PlayStation 4 in the US, and May 30, 2019 for PlayStation 4 in Europe, Russia and Australia. It was also released on June 30, 2020 for Stadia. In this game, players move a colorful shape to the beat of background music and dodge pink shapes.
Gameplay.
"Just Shapes &amp; Beats" consists of multiple levels based around individual tracks by independent artists in the Dubstep, Trap music (EDM) and chiptune genres, such as Nitro Fun, Tristam, Noisestorm and Pegboard Nerds.
Up to four players each control one small shape, surviving via dodging a variety of attacks, such as huge beams, bouncing waves, snake-like spirals, and pulsating shapes. These attacks appear and move in rhythm to the music, with difficulty increasing the further players progress.
Being struck by one of these attacks causes the player to lose part of their shape, represented by either a cyan square (default shape for a single player), a yellow triangle, a green pentagon or an orange circle, if there are multiple players. Players can take up to three hits in regular levels and six hits during 'boss battles'. If the shape breaks entirely, the game rewinds to the previous checkpoint, or in the case of the boss battles, back to the start. Three breaks within a single level results in a Game Over screen, with the text stating "It's Over" and the cyan square breaking down to pieces. Tapping Enter (PC/Steam), A (Switch), or the Cross button (PS4) multiple times causes the square to fix itself and changes the screen's text to read "It's NOT Over", allowing the player to continue from the beginning of the level. At the top of the screen a large bar with a white triangle at the end serves as a progress bar for each level.
The game offers multiple modes that feature variations on the basic gameplay, such as party mode, playlist, challenge run, and story mode. Hardcore mode was added in 2019, which adds harder versions of all available levels.
Development.
The first demo of the game was revealed at PAX 2016 and was supposed to be released that summer. During the event, release date was delayed from late 2016 to early 2017. The game was eventually delayed again, with a launch date of summer 2018. On March 20, 2018, it was announced that the game would also receive a release on the Nintendo Switch.
On June 25, 2021, the studio announced that The Lost Chapter will be added to the game on July 23. The update consists of 5 new tracks, including a remix of "Spider Dance" from Undertale.
Reception.
On review aggregator Metacritic, "Just Shapes &amp; Beats" has received 83/100, indicating "generally favorable reviews."

Globe Rowing Club

Globe Rowing Club is a rowing club in Greenwich, an area in the South East of London, England. Established in 1923, the club house and boat house are based on Crane Street in the historic centre of Greenwich, as part of the Trafalgar Rowing Trust. The club uses both the River Thames and the London Regatta Centre at the Royal Docks for water outings, and admits male and female rowers of all ages, but is particularly known for its high performance Junior programme.
History.
The rowing club was originally established at J. Stone &amp; Co's engineering works in Deptford's Arklow Road and was called Stones Rowing Club, with membership restricted to company employees.
In the first years after the club was established, the boats used were heavy Clinker fours, hired from local waterman in East Greenwich and were used mainly on Sunday mornings. This was found to be cost prohibitive and, in time, the club applied to Stone's engineering works for a grant to purchase new equipment. This was refused, and as a result the club broke away from the works and set up independently to attract new members from elsewhere, with headquarters in the nearby Lord Clyde public house (western end of Clyde Street). The club was hence known as the Clyde Rowing Club.
During the mid 1930s, the headquarters were moved to another public house, The Globe on Royal Hill in Greenwich (demolished c. 1938), from which the rowing club took its current name, Globe Rowing Club. The club also had a headquarters (1947) at the nearby Mitre public house in Greenwich; and for a time used a decommissioned landing craft moored opposite the Union Tavern (today The Cutty Sark) at Ballast Quay.
Globe was only the second club in East London after Curlew Rowing Club to hold club regattas, with the earliest taking place shortly after the end of the Second World War, the participants being watermen working on nearby Thames shuttles and barges. The club was also the first rowing club in East London to use an eight.
In August 1981, members of Globe Rowing Club set a Guinness World Record for "The greatest distance for paddling a hand propelled bath tub in 24 hr...by a team of 25" The record distance set was "60 miles 88 yd".
In 2006, Greenwich Council granted permission, with contributions from Sport England, and the Trafalgar 2001 Trust Ltd for the club to develop the facilities on the corner of Crane Street and Eastney Street, creating a heated, lit boathouse, indoor training room and clubhouse known as the Trafalgar Rowing Centre.
In the early 2010s, Globe's Junior section began a partnership with non-profit organisation London Youth Rowing, to bring indoor and water rowing to increase participation in the sport and allow those from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate. Many of the junior members who have gone on to achieve national and international rowing success have done so as a result of the partnership with LYR.
Notable results.
The club has won eight gold medals at the British Rowing Championships. The Junior section of Globe Rowing Club achieved national and international attention in the 2015–2018 quadrennium for a series of national and international medal wins and the unprecedented inclusion of 6 junior globe members in the Great British rowing trial squad.
Notable results include;
2017 Henley Royal Regatta – Globe Junior Men's 4x qualify to the heats of the Fawley Challenge Cup and beat Lea Rowing Club
2017 Coupe de la Jeunesse – Callum Sullivan and Jake Offiler of Globe RC part of the victorious Great British team.
2004 Women's Eights Head of the River – 2nd Place, S4 Category (Small Clubs)
Notable members.
Calum Sullivan – member of the winning Cambridge crew in the Boat Race 2019, member of the winning Cambridge reserve boat crew in the Boat Race 2018, 2017 Coupe de la Jeunesse team member.
In 2017, Globe Junior Julia Olawumi became the first rower from the club to commit to an NCAA Division 1 school for rowing choosing the University of Tulsa in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Red Zone is an out-of-print collectible card game by Donruss and NXT Games. It was first released in October 1995. The game's base set consists of 336 cards sold in 80-card starter decks and 12-card booster packs. An expansion called "1995 Expansion Teams" was released in December 1995 and contained 98 cards and focused on the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars. In early 1996, Donruss sold its sports card and card-game properties to Pinnacle. NXT Games also had to renegotiate their licenses for Red Zone and Top of the Order with the NFL and MLB, but new iterations of the game never materialized.
Gameplay involved a player draft (not to be confused with the drafting format of CCGs) and chose one of eight offensive or defensive plays. Each player would then draw a card and the color denoted on that card would determine the final result of the play. The game was criticized for being "tedious and repetitive, and the actual players you used only rarely made a difference." Once you had players with high ratings there was no reason to use players with lower ratings, except in your play deck.

Catholic Church and same-sex marriage

The Catholic Church has intervened in political discourses to enact legislative and constitutional provisions establishing marriage as the union of a man and a woman, resisting efforts by civil governments to establish either civil unions or same-sex marriage.
Church teaching.
On 3 June 2003, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published "Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions Between Homosexual Persons" opposing same-sex marriage. This document made clear that "legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behaviour... but would also obscure basic values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity."
Catholic legislators were instructed that supporting such recognition would be "gravely immoral," and that they must do all they could to actively oppose it, bearing in mind that "the approval or legalisation of evil is something far different from the toleration of evil". The document said that allowing children to be adopted by people living in homosexual union would actually mean doing violence to them, and stated: "There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God's plan for marriage and family. Marriage is holy, while homosexual acts go against the natural moral law."
In October 2015, bishops attending the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Rome agreed on a final document which reiterated that while homosexuals should not be discriminated against unjustly, the Church was clear that same-sex marriage is "not even remotely analogous" to heterosexual marriage. They also argued that local churches should not face pressure to recognise or support legislation that introduces same-sex marriage, nor should international bodies put conditions on financial aid to developing countries to force the introduction of laws that establish same-sex marriage.
North America.
Canada.
In July 2003, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Canada, the country's plurality religion, protested the Chrétien government's plans to include same-sex couples in civil marriage. The church criticisms were accompanied by Vatican claims that Catholic politicians should vote according to their personal beliefs rather than the policy of the government. In late 2004, Frederick Henry, Bishop of Calgary, wrote a pastoral letter saying "Since homosexuality, adultery, prostitution and pornography undermine the foundations of the family, the basis of society, then the State must use its coercive power to proscribe or curtail them in the interests of the common good."
United States.
In the United States, the leadership of the Catholic Church has taken an active and financial role in political campaigns across all states regarding same-sex marriage. Human Rights Campaign said that the church spent nearly $2 million in 2012 toward unsuccessful campaigns against gay marriage in four states, as the second-largest donor representing a significant share of the contributions used to fund anti-gay marriage campaigns. A 2012 Pew Research Center poll indicated that Catholics in the United States who generally support gay marriage outnumber those who oppose it at 52 percent to 37 percent.
In 2004, George Hugh Niederauer, as Bishop of Salt Lake City, who opposed same-sex marriage, spoke against a proposal to include a ban against it in the Utah state constitution, saying that prohibition by law was sufficient. But in 2008, as Archbishop of San Francisco, he campaigned in favor of California's Proposition 8, a ballot measure to constitutionally recognize heterosexual marriage as the only valid marriage within California. Campaign finance records show he personally gave at least $6,000 to back the voter-approved ban and was instrumental in raising $1.5 million to put the proposition on the ballot. Subsequently, he called for an amendment to the US Constitution as "the only remedy in law against judicial activism" following the striking down of a number of state same-sex marriage bans by federal judges. In 2012, Catholic bishops in Washington state issued pastoral statements and DVDs articulating the Catholic vision of marriage and urging parishioners to support efforts to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman in Referendum 74.
In 2010, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) clarified the criteria for the funding of community development programs by the Catholic Campaign for Human Development. One criterion was exclusion of organizations advancing activities that run counter to Catholic teaching, examples of which included those that support or promote same-sex marriage. In 2016, the President of the national bishops' conference denounced US Vice President Joe Biden for officiating at the wedding of a same-sex couple, arguing that Catholic politicians should only do what is expressly in line with Catholic Church teaching.
Thomas Paprocki, Bishop of Springfield, Illinois, said Catholic politicians who have been involved in making gay marriage legal should not present themselves for Holy Communion until they go to confession. He also said that there should be no Communion for people in a same-sex union. Paprocki and Bishop Robert Morlino of Madison, Wisconsin, have instructed priests not to allow church funerals for those in same-sex marriages or unions to avoid giving the appearance that the Church approved of such unions.
Europe.
Catholic Church figures have also criticized attempts to legalize same-sex marriage in Europe. Pope John Paul II criticized same-sex marriage when it was introduced in the Netherlands in 2001. In Spain and Portugal, Catholic leaders led the opposition to same-sex marriage, urging their followers to vote against it or to refuse to implement the marriages should they become legal. In May 2010, during an official visit to Portugal four days before the ratification of the law, Pope Benedict XVI affirmed his opposition by describing it as "insidious and dangerous."
In 2010 in Ireland, Sean Brady, the Archbishop of Armagh, unsuccessfully asked Irish Catholics to resist government proposals for same-sex civil partnerships, and the Irish episcopal conference said that they discriminated against people in non-sexual relationships. In April 2013, when the legalization of same-sex marriage was being discussed, the Irish Bishops Conference stated in their submission to a constitutional convention that, if the civil definition of marriage was changed to include same-sex marriage, so that it differed from the church's own definition, they could no longer perform civil functions at weddings.
In the predominantly Catholic countries of Italy and Croatia, the Catholic Church has been the main opponent to either the introduction of civil unions or marriage for same-sex-couples. In July 2013, 750,000 petition signatures were collected by the conservative group "In the Name of the Family", strongly supported by Catholic church leaders. This directly led to the 2013 referendum whereby the constitution was amended to state that marriage is only a union between a man and a woman. In February 2016 the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, rejected the Catholic Church's interference in a parliamentary debate to introduce civil unions and adoption rights for same-sex partners. This followed Bagnasco's (Archbishop of Genoa) attempt to get the Italian Senate to carry out a secret ballot in the hope it would make it easier for lawmakers to follow their conscience, rather than the party line. Bagnasco had compared the idea of recognizing same-sex unions directly with state recognition for incest and pedophilia.
Likewise in Slovenia, the Archbishop of Ljubljana, Stanislav Zore, publicly gave his support to establish a referendum vote aimed at changing the country's constitution so that marriage would be defined as being between a man and a woman. The referendum was subsequently passed and the earlier legislative vote to legalise same-sex marriage was nullified. In January 2013, Catholic bishops publicly thanked members of parliament in Poland for voting down a bill which would have permitted same-sex civil partnerships. In response to the legalisation of gay marriage in Austria in 2017, the president of the Austrian bishop's conference, Cardinal Christoph Schönborn denounced the move, arguing that marriage is a male-female relationship intended for "producing, nurturing and raising children, thus ensuring the succession of generations."
South America.
In response to efforts to introduce same-sex marriage in Uruguay in 2013, Pablo Galimberti, the Bishop of Salto, on behalf of the Uruguayan Bishops Council, said that marriage was "an institution that is already so injured" and that the proposed law would "confuse more than clarify". The proposal nevertheless became law, with strong public support.
Africa.
In Cameroon, Victor Tonye Bakot, the Archbishop of Yaounde, reflected a particularly hostile attitude by the Church in Cameroon, with such interventions prompting the national press to allege the existence of a homosexual "mafia" with a witch-hunt against prominent individuals. In 2013 and 2016, the National Episcopal Conference of Cameroon followed this up by issuing a public statement urging "all believers and people of good will" to oppose gay marriage and the decriminalization of homosexuality.
In 2014, the Catholic Bishops Conference in Nigeria welcomed legislation passed by the government to make participation in a same-sex marriage a crime punishable by 14 years imprisonment. It noted the move as a "courageous act" and a "step in the right direction". The Archbishop of Jos, Ignatius Ayau Kaigama, argued that the action was "in line with the moral and ethical values of the Nigerian and African cultures", and blessed President Goodluck Jonathan in not bowing to international pressure. The Catholic church also had a strong opposition against lgbt rights in many Christian majority countries like Kenya, Zambia, Angola, Uganda, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, and the Central African Republic.
Asia.
In the Philippines, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines has been increasingly vocal in its opposition to legal recognition of same-sex relationships, coinciding with a legal challenge to the ban on same-sex marriage in the Family Code being raised in the Philippines Supreme Court. In August 2015, Archbishop Socrates Villegas told Filipino Catholics that they "cannot participate in any way or even attend religious or legal ceremonies that celebrate and legitimize homosexual unions".
In Hong Kong, Cardinal John Tong Hon has used pastoral letters on two occasions to criticise proposals to legislate for same-sex marriage, most recently in 2015. He urged Catholics to consider this when voting in the district council elections. Several pan-democratic parties criticised Tong's remarks.
Australia.
In 2015, the Archbishop of Hobart, Julian Porteous, with the support of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference distributed a booklet to 12,000 families with children in Catholic schools across Tasmania entitled "Don't Mess With Marriage", describing relationships between gay couples as "pretended marriage". Porteous was subsequently referred to the Australian Anti-Discrimination Commissioner. The complaint was withdrawn without a finding.
Several Australian bishops publicly supported the "no" vote in the referendum on gay marriage. In August 2017, Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher argued that religious schools, charities, and hospitals could be coerced to comply with the "new view of marriage" if the majority of Australians opted for a change in legislation, raising fears that teachers would not be free to follow the traditional church teaching on marriage, but instead be forced to teach a more 'politically correct' curriculum. He went on to claim that religious believers would be vulnerable to discrimination suits and could even lose their jobs if same-sex marriage were to be legalised. The Archbishop of Brisbane, Mark Coleridge, also intervened in the referendum debate to say that the state should be allowed to restrict who can marry, such as prohibitions on incest. He said that like love shared between family members, love shared between gay people "is love and it is valuable but it’s not and it can’t be the kind of love that we call marriage."
Civil unions.
There has been some dissent expressed in recent years by senior and notable figures in the Catholic Church on whether support should be given for homosexual civil unions. The insistence of Bishop Jacques Gaillot to preach a message about homosexuality contrary to that of the official church teaching is largely considered to be one of the factors that led to him being removed from his See of Evraux, France, in 1995. While bishop he had blessed a homosexual union in a "service of welcoming", after the couple requested it in view of their imminent death from AIDS.
In his book "Credere e conoscere", published shortly before his death, Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the former Archbishop of Milan, supported civil unions, though stated they could not be considered the equivalent of heterosexual marriages. He also said he understood the need for gay self-affirmation. Cardinal Ruben Salazar Gomez of Bogota and Archbishop Piero Marini have both expressed support for civil unions.
German cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode have both opined that the blessing of same-sex unions would be possible in Catholic churches in Germany. In Austria the blessing of same sex unions are allowed in at least two churches, both located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz.
In the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aachen in Germany, five same-sex unions received a blessing from the local priest in the German town of Mönchengladbach. Additionally, in 2007, one same-sex union received a blessing in the German town of Wetzlar in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg. A blessing of a same-sex union, equivalent to marriage except in name, was made by a Catholic Dominican priest in Malta in 2015. He was not publicly censured by his local bishop.
Cardinal Rainer Woelki, the Archbishop of Berlin, and the Archbishop of Hamburg, Stefan Heße, have both noted the values of fidelity and reliability found in gay relationships. At the 2015 Synod of Bishops in Rome, Cardinal Reinhard Marx urged his fellow bishops that "We must make it clear that we do not only judge people according to their sexual orientation. ... If a same-sex couple are faithful, care for one another and intend to stay together for life God won't say 'All that doesn't interest me, I'm only interested in your sexual orientation. 
Over 260 Catholic theologians, particularly from Germany, Switzerland and Austria, signed in January and February 2011 a memorandum, called "Church 2011", which said that the Church's esteem for marriage and celibacy "does not require the exclusion of people who responsibly live out love, faithfulness, and mutual care in same-sex partnerships or in a remarriage after divorce".
Pope Francis expressed support for same-sex civil unions in a documentary "Francesco" released in October 2020. The pope said that "homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. ... They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it."

Poul Vendelbo Løvenørn

Poul Thomsen Vendelbo de Løvenørn, born Poul Thomsen (5 April 1686 – 27 February 1740) was a Danish military officer, diplomat and landowner. He served as Secretary of War and Minister of the Navy in the 1730s and was the owner of Bregentved Manor.
Early life and education.
He was born at Horsens, the son of farmer Thomas Poulsen Vendelbo (or Windelboe) (died 1693) and wife Anne Nielsdatter (1645-1708). His father died in 1693 and the mother then married customs officer Stephan Jacobsen (1664-1728) in 1694. He studied theology.
Career.
He then travelled to Russia where he initially worked as a teacher and later became adjutant general at the court of Peter the Great.
King Frederick IV raised him to the peerage under the surname Løvenørn on his return to Denmark in 1711. He was promoted through the ranks as a military officer and on 16 April 1722, was created Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. He later served as Danish envoy om Berlin. In 1726, he was appointed to district governor ("amtmand") of Aarhus County.
Løbenørn was appointed to Secretary of War in 1730 and "gehejmeråd" in 1731. In 1733 he was appointed to general. He was a favorite of both King Frederick IV and King Christian VI. He was granted the Order of the Elephant in 1739.
Personal life.
Løvenørn married Ingeborg Dorthea Vinding, (13 June 1686 - 28 January 1734) on 21 March 1714 in Church of Our lady. She was a daughter of professor at the University of Copenhagen Poul Vinding (1658-1712) and Margrethe S. Bøgvad (1660-1721). His wife bore him a son, Frederik de Løvenørn (6 May 1715 - 15 October 1779) who became a military officer and district governor of Kronborg and Antvorskov.
Løvenørn purchased Bregentved Manor on very favorable conditions from the king in 1721. He died on 27 February 1740.
Cultural references.
Ambrosius Stub (1705–1758) wrote the poem "Om Poul Vendelbo Løvenørn" (1740) about Løvenørn on the occasion of his death.
Carl Ploug (1813-1894) wrote a six pages, romantic poem about Løvenørn's early years and first encounter with his wife. The poem, entitled "A Kiss", is included on the anthology "Hovedværker i den danske Literatur" (Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1889).

Al Bramlet

Elmer "Al" Bramlet (February 18, 1917 – February 1977) was a labor union leader. He was the secretary-treasurer of Las Vegas Culinary Workers Local 226 and President of the Nevada AFL-CIO. Bramlet was one of the most powerful figures in Nevada, as he was able to shut down the Las Vegas tourism business through the use of labor strikes. He was murdered in 1977, allegedly because of a dispute over money involving the attempted bombing of two restaurants that Bramlet was trying to unionize.
Early life.
Al Bramlet was born on a farm near Jonesboro, Arkansas. After serving in the United States Navy, he moved to Los Angeles and became a bartender, later serving as a business agent for a bartenders local union. In 1946, he moved to Las Vegas and joined Culinary Workers Union Local 226. In 1954, he became its secretary-treasurer.
Union activities.
Under Bramlet's leadership, the Culinary Workers Union Local grew from 1,500 members to 22,000 at the time of his death. Bramlet was known for his aggressive efforts in organizing workers. In 1958, he tried to get the owner of the Alpine Village Restaurant to let the workers unionize. When the owner refused, the union picketed the restaurant for almost twenty years.
The Culinary Workers Union initiated a strike against Downtown Las Vegas hotel-casino owners in 1967, which closed 12 hotels and lasted for six days. A strike against hotels on the Las Vegas Strip in 1970 lasted for four days. In 1976, the Culinary Workers Union, along with three other unions, held a strike lasting 15 days against 15 large hotel-casinos in Las Vegas. Twelve of the hotel-casinos closed down during the strike.
Bramlet had various disputes with the parent union, Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE), which had connections with the Chicago Outfit. Edward T. Hanley, president of HERE, tried to get control of the local's union health and welfare funds. The Chicago Outfit's enforcer, Tony Spilotro, had Bramlet beaten up when he refused. Spilotro also tried to get the union to enroll in a mob-controlled dental plan.
In December 1975, two bombs exploded on the roof of the Alpine Village Restaurant. In January 1976, a bomb exploded at David's Place, a nonunion restaurant in Las Vegas. In January 1977, unexploded bombs were discovered in cars outside the Village Pub and the Starboard Tack restaurant.
Death.
On February 24, 1977, Bramlet was kidnapped at McCarran International Airport by Tom Hanley, his son Gramby Hanley, and Clem Eugene Vaughn. Three weeks after Bramlet disappeared, two hikers discovered Bramlet's body in the desert near Potosi Mountain (Nevada). He had been shot six times, including once in each ear.
Gramby Hanley and Tom Hanley were arrested and pleaded guilty to Bramlet's murder and received life sentences. Clem Eugene Vaughn testified against the Hanleys and received a lesser sentence. The Hanleys said that Bramlet had refused to pay them a $10,000 fee for the attempted bombings of the Village Pub and the Starboard Tack restaurant because the bombs had failed to go off. While they kidnapped Bramlet, they tried to get him to send $10,000 to Binion's Horseshoe Casino; however, the money was never picked up. Tom Hanley died in 1979 while in federal custody. Gramby Hanley entered the United States Federal Witness Protection Program in prison, after giving testimony regarding the bombings and union activities.
Afterwards.
In March 1977, the United States Department of Labor took control away from the trustees of the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Trust, which was the pension fund for Culinary Workers Local 226 and the local bartenders union. The Department of Labor said that this was because the pension fund had made unsafe loans, primarily to Morris Shenker, totaling over 60% of the fund's assets. Shenker was the owner of the Dunes (hotel and casino) and an associate of organized crime figures. Shenker eventually defaulted on these loans and declared bankruptcy in 1984. Gramby Hanley testified that Bramlet received kickbacks of between $1 million and $1.5 million for approving the loans to Shenker.
Bramlet was succeeded as secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Union local by Ben Schmoutey. Schmoutey then turned over control of the local's union health and welfare funds to the parent union in Chicago, and enrolled the union in a mob controlled dental plan. Schmoutey was acquitted in 1979 on charges related to the restaurant bombings. He was defeated for reelection in 1981 by Jeff McColl. During the election, several associates of Spilotro, including Herbert Blitzstein, tried to intimidate union members to vote for Schmoutey. In 1987, Schmoutey was convicted on fraud charges for trying to collect kickbacks from a union health insurance company, and sentenced to five years in prison.

Korean Reformed Churches

The Korean Reformed Churches in Korea (KRC) are a federation of eight theologically conservative Reformed churches that was founded in 2013 in Busan, South Korea.
The Korean Reformed Churches trace their theological roots back to the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation, and especially to the Reformed churches in the Netherlands.
The Korean Reformed Churches subscribe to the Ecumenical Creeds (Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed), the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, and the Canons of Dort, as their doctrinal standards.
The church polity of the Korean Reformed Churches is based on the church order adopted by the Synod of Dort (1618–1619). Contrary to the hierarchical Presbyterian model of church government, the Korean Reformed Churches practice an anti-hierarchical church polity, as embraced in the continental Reformed model of church government.
Liturgically, the Korean Reformed Churches use both the Genevan Psalter and classical hymns that are approved for use by the federation in their worship services.
The Korean Reformed Churches also operate a theological seminary, Korean Reformed Theological Seminary, located in Busan, offering a Master of Divinity program.

Tratayenia

Tratayenia is an extinct genus of megaraptoran theropod dinosaurs known from remains found in the Santonian-age Bajo de la Carpa Formation of Argentina. The type and only species, Tratayenia rosalesi, was described in March 2018.
"Tratayenia" can be distinguished from other megaraptorans on the basis of three autapomorphies (unique derived features) of the front portion of each dorsal vertebra, as well as a single autapomorphy of the sacrum. "Tratayenia" is the youngest known genus of megaraptoran, having lived only about 83 million years ago.
Discovery and naming.
The holotype consists of a well-preserved partial skeleton, MUCPv 1162, which includes several articulated portions of the backbone. One portion of the skeleton is a string of five dorsal vertebrae, likely the seventh to eleventh dorsals. The largest articulated portion of the skeleton is a string of vertebrae including the last two dorsals as well as the five sacrals and much of the right ilium. Other preserved bones include two partial dorsal ribs and fragments of the pubis and ischium.
This skeleton was first discovered in 2006 at a Bajo de la Carpa Formation fossil site by Universidad Nacional del Comahue technician Diego Rosales. Shortly thereafter it was excavated by UNC paleontologist Juan D. Porfifi. Porfiri and his colleagues published a preliminary report on the new dinosaur in a 2008 abstract, and suggested that it may have been a relative of Carcharodontosauridae. In 2018, the new taxon was described with the generic name "Tratayenia", named after Tratayén, the fossil site at which it was excavated. The specific name "Tratayenia rosalesi" honors Diego Rosales.
Description.
"Tratayenia" was a medium-sized megaraptoran, growing up to long. It was closely related to genera such as "Megaraptor", "Australovenator", and "Murusraptor". Like most other megaraptorans, it probably had large claws on its hands for use in hunting prey. Analysis of the Baja de la Carpa indicates that "Tratayenia" may have been geologically the youngest megaraptoran yet discovered. "Tratayenia" is also the largest-bodied carnivorous animal named from the Bajo de la Carpa Formation, reinforcing the hypothesis that megaraptorids were apex predators in southern South America from the Turonian through the Santonian or early Campanian, following the extinction of carcharodontosaurids.
Dorsal vertebrae.
The dorsal vertebrae were tall and narrow, with large pits known as pleurocoels on the side of their centra (spool-shaped main portion). These features are common in the vertebrae of large carnivorous theropods. Some of the vertebrae had fragments of bone in the pleurocoels, which were likely remnants of thin bony walls known as septa which divided the pits. Septa are also known in other megaraptorans and carcharodontosaurids. The neural arches of the vertebrae are taller and narrower in "Tratayenia" than in most other theropods. The tubular transverse processes (rib facets) project upwards and to the side. A large and deep excavation is located directly below each transverse process, bounded from the front and rear by thin laminae (ridges). The front edge is formed by the paradiapophyseal lamina and the rear edge is formed by the posterior centrodiapophyseal lamina. These features are also known in the megaraptoran "Murusraptor".
The prezygapophyses (front vertebral joint plates) are rectangular when see from the side, with the front and lower edges converging at nearly a right angle. This is an autapomorphy (unique adaptation) of "Tratayenia". A ridge known as a prezygodiapophyseal lamina connects the prezygapophyses to the transverse processes. Another autapomorphy of "Tratayenia" is that the prezygodiapophyseal lamina is parallel to the paradiapophyseal lamina. Other theropods either have a weakly developed (or absent) paradiapophyseal lamina, or one which is angled relative to the prezygodiapophyseal lamina. The front edge of each vertebra has a third autapomorphy, related to two pairs of laminae (four total) connecting the prezygapophyses to the neural spines. At the base of the neural spines, the two laminae comprising each pair are very close together. But as the laminae get closer to the prezygapophyses, they diverge into a shape akin to an inverted Y. There are two of these inverted Y-like structures visible from the front, for both the left and right sides of a vertebra.
The postzygapophyses (rear vertebral joint plates) are more typical in shape, and the rear edge of each vertebra has a small, blade-like hyposphene which splits into three ridges from below. The neural spines are tall and rectangular when seen from the side, and uniformly thin when seen from the front. Most are completely vertically, but one of the dorsal vertebrae preserved near the hip slightly inclines forward as in various allosauroids. Preserved rib fragments are curved and hollow. They connected to the vertebrae by means of two distinct condyles, separated by a large opening which may have been continuous with the inner cavity.
Sacrum and hip.
"Tratayenia" has five sacral (hip) vertebrae, as is the norm for theropods. They are very similar to the dorsal vertebrae in various aspects, such as the presence of large pleurocoels, tall and narrow centra, and laminae-bound excavations below the transverse processes. However, they only have a single autapomorphy: the anteroposterior (front-to-back) width of the neural spine increases drastically in the second to fifth sacral vertebrae compared to the first vertebra. In fact, the fifth sacral's neural spine is twice as long anteroposteriorly than that of the first. This trait has also been observed in "Tyrannosaurus" and an unnamed megaraptoran sacrum (SNMS 58023) from the Romualdo Member of the Santana Formation in Brazil, so its status as an autapomorphy of "Tratayenia" is not concrete. Some of the sacral vertebrae have neural spines which are fused together, and the last three curve backwards. The fourth sacral has a shape similar to those of the Santana Formation sacrum.
The ilium (upper blade of the hip) was heavily pneumatized, meaning that it was filled with air pockets. Pneumatization of the ilium is most common in megaraptorans among theropods, as seen in taxa such as "Aerosteon" and "Murusraptor". The outer surface of the ilium is perforated by several pneumatic pores, similar to that of "Aerosteon", but the upper edge of the bone is straight, in contrast with the curved ilium of "Aerosteon". A bone identified as the pubic boot (expanded tip of the pubis) has been found in the holotype, as well as fragments of the ischium, which has the form of a long, thin shaft covered in grooves.
Classification.
Megaraptorans have very controversial relations to other theropods. The first mainstream hypothesis is that they are carnosaurs, distantly related to "Allosaurus" and more closely related to "Neovenator" and carcharodontosaurids. The second popular hypothesis considers them to be basal tyrannosauroids, part of the coelurosaur lineage which includes the crested proceratosaurids as well as the famous tyrannosaurids such as "Tyrannosaurus". A third hypothesis also considers them to be coelurosaurs, but outside Tyrannosauroidea and basal to practically all other groups of Coelurosauria. Porfiri "et al".'s description of "Tratayenia" prefers this third hypothesis.
The cladogram below follows the strict consensus (average result) of the 12 most parsimonious trees (the simplest evolutionary paths, in terms of the total amount of sampled features evolved or lost between sampled taxa) found by Porfiri "et al." (2018)'s phylogenetic analysis. Although the results are different, the methodology analysis was practically identical to that of Apesteguia "et al". (2016), only differing in the fact that it incorporated "Tratayenia" and "Murusraptor", two megaraptorans not sampled in the analysis of Apesteguia "et al".
Paleoecology.
"Tratayenia" lived in the Bajo de la Carpa Formation alongside many lizards and turtles, the snake species "Dinilysia patagonica", many birds such as "Patagopteryx deferrariisi", a diverse amount of crocodylomorphs and many dinosaurs such as "Viavenator exxoni" and "Traukutitan eocaudata".

John Boardman (merchant)

John Boardman (1758-1813) was a merchant and one of the earliest settlers of Troy, New York.
Boardman was born in Preston, Litchfield Country, Connecticut, the fourth of a brood of six. In 1788, he acquired a plot in farmland that had been subdivided by the Van der Heyden family in the previous year. Other settlers of his generation included Stephen Ashley, Benjamin Covell, Samuel Gale, Benjamin Smith, Philip Heartt, Anthony Goodspeed, Mahlon Taylor, Ephraim Morgan, and Ebenezer and Samuel Wilson. As one writer later reminisced of these pioneers, “they were few in number, and possessed but little substance; but they were men of courage and activity…. They were men of shrewd minds. They saw that water power here abounded – and that River navigation to this point was easy. They judged that with its natural advantages, their enterprise could not fail.”
On the night of January 5th, 1789, Boardman and other residents gathered in Ashley’s Inn voted to give the settlement a new designation. Henceforth the town of Vanderheyden would be known as Troy. Thanks to the industry of entrepreneurs like Boardman, Troy grew steadily. It was incorporated as a town in 1791, and upgraded to a village in 1801. Three years after his death, Troy was chartered as a city.
Boardman formed several mercantile partnerships in the course of his career. Morgan, Boardman &amp; Coit was established as early as 1790, and his enterprise went through further permutations as Morgan &amp; Boardman, and later Boardman &amp; Hillhouse. Boardman built a house on the west side of Second Street in Troy on the Hudson River in New York. He served in a number of official capacities in the early history of Troy. He was among the first fire wardens, appointed to the office in 1799, 1801, and 1803, and served as assessor for the Second Ward in 1806. 
In 1800 he married Clarinda Starbuck of Nantucket (1773-1846), the daughter of Daniel and Mary (Folger) Starbuck of Nantucket. Through the Folger side of the family, Clarinda was related to both Benjamin Franklin and Lucretia Mott. Although Clarinda had been raised a Quaker, she had joined the Presbyterian Church when she married John, who was himself of Puritan stock. Their son, Henry Augustus Boardman (1808-1880) would become pastor of the Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, and a denominational leader.

Urban Studies Foundation

The Urban Studies Foundation is a Scottish research charity connected with the Urban Studies Journal. The organization's stated purpose is to provide grant funding for innovative research projects that advance the frontiers of urban knowledge as part of the broader discipline of urban studies. With origins in an academic journal, it is therefore similar to the IJURR Foundation and Antipode Foundation.
The USF currently provides grant funding globally to both post-doctoral research fellows, and scholars who wish to organize seminar series on themes relating to contemporary topics in urban research. It also has grants aimed specifically at researchers from the Global South.

Jacek Rutkowski

Jacek Rutkowski (3 April 1934 – 25 January 2016) – Polish geologist, scientist, professor at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow (Kraków).
Life and education.
Jacek Rutkowski was born in 1934 in Zamość. In 1951 he graduated from Bartłomiej Nowodworski high school in Kraków and began geology studies at the AGH University of Science and Technology. He obtained his master's diploma in 1956 and in the same year he was accepted as an assistant at the Department of Non-metallic Ore Deposits headed by prof. Marian Kamieński. In 1959 he became a senior assistant. A year later, after completing supplementary studies, he obtained a master's engineer’s degree in geology of solid mineral deposits. In 1963 he obtained a doctorate in technical sciences based on the work "Litological development and usage significance of the Senon area of Miechów" and became an adjunct. Jacek Rutkowski obtained his habilitation in the field of deposit geology in 1976, in 1987 he became an associate professor, in 1995 he became a full professor. In 1979 he moved to the Department of Geological Cartography (currently Department of Environmental Analyses, Cartography and Economic Geology) at his home faculty. Between 1979 and 1989 he was the head of the Department. He died in 2016, he was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery in Kraków.
Work.
Professor Rutkowski dealt with both basic and application research. In the first period of his scientific career he mainly studied petrography, sedimentation and physical properties of carbonate rocks, sandstones, gravels and mineral resources. After his transfer to the Department of Geological Cartography, his research interests extended to issues of Quaternary geology, geomorphology, as well as geological mapping.
His greatest achievements included research into the lithology of the Niecka Niedziańska chalk, conditions of sedimentation and lithology of Sarmatian limestones from the south-western Świętokrzyskie Mountains, tectonics and Quaternary deposits around Kraków, as well as the environment of Wigry Lake. In addition, he developed his own, currently widely used, Quaternary gravel research method, he was a pioneer in Poland of universal use of aerial and satellite images for geological and geomorphological cartography, as well as the use of high-resolution seismics for lake sediment research. He developed his own gravitational core probe for collecting sediments from the lake bottom. Together with Prof. Elżbieta Mycielska-Dowgiałło he co-edited and contributed to two books: “Researches of Quaternary sediments, some methods and interpretation of the results” (1995) and another one on studies of textural features of Quaternary sediments and some methods of their dating (2007).
At his Alma Mater, Jacek Rutkowski lectured geomorphology, Quaternary geology, geological mapping and structural geology. He conveyed his scientific passion to students, first and foremost, during field courses and field research.
Prof. Rutkowski devoted last 20 years of his life to studies of the Lake Wigry in Podlasie. His unique achievement was organization of an informal, interdisciplinary team of scientists from all over Poland, from students to renowned professors. The group members, drawn by the authority and personality of the professor, under his leadership, devoted themselves (free of charge) to the environmental research of the lake and its surroundings. Beginning with the study of lithology of gravels from the bottom of Wigry, with time, the scope of research was extended to geology, hydrochemistry, hydrobiology, sediment dating and study of the evolution of the Wigry lake environment and neighbouring lakes (mainly dystrophic ones, called “suchar”). A measurable effect of this group's activity, was a hundred dozen scientific publications, several dozen graduation theses and a monograph entitled "Lake Wigry. History of the Lake in the Light of Geological and Palaeoecological Research" published in 2009.
Jacek Rutkowski was the author or co-author of around 250 scientific papers, including "Krakow" and "Miechów" sheets of the Detailed Geological Map of Poland 1: 50000, promoter of 6 doctoral dissertations and reviewer of many doctoral and habilitation dissertations. He was an honorary member of the Polish Geological Society, a founding member of the Polish Limnological Society, and a member of, among others, of the Commission on Quaternary Palaeogeography of the Polish Academy of Science and Art and the Committee of Quaternary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
Awards and decorations.
Winner of numerous awards and distinctions: the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1987), the Golden Cross of Merit (1976) and the Medal of the National Education Commission (1994), the prestigious Ludwik Zejszner scientific prize awarded by the Polish Geological Society (1965), Honorary Badge of the Podlasie Voivodship (2014) awarded for outstanding research achievements in the Wigry National Park and numerous other prizes.

Sulagitti Narasamma

Sulagitti Narasamma (1920 – 25 December 2018) was an Indian midwife from Pavagada town, in Tumkur district of Karnataka state. She performed more than 20,000 traditional deliveries free of charge over a 70-year period of service in deprived regions of Karnataka with no medical facilities. Her work was honored with the National Citizen's award of India in 2012 and the country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, in 2018.
Biography.
Narasamma was born in Krishnapura, Pavagada village in Tumkur district to a nomadic culture. Her first language was Telugu. She did not attend school and grew up illiterate; she married her husband, Anjinappa, at the age of 12. She had 12 children, although four died when young, and 36 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
She learnt her midwifery skills from her grandmother, Marigemma, a midwife who also helped to deliver five of Narasamma's own babies. In 1940, at the age of 20, Narasamma assisted at her first birth when she helped with the delivery of her aunt's baby.
Narasamma had the opportunity to keep practising her midwifery skills whenever nomadic tribes arrived at her village. She also learned the art of preparing natural medicine for pregnant women and soon became competent in checking the health and position of the baby. She was also reportedly able to detect the pulse of the foetus while in the womb, without the use of any instruments.
By 2018, and at the age of 97 years old, Narasamma had helped to deliver more than 15,000 babies, and has been described as 'the go-to midwife of Krishnapura'.
Awards and honors.
Narasamma received the following awards and citations:
Death.
Narasamma was admitted to the Siddaganga Hospital and Research Centre in November 2018 and was later referred to BGS Hospitals on 29 November 2018. She died at BGS Gleneagles Global Hospitals in Kengeri, Bengaluru, Karnataka, on 25 December 2018 at the age of 98 of chronic lung disease.
On 25 December 2018, Narasamma's body was kept at Glass House in Tumakuru for the public to pay tributes. Several Ministers, former Ministers and thousands of people from different walks of life also paid their tributes to the departed soul. On 26 December 2018, Narasamma was laid to rest with full state honours at Gangasandra village on the outskirts of the Tumakuru city. Half acre of the one-acre plot was set aside for a memorial.

Battle of Benadir

The second Ajuran–Portuguese Conflict (1542) was an armed engagement between the Ajuran Sultanate and the Portuguese Empire.
Background.
After the Portuguese conducted a large-scale naval expedition to Suez in 1541, the Ottoman Empire dedicated greater resources into protecting the Red Sea from Portuguese intrusion. To such effect, about 25 galleys were armed and stationed at Aden. 
The Portuguese captain of Sofala, João de Sepúlveda, was informed of the presence of these forces by allied Swahili city-states, mainly Malindi, who also reported that the hostile Ajuran Sultanate had appealed to the Ottomans for military support, in preparation for a rebellion against Portuguese suzerainty in the region. João de Sepúlveda thus set out with 6 small galleys and 100 soldiers to conduct a preemptive strike against the coastal cities of the Ajuran Sultanate. He was joined by an unrecorded number of vessels and warriors from Malindi. 
The Battle.
At Mogadishu, João de Sepúlveda "destroyed the city and did them great damage and injury". Moving a few leagues north, he reached a popular anchorage for tradeships coming from the Red Sea, where he learned that the Turks would not be sailing to East Africa that year. Thus he returned to what remained of Mogadishu, and made a peace deal with its rulers.
Passing by Barawa, the city was sacked, in retaliation for its inhabitants having delivered a few Portuguese prisoners to the Turks. After sealing peace with Barawa, João de Sepúlveda returned to Malindi.
The word benadir means coast in Somali referring to the richness of southern Somali coast.

Bobby Poyner

Robert William Poyner (born December 1, 1992) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent. He throws and bats left-handed, and is listed at and . He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox.
Early years.
Poyner attended Palm Beach Central High School in Wellington, Florida. He played for the school's baseball team, but suffered a torn labrum in 2011, his senior year. He enrolled at the University of Florida and played college baseball for the Florida Gators from 2012 through 2015. While at Florida, he pursued a degree in finance. In 2013 and 2014, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League.
Professional career.
The Boston Red Sox selected Poyner in the 14th round, with the 411th overall selection, of the 2015 MLB draft. After he signed, he made his professional debut with the Lowell Spinners of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League, and spent the whole season there, pitching to a 1–2 record and 2.28 ERA in 17 relief appearances.
Poyner began the 2016 season with the Greenville Drive of the Class A South Atlantic League, and was promoted in June to the Salem Red Sox of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. In innings pitched between the two teams, he compiled a 3–1 record and 3.15 ERA.
In 2017, Poyner started the season with Salem, and was promoted to the Portland Sea Dogs of the Double-A Eastern League. He posted a combined 2–1 record, 1.49 ERA, and 0.93 WHIP with 84 strikeouts in total innings pitched between the two teams. After the regular season, he pitched in the Arizona Fall League.
In 2018, the Red Sox invited Poyner to spring training as a non-roster player to compete for a major league role; he was named to Boston's Opening Day roster. Poyner made his MLB debut on March 31, pitching of an inning against the Tampa Bay Rays while allowing one hit, a home run by Carlos Gómez. Poyner recorded his first major league win on April 5, pitching two innings of scoreless relief, again against Tampa Bay. On April 12, Poyner was placed on the 10-day disabled list, due to a left hamstring strain; he was subsequently sent to Double-A Portland and the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox on rehabilitation assignments, and then optioned to Pawtucket. He was recalled to Boston on May 4, pitched one inning that day against the Texas Rangers, and optioned back to Pawtucket the next day. Poyner was recalled to Boston on May 15, made two appearances, and sent back to Triple-A on May 24. On June 2, Poyner was recalled to Boston, made one appearance, and returned to Pawtucket on June 7. He was again recalled to Boston on July 14, but did not make an appearance before being returned to Triple-A on July 21. Poyner was called up to Boston on September 1, when rosters expanded. He finished the season with a 1–0 record in 20 appearances with Boston, recording a 3.22 ERA and 24 strikeouts in innings. Poyner was not included on Boston's postseason roster, as the team went on to win the World Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
In 2019, Poyner was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket prior to Opening Day. He was recalled to Boston on April 20, when Nathan Eovaldi went on the injured list, and optioned back to Pawtucket after the first game of a doubleheader on April 23. Poyner was later recalled to Boston on June 10, and optioned back to Pawtucket two days later. He was recalled to Boston on September 4, following the end of the Triple-A season. Overall with the 2019 Red Sox, Poyner appeared in 13 games (one start), compiling an 0–1 record with 6.94 ERA and 11 strikeouts in innings.
On January 15, 2020, Poyner was designated for assignment by the Red Sox. Six days later, he was assigned outright to Triple-A Pawtucket. Prior to the delayed start of the 2020 season, Poyner was added to Boston's alternate player pool on July 17, and was removed from the alternate player pool on July 21.
Poyner was assigned to the Triple-A Worcester Red Sox to begin the 2021 season. After recording a 9.69 ERA across 8 appearances in Worcester, Poyner was released by the Red Sox organization on July 5, 2021.

Box (Gas album)

Box is the second boxed set released by Wolfgang Voigt under his Gas alias. The album collects the compact disc versions of "Zauberberg", "Königsforst ", "Pop" and "Oktember". The album marked Voigt's return to the Gas project, with a new album, "Narkopop", seeing release the year after "Box". The boxed set consisted of 10 vinyl records (3 per album, 1 for "Oktember") as well as 4 compact discs and an art book.
"Box" contains some differences between its contents and the previously issued versions of each album. Apart from overall remastering of the music, several songs appear in slightly longer versions. Notably, the A1 and D1 songs exclusive to the vinyl version of "Königsforst" were appended to the end of that disc, marking their first digital appearance. Also, the first song of "Oktember" was replaced with "Tal '90", a piece released on Kompakt's compilation "Pop Ambient 2002", as the original piece is identical to the first piece of "Königsforst".

Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup

Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup (15 February 1869 – 6 November 1931), was a renowned scholar in Sanskrit and Malayalam, who composed the first Malayalam epic poem "Ramachandravilasam".
Biography.
He was born in Azhakathu family as the son of Narayanan Embraadhiri and Kochukunju Kunjamma and was named as "Azhakathu Palliyaadi Eashwaren Padmanabhan".
He was also trained in Hindi language from his father. "Azhakathu Padmanabhan Kurup" became great devotee of Rama after reading Ramacharitamanasa of Tulasidas . His devotion influenced him to compose the epic " Ramachandravilasam".
"Ramachandravilasam" is the first epic in Malayalam that strictly adheres to all the rules of composition, which has 21 sargas, 1832 slokas and 'chitrasargam'. The theme of the poem is based on Ramayana, except the part called 'utharakandam', which has been omitted in the epic poetry.
"Ramachandravilasam" became a milestone in Malayalam literature, especially in Mahakavya, for this author has made a maiden attempt. Till then Mahakavya were written in Sanskrit on the belief that Malayalam doesn't have the essence for epic composition. Azhakathu started this work in 1894 but took few years to complete it.
During the composition, in order to understand the opinion of readers on an entirely new piece of work, he published his initial draft of "Ramachandravilasam", which had 8 sargas, anonymously on a famous newspaper 'Malayalee' of that time. Disappointingly, he didn't receive any response from the readers. So Azhakathu send a letter to Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran seeking his opinion and also informed that "Ramachandravilasam" that was published on the newspaper is composed by him. Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran responded by appreciating his work and also encouraged Azhakathu to complete his remaining work as it would be a turning point in Malayalam literature.
In 1905, Azhakathu completed the composition of "Ramchandravilasam" and published it on 'Malayalee' newspaper. He then approached his well-wisher A. R. Raja Raja Varma to review his work and provide suggestions. After including the suggestions from A. R. Raja Raja Varma, the final draft of "Ramachandravilasam" was published in 'Avatharika' in 1907.
 "Ramachandravilasam" has all the features of a neo-classical epic. In the preface to the poem, the poet has declared Bhojachambu as his model. He has also stated that the ideas of many Sanskrit scholars have been adapted by him. Nevertheless, "Ramchandravilasam" has its own place in the history of Malayalam literature.
Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup has also made notable contributions in Aattakatha, drama, Kilippattu, Khandakavyam and Balasahityam. Some of his best known works were 'Gandharvavijayam' (Aattakatha), 'Meenakethana Charitham' (Drama), 'Prabhushakthi' (Khandakavyam), kuvalayaasweeyam' (Kilippattu). He has also made translations of Sanskrit classics into Malayalam. In 1894 Azhakathu married 'Pallickal Puthiyaveethil Bhaageeradhi Kunjamma' and the couple had 8 children. He was a Sanskrit teacher in Chavara Govt. High School, Kollam and later retired as 'Munshi' from service.
Even though his work was notable in Malayalam literature unfortunately there aren't much details recorded in history about the life of this poet.

<doc id="56894775" url="?curid=56894775" title="EA-3990">
EA-3990

EA-3990 is a deadly carbamate nerve agent. It is lethal because it inhibits acetylcholinesterase. Inhibition causes an overly high accumulation of acetylcholine between the nerve and muscle cells. This paralyzes the muscles by preventing their relaxation. The paralyzed muscles include the muscles used for breathing.
Patent assigned to US army for EA-3990 among other similar nerve agents was filed in December 7, 1967.
Lethality.
EA-3990 lethality in humans is unknown but estimates have been made.
Carbamates like EA-3990 are well absorbed by the lungs, gastrointestinal tracts, and the skin. Signs and symptoms from exposure to such carbamates are similar to other nerve agents. In general their penetration through the blood-brain barrier is difficult due to quaternary nitrogens in these molecules. Despite this, EA-3990 is claimed to be about three times more toxic than VX (another nerve agent). For VX, the median lethal dose (LD50) for 70 kg men via exposure to the skin is estimated to be 10 mg, and the lethal concentration time (LCt50), measuring the concentration of the vapor per length of time exposed, is estimated to be 30–50 mg·min/m3. These values for EA-3990 can be estimated to be 3.3 mg and 10–16.7 mg·min/m3 by division.
Intravenous LD50 for EA-3990 is 0.0063 mg/kg for mice and 0.0026 mg/kg for rabbits.
Properties.
EA-3990's CAS is 110913-95-6, mass 718.7 g/mol, melting point 190–191 °C, density 1.33 g/cm3, vapor pressure is negligible, and it is soluble in alcohols, acetic acid and chloroform. It is a white, odorless crystalline solid. EA-3990 evaporates slowly in to the air; thus it can be classified as being extremely persistent in the environment if any possible effects of external factors like sun light and water (air humidity) upon it are neglected. Various salts other than bromide have been reported.
Synthesis.
Two methods have been described for synthesizing EA-3990 along with similar nerve agents.
The 2-dimethylaminomethyl-3-dimethylcarbamoxypyridine precursor is prepared via a Mannich reaction using 3-pyridol (CAS 109-00-2), dimethylamine and formaldehyde. The resulting 2-((Dimethylamino)methyl)pyridin-3-ol (CAS 2168-13-0) is then carbamoylated with dimethylcarbamoyl chloride. Other secondary amines can be used, such as those containing methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl and benzyl groups.
In the first method 2 moles of 2-dimethylaminomethyl-3-dimethylcarbamoxypyridine and app. 1 mol α,ω-dihaloalkane (e.g. 1,8-dibromooctane in this case) in acetonitrile is heated on a steam bath for 6 hours. It is then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The crystalline product is collected by filtration.
In the second method 2 mol and 1 mol of the previous reagents used in the first method are added together, but also a catalytic amount of sodium iodide in acetonitrile is added to the solution, which is then allowed to stand for 6 days. Crystalline material is usually formed during this period and it is then collected by filtration.
In both methods, after filtration, the crystalline product is triturated with acetone. If no solid separates, ethyl acetate is added to precipitate the crude product. The product is then dissolved in hot ethanol and treated with decolorizing charcoal. Ethyl acetate is added to the filtered solution to precipitate the crystalline product. E-3990 is then collected and dried. Yield is 63%.

Background and development.
In November 2010, Coyle released her debut studio album, "Insatiable". Coyle collaborated with producers such as Toby Gad, Guy Chambers and William Orbit. Upon its release, the album received generally mixed to unfavourable reviews from music critics, and was met with limited commercial success due to an exclusive distribution through Tesco stores.
Wanting to release a potential follow-up record, Coyle announced that she and Brian Higgins of Xenomania had begun working on new material in 2014. In the following year, she confirmed that she was recording the album and that it would be released the same year, but production was halted and the album was never completed.
In July 2017, it was announced that Coyle had signed a recording deal with Virgin EMI Records, through which the EP was released.

"Nadine" was announced on 5 February 2018, and its tracks were released bi-weekly leading up to its release date. In promotion of the EP, a concert tour consisting of seven dates was announced on the same day, but was later cancelled.
Critical reception.
Lauren O'Neill of "Noisey UK" described the EP as "unabashed British pop" and has kept a "formula of relative timelessness" comparable to that of Girls Aloud's.

Hubert Jura

Hubert Jura aka Herbert Jung (born 1915) was a Polish Army officer, resistance fighter, and a Nazi collaborator (SD or Gestapo agent) who was sentenced to death by the Home Army.
Biography.
He was born in Tucheler Heide, German Empire. He was first an officer of the Polish Army, then of the underground Home Army which he left or from which he was removed after some of his crimes came to light, and subsequently a member of the nationalist National Armed Forces as well as his own organization. The organization he created, Tom’s Organization, collaborated with the Germans. Jura was sentenced to death by the Home Army underground court for his collaboration with Nazi Germany. 
Jura came from a Pomeranian mixed family with Polish and German roots. In 1943, after removing him from the Home Army, he set up his own intelligence organization (Tom's Organization). At the end of summer he started cooperation with the officer of the SS (and at the same time the Gestapo). Probably offered him a cooperation which consisted of a common fight against the communists, in exchange for the supply of arms for "Tom Organization" and care during his travels between Warsaw and Radom. In 1944, after the fall of the Warsaw Uprising, members of the Tom Organization came to Częstochowa. “Tom" received a villa from the Germans at Jasnogórska Street, which became the headquarter of the group for a few months.
In 1944, a group of soldiers of the National Armed Forces commanded by Jura attacked the village of Petrykozy. According to the report from March 9, two Jews hiding there were murdered. After the war, Jura and former Gestapo member Paul Fuchs operated for the US intelligence network created to work in the newly established countries controlled by the Soviet Union. Later, Jura moved to Venezuela, and in 1993 to Argentina.

The Woman-Killer and the Hell of Oil

 is a Bunraku play by Chikamatsu Monzaemon, also performed in kabuki.
The play was first performed August 9, 1721 on the stage. It is supposedly based on actual events that were said to have taken place the night before Boy's Festival in 1721; however, little is known about the crime. The play was not well-received when it was first performed, and it was only during the end of the nineteenth century that the play began to be considered a masterpiece and started to be performed frequently. While originally written for it was successfully staged in in a rivial in 1909 by Jitsukawa Enjaku II. It is the only "sewamono" (contemporary setting plays in Japanese traditional theatre) to feature a murderer as the 'hero' role.
Plot.
"The Woman-Killer and the Hell of Oil" is a play in three acts. The main character is Yohei, a 23 year old oil merchant, who frequently runs up debts and spends a lot of time in the licensed quarter.
Act One.
The first act takes place as pilgrims are traveling to the Temple of Kanzeon in Nozaki. Waxy of Aizu is a rich customer who has fallen in love with Kogiku, a courtesan of the Flower House, in the Sonezaki licensed quarter. He takes her on a boat ride to Nozaki to see the temple. They disembark at Sarara just before Nozaki.
Along comes Okichi, age 27, and her three daughters, the oldest one being nine. The middle child, Okiyo, who is six, asks to stop for tea at a nearby stall. Okichi agrees so that they can wait for her husband, an oil merchant named Teshimaya Shichizaemon, to catch up with them. As they are resting, along comes their neighbor, Yohei, who lives with his parents in a house diagonal to Okichi's. Yohei has come with some fellow oil merchants who are his friends.
Seeing Yohei, Okichi asks him and his friends to join her. Okichi finds out that Yohei is waiting to catch Kogiku, who rejected his offer to go on the pilgrimage, giving the reason that Nozaki was in an unlucky direction so he refused to go. Okichi then chastises Yohei for his behavior, using the pilgrimage as an excuse, and spending so much time in the licensed quarter. He tells him of all the rumors about him and how he frequently runs up debts. Okichi then leaves money for the drinks and goes on ahead.
Kogiku and Waxy then approach the tea stand. At first they do not notice Yohei and his friends, but when Kogiku does, she tries to get away. However, Yohei is too quick and pulls her to a bench outside the tea house. Yohei then berates Kogiku for going out with another customer after declining his invitation. Kogiku, however, says that she only did it because of the rumors circulating about Yohei and herself. She promises she loves him and whispers sweet nothings into his ear. Waxy then sits down next to the two of them, aggravated. He presses Kogiku to repeat what she told him last night. Yohei's friends then prepare to fling mud at Waxy. Waxy then kicks them, knocking one out and he splashes in the water. The other is kicked in the groin and doubles over in pain. Yohei joins the fight, and they trade punches. They eventually both crash into the river and throw mud and reeds at one another.
At the same time, a samurai named Oguri Hachiya is visiting the temple in the name of his lord Takatsuki. He is escorted by a procession of foot soldiers who cry out, "Make way! Make way!" However, Yohei continues to sling mud. Some splatters on the samurai and his horse. Waxy heads to the other bank and escapes, while Yohei is surrounded. Head of the foot soldiers, Yamamoto Moriemon, is Yohei's uncle. Since Yohei has caused such a disgrace, he decides to cut off Yohei's head. Oguri Hachiya stops him since the sight of blood would ruin the pilgrimage. Yamamoto Moriemon instead decides to do it on the way back.
Yohei is left in shock and cannot find the way back to Osaka so that he can escape. Just then Okichi has turned back since the crowd was so large, and was deciding to wait at the tea house again for her husband. Yohei begs for her help. Okichi decides to help him and wipe down his kimono, and they enter the tea house.
Okichi's husband, Teshimaya Shichizaemon, finally comes along. Okiyo, his daughter, sees him, and he asks where her mother is. Okiyo says she is with Yohei and they have taken off their sashes and kimonos. Shichizaemon grows angry, thinking that his wife is having an affair with Yohei. He orders them to come out of the tea house. Okichi comes out, thankful that her husband has finally caught up with them. Yohei expresses his gratitude for Okichi's help. Yohei's face is still covered in mud. Shichizaemon chastises his wife for not thinking about what people would say if they saw the two of them together wiping him down.
Thus Shichizaemon, Okichi, and their three daughters leave to go to the temple. Yohei hears the cries of "Make way! Make way!" as and Oguri Hachiya are returning from the temple. Yohei tries to get away, but is caught by his uncle Moriemon. Oguri Hachiya though tells him to let Yohei go since he has changed and no longer has mud on him. Yohei is spared.
Act Two.
Act Two takes place at the Kawachi-ya, an oil shop in Osaka tree days before the Boys' Festival. Pilgrims who have just returned from a mountain pilgrimage talk to Tokubei and Osawa, Yohei's stepfather and mother. Tokubei is not Yohei's biological father, and instead was a servant of Yohei's father; after he died he married Osawa and took over the oil shop. Osawa mentions that their daughter, Okachi, has been sick with a cold for over a week. The pilgrims mention a mountain priest named White Fox who can cure her. After the pilgrims depart, Tahei (Yohei's older brother) arrives bearing a letter from their Uncle Moriemon mentioning the incident with Yohei in Act One and that he can no longer serve his master and will be traveling to Osaka. Tahei tells his parents to throw Yohei out once and for all. However, Tokubei is self-conscious of his position as stepfather and the former servant of Yohei's late father. Still Tahei tells him to disinherit Yohei.
Okachi cries out in anguish and the mountain priest arrives as Tahei then exits. Osawa is also out getting medicine for Okachi. Yohei then arrives and degrades the priest, stating that the sickness Okachi has is mortal and that the best doctor could not hope to cure it. He then lies to Tokubei, stating that he met his Uncle Moreimon and that his uncle has embezzled three of silver; if he cannot return the money by the holidays he will be forced to committ seppuku. Tokubei knows that Yohei is lying due to having just read the letter that Tahei delivered from the uncle. He says that he does not have any money to lend and if Yohei is so interested in helping, he should liquidate his assets.
Yohei then sprawls out on the floor playing with an abacus as the priest examines Okachi. The priest determines that her sickness is from her melancholy arising from the desire to get married. As the priest is about to start the prayer, Okachi speaks in a trance, stating that the way to cure her is to call off the wedding engagement and that Yohei's debts and pain bring her agony. She asks that they redeem the woman Yohei loves (Kogiku) and let her be his bride and give him his own household. The priest then attempts to exorcise the demon. Yohei, however, springs to his feet and pushes the priest from the room. The priest attempts to come back into the room; every time he does, Yohei casts him out again. Finally, the priest gives up and Yohei goes over to Tokubei begging that he listen to what Okachi said.
However, Tokubei refutes it, saying that if he redeems the prostitute that Yohei loves, he will destroy the families and will be unable to pray for Yohei's late father. Yohei then asks if it is his intention to get a husband for Okachi and give him the household, which Tokubei confirms. Yohei kicks Tokubei in anger, who falls, and Yohei continues to stomp on him. Okachi clings to Yohei and begs him to stop. She then confesses that she was not actually sick but was acting as Yohei had asked her to. Yohei is angry that she revealed their secret; he then kicks her down as well and continues to kick them both. Osawa returns and cries out in dismay. She seizes Yohei by the hair and hits him in the face as she wipes away tears. She berates him, saying that he should respect his father and sister. Osawa then casts Yohei out and disinherits him. Okachi begs their mother not to do it and to forgive Yohei. Osawa then berates Tokubei for not standing up for himself. Osawa grabs a pole in order to drive Yohei from the house, but he quickly tears it away from her and uses it to attack her. Tokubei steps in and attacks Yohei in return, his eyes glaring with rage while holding back tears. Tokubei then reveals that he had no intention to find a husband for Okachi and that it was merely a ruse in order to try and motivate Yohei. He says he has cared for Yohei like a real father, yet Yohei has shown nothing but selfishness and beats his own mother and sister. He then breaks down in tears, dropping the pole. Osawa, picking it up once more, chases Yohei from the shop, despite attempts from Okachi to stop her. Finally Yohei crosses the threshold and leaves.
As Yohei walks away, he checks his money pouch to see how much he has left. However, noticing that Tokubei is coming out of the shop, he quickly puts it away and walks away. Tokubei, seeing him leave, breaks down in tears, commenting that as the years pass Yohei looks more and more like that of the late master. He comments that he feels that he is not driving away Yohei, but his master himself and that he is heartbroken. Osakwa, though she called Yohei a villain, can no longer fight back the tears either and attempts to catch a glance of Yohei though he is now too far away.
Act Three.
Act Three takes place on the evening of the Boys' Festival at the Teshima-ya, the oil shop owned by Shichizae-mon, the husband of Okichi.
Shichizae-mon, with 7/10ths of his bill collecting accomplished, returns home before starting out again. Okichi remarks that he is home early and that she has taken care of the household account. However, Shichizae-mon comments that the night's work is not yet finished and he must return once more to finish. Okichi states that he has done enough for the night and can finish collecting after the holiday. However, Shichizae-mon says that if he does not collect it tonight, it will never be collected. He hands her his money belt containing 580 of new silver and asks her to lock it up in the cupboard for him, stating that he will be home soon. Okiku, their daughter, then goes to pour her father some sake before he leaves—both of them standing. Okichi, seeing this, mentions that he should know better than to stand while drinking sake otherwise he will send someone to their grave, and he quickly sits down as a result. After finishing his sake he takes his leave. Okichi then puts her children to bed.
Yohei is outside, wearing an old kimono with sleeves too short for him; a dagger is concealed at his waist. He peeps in at the Teshima-ya, as a voice calls out to him. It is the moneylender Kohei from the cotton shop in Uemachi. He has been looking for Yohei to try and collect a debt and found out that his parents cast him out. However, Tokubei's seal was on the debt note; Kohei has decided that if he does not get his in new silver by tonight, he will denounce him to the authorities. Yohei mentions that while the figure on the one is one "," Yohei only received 200 (about 1/5th of one ). Koehi says that if he can return the 200 by 6 o'clock in the morning, he will not cause any trouble. However, if he does not have the money by that time, the debt shall be one and he will have Tokubei pay it. Youhei promises that he will have the money, saying that he is a man of his word. Kohei says if he still needs money after paying him back, he will lend it to him and then departs. However, Yohei has not a cent on him. Yohei must find the 200 somewhere.
Yohei hears a sound behind him, and noticing Tokubei coming, he hides. Tokubei enters Teshima-ya to find Okichi. Tokubei mentions that he has disinherited Yohei but talks at length that he could be in trouble with debt as it is collection day and Yohei could get desperate. He asks Okichi if she sees Yohei to ask him to apologize to his mother and return home, saying that he has decided to forgive him. Tokubei chokes with tears but pretends that smoke from his pipe has gotten in his eyes. Okichi asks him to stay until her husband returns, but Tokubei does not want to take up his time. He gets out his wallet and takes out 300 saying that he got it without his wife looking. He gives the money to Okichi, asking her to give it to Youhei if she sees him and begging her to not let Yohei know that it was him who gave the money.
Another voice is heard and Tokubei attempts to hide, but Osawa, who is the newly arrived visitor, sees him. Yohei has been watching and listening in from outside where he has been hiding. Osawa asks Tokubei why he is here when Shichizae-mon is gone. He talks down to him for not taking his wife and daughter more seriously and doting on Yohei too much. However, Tokubei states that a parent will always love their child. Tokubei says that if he must leave, they leave together, and as he pulls on her kimono sleeve, something falls to the floor. It is "," a sweet normally eaten at the Boys' Festival, and 500 "." Osawa throws herself on the money, stating how embarrassing it is, her voice rising in grief. She then begs for forgiveness from Tokubei for she stole the money from their own accounts in order to give to Yohei. She mentions that how can she hate Yohei, his own mother. She is sure that he is so wicked because of some deed she committed in her past life. Mentioning her overwhelming guilt at casting Yohei out. Tokubei forgives her and they both cry, and finally Tokubei tells her to leave the money and food with Okichi so that she may give it to Yohei. Okichi understands and says she shall deliver it, and the two depart together.
After seeing his parents depart, Yohei nods to himself and hides his dagger. He then enters the Teshima-ya, calling out to Okichi. Okichi mentions that 800 and have fallen from heaven with the command that she give it to Yohei. Yohei says that he knows his parents gave him the money since he was listening in the whole time saying he wept through it all. Okichi asks if he has finally understood what his parents have gone through. Yohei says he has, stating that he will become a good son and devote his strength to serving his parents. However, he says that the gift of money from his parents is not enough to cover the debts that he is in. He begs Okichi to lend him 200 and says that he will repay her as soon as his parents call off his disinheritance. Okichi says that Yohei's words betray him and he has not reformed. Further, stating that while she has 500 in the safe, it is not within her power to lend a single copper while her husband is away. She says that on the day of pilgrimage she was washing his clothes and was suspected of improper conduct. Yohei begs her to lend the money to him, but Okichi continues to refuse. Yohei mentions that he is a human as well and that his parents' words have sunk deep into his soul and he is miserable. He tells Okichi his situation, saying that he was determined to kill himself should he bring ruin to his family by not being able to repay the debt. Moved, Okichi starts to go for the safe, but then thinks it is another one of Yohei's tricks. She refuses to lend him the money. Yohei, defeated, says that he will not ask again but instead asks that she fill up his cask with three quarts of oil on credit. She agrees, as that is their business. As she measures out the oil, Yohei draws his dagger and looks at it, contemplating. In the other room, Okichi says that he should enjoy the holiday and that his parents will likely take him back provided they can afford him, and asks him for forgiveness for refusing to loan him money. She is then startled by the glint of his blade reflected in the lamp oil. She asks what it is, and Yohei hides the dagger behind her, stating that it is nothing; she asks why he is staring at her with such a terrible expression. She asks him to show his right hand. Yohei moves the dagger to his other hand and then shows his right. Okichi starts to tremble telling him not to come any closer as Yohei starts to follow her. She attempts to escape but cannot get away as Yohei leaps at her. Okichi screams and begs to be spared. Yohei asks her to die quietly. They struggle and a night wind extinguishes the light in the shop as they are enveloped in darkness. In the darkness Yohei slips and spills oil. They slip and slide on the oil and blood, Yohei's face is smeared with blood. Finally he is able to get hold of her and kills her. Covered in oil and blood, he gets the key and unlocks the cupboard, barely able to stand, thunder clapping overhead. He retrieves the 580 and hastily stuffs it into his kimono. It weighs him down and his steps are heavy. He runs out of the house and away as fast as his legs will carry him.
Most performances of the play end here; however, the script goes on.
Sometime after the festival, Yohei's uncle Moriemon goes looking for him, who is back with Kogiku. No one knows for certain that it was Yohei who killed Okichi and stole the money. Before his uncle arrives, however, Yohei flees, stating he left his wallet somewhere else. His uncle talks to the shop and then leaves as well. At Shichizae-mon's house on the 35th night after the murder of Okichi, Shichizae-mon is mourning her when Yohei arrives, who has been making frequent condolence calls in order to kill suspicion that he committed the murder. However, Shichizae-mon has found proof and subdues Yohei. Moriemon arrives with guards and Tahei and tells of the widespread rumors that Yohei is the murderer. Moriemon and Tahei weep to have such a nephew and brother. Yohei speaks his last monologue, stating that previously he had never stolen so much as a copper, though he was often late in paying his debts. He recounts what drove him to madness, due to not wanting to ruin his father with undue debt, and confesses to the crime. The men seize and bind him. They drag him to his final destination where he will be executed.

Harvey Daiho Hilbert Roshi (born 1947) is a psychotherapist and an expert on post-Vietnam stress syndrome. He is an ordained Soto Zen priest and the founding abbot of the Order of Clear Mind Zen and a leader of the Zen community in southern New Mexico. He was featured in a documentary on Vietnam Veterans that aired on both National Public Radio's "Morning Edition" and PBS station KRWG-TV. During combat in the Vietnam War Hilbert was shot in the head, leaving him paralyzed on the left side of his body. Despite his injuries, Hilbert went on to college.
Early life and education.
Hilbert was born in New Jersey in 1947 and grew up in Florida. A high school drop out, he enlisted in the Army in 1964 at age 17. In 1966 he was assigned to Company A, 35th Infantry Division, 3rd Brigade Task Force in Vietnam. On May 29, 1966, his company was taken by helicopter to an ongoing battle at LZ 10 Alpha near Pleiku Province, Vietnam as part of Operation Paul Revere. During the fighting Hilbert was shot in the head, resulting in an 8-square-inch hole in his skull. He also was hit in the back with shrapnel. Due to combat, he could not be airlifted out until the following morning.
Hilbert was taken to a field hospital, where bullet fragments were removed from his brain. The wounds left him paralyzed on his left side. After rehabilitation, he recovered the use of most of his leg and some functioning of his arm.
He obtained his bachelor's degree (multidisciplinary) from Coker College, and then attended Case Western Reserve University to study social work, obtaining both his master's and PhD. Hilbert is also an artist. After his release from the Army, Hilbert dedicated himself to working with those suffering from combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
Military awards.
On September 27, 1966, Hilbert's unit received the Presidential Unit Citation (United States).
Also for his service, Hilbert was awarded a Purple Heart and the National Defense Service Medal.
Trauma victim work.
After college, Hilbert began a private practice focused on helping trauma survivors, which continued for nearly three decades. A key component of his treatment was the use of contemplative practices with his clients. In addition to his private practice he also served as a consultant to other PTSD treatment facilities.
Eventually his business grew into the Proact Corporation, a canopy organization, which consisted of Rainbeau Research and Counseling Centers, Professional Guidance Institute, Employee Assistance Program, and Stress Intervention Centers. The companies served patients from seven offices in two states.
Hilbert twice testified before the U.S. Congress as an expert witness on those suffering from PTSD.
Zen.
At 19, he began meditating and studying Zen. and eventually became a student of Ken Hogaku Shozen McGuire roshi at the Dharma Mountain Zendo in Cloudcroft, New Mexico. In 2000, he was ordained a Soto Zen priest and was installed as abbot of Daibutsuji Zen Temple in Las Cruces. In 2005, he was given Dharma Transmission.
In 2005, he retired from clinical practice to establish the Order of Clear Mind Zen in Las Cruces, New Mexico, with affiliates in northern California, Virginia, and West Texas. Hilbert has a history of street practice, bearing witness for peace, and continues his community service with vulnerable populations.
Books and studies.
Hilbert contributed to several books and studies, including "Social Work Today", Volume 16. He co-authored "Homelessness in Ohio: A Study of People in Need, Franklin County Report", which was published by the Ohio Department of Mental Health. He wrote the book "Zen in your Pocket" about Zen helping with traumatic stress and disability. Roshi Hilbert also wrote Living Zen: The Diary of an American Zen Priest, which details a year in the life of a Zen priest, and what he learned about life from the day-to-day events.

Hannibal Cobb

Hannibal Cobb is an American old-time radio detective drama. It was broadcast on ABC from January 9, 1950 until May 11, 1951.
Format.
Hannibal Cobb was a detective who "took an intense personal interest in those for whom he worked." Described at the beginning of each episode as "... a dramatic story of human conflict vividly told ...", Cobb's adventures were reported from the client's viewpoint. 
In a radio version of counterprogramming, the program was unique in that it was broadcast in the daytime, when competing networks aired soap operas. In a January 6, 1950, article in "The Cincinnati Enquirer", Lane Adams called the scheduling "almost a revolutionary break with hallowed radio precedent."
"Hannibal Cobb" was based on the Photocrime feature that ran in "Look" magazine.
Personnel.
Santos Ortega portrayed Hannibal Cobb, and Les Griffith was the announcer. Producer/directors were Martin Andrews, William D. Hamilton, Roy LaPlante, and Charles Powers. Writers were Bernard Dougall, Louis Heyward, Ira Marion, and Lillian Schoen.
Television.
In 1960, Filmmaster produced a series of 5-minute episodes of a "Hannibal Cobb" series that starred James Craig. The Video International Productions series was expected to have at least 189 episodes.

Early life, education and career.
Raymond J. Crews was born in south Shreveport. His family moved to the Northeast, and he went to high school there.
Crews holds a bachelor's degree in computer science from Texas A&amp;M University.
Crews spent an overall 17 years in the U.S. Air Force, 9 of which in active duty, which included combat operations in Iraq. During 8 years in the Air Force Reserve, where he was a pilot for B-52 bombers, he took part in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
After leaving active duty, Crews became an Airline pilot and flew B-727, DC-9, and A-320 civilian aircraft for 17 years.

Political positions.
Crews is a Christian conservative, with respect to both social and fiscal aspects. He believes in the right to life starting at conception and believes that the United States were founded on the basis of Judeo-Christian principles, of which the Constitutions rights are a result. He supports the view that being an American presupposes the recognition of those rights, the acknowledgement of the inherent dignity and the freedom of religion of each individual. Crews defends the right to bear arms and stands for a strong national security, through the support of U.S. troops, a well-financed military and an improved cyber security infrastructure. Part of his fight for personal freedom is the conviction that a small government with limited tax burdens for the citizens is the best way of promoting a good business climate with quality jobs for his constituency, and also the U.S. as a whole.
Member of the House of Representatives of Louisiana.
Elections.
On April 29, 2017, Crews defeated his competitor Robbie Gatti, the brother of State Senator Ryan Gatti, a Baptist minister and retired physical therapist by a vote of 64 to 36 percent.

He was sworn in by former House District 8 legislator and current Louisiana 26th Judicial Court Judge Jeff R. Thompson. During the event, Crews said that he wanted to be among the "defenders of liberty in the political realm", realizing the great potential of the people and natural resources of Louisiana.
Support.
On February 6, 2017, NORTHPAC, a Political Action Committee (PAC) of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry (LABI) published their endorsement of Crews in his campaign for Louisiana House District 8. NORTHPAC supports candidates who stand for Free market principles.

Only a few days earlier, Crews had also been endorsed by Former Louisiana House of Representatives District 8 candidate Patrick Harrington and Congressman Mike Johnson.
Committees.
Representative Crews is a member of the following Legislative Committees:
Electoral history.

Eschenberg (Kirchdorf im Wald)

The Eschenberg near Kirchdorf im Wald in the Bavarian county of Regen is a mountain, , in the Bavarian Forest.
Location.
The Eschenberg lies in the natural region of the High Black Forest ("Hinterer Bayerischer Wald", No. 403) in the Bavarian Forest Nature Park. Its summit forms the highest point of a rather rarely visited ridge between the village of Kirchdorf im Wald, Rinchnach and Frauenau (all in the county of Regen) as well as Klingenbrunn (in the neighbouring county of Freyung-Grafenau). On its southern flank is the rock formation of "Habichtstein" (863 m).
Description.
A waymarked footpath runs around Eschenberg. At the summit of the mostly wooded mountain the view is very restricted. For many years there was a military observation post, "Fox 2", operated by the Low-Flying Aircraft Reporting and Control Service ("Tieffliegermelde- und Leitdienst") of the Bundeswehr with a transmission mast that was visible from a long way off. After it had been given up the municipality of Kirchdorf planned to renaturalise the 11,500 square metre area, but it was sold in 2003. Eventually the village council agreed a plan to build an observatory on the mountain.
Other nearby summits include the Wagensonnriegel, the Gsengetstein and the Hessenstein.

Amitermes hastatus

Amitermes hastatus, commonly known as the black mound termite, is a species of termite found in the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is endemic to the region's fynbos ecosystem. They build distinctive black termite mounds that range in height from a few centimeters to 50 centimeters. The species is commonly found on sandy soil eroded from white Table Mountain sandstone at altitudes from just under 100 meters up to 900 meters above sea level.
Colony.
The mound is constructed from white sand and organic matter and is distinctively black in colour due to the cement excreted by the termites. The exterior consists of irregular chambers that are interconnected with other cells through small circular openings. The interior of the mound has larger chambers with thinner walls. There is no royal cell in the mound; instead, breading termites move freely though the network of cells at the centre of the mound. The species is not a fungus grower and as such there are no fungus gardens in the mound. The mounds tend to be as high as they are wide and can reach up to 50 centimeters in height and width.
Workers expand the size of the mound from the mound's interior by making small holes in the mound surface from inside and pushing the building material up from the interior.
Description.
Workers range in size from 4mm to 4.5mm in length and have relatively large white heads. Workers can live relatively long lives exceeding nine months. They mostly harvest humus and dead damp organic plant matter for consumption whilst underground, rarely foraging for food on the surface.
Soldiers are larger than workers, ranging in size from 5mm to 5.5mm in length, and they have larger heads that are yellow or red in colour. A large part of the head is taken up by a frontal gland that excretes a colourless, sticky fluid that has a strong irritant effect on other insects. There tends to be one soldier for every twenty to thirty workers. Soldiers rely on workers to feed them.
White nymphs are found in mature mounds older than two or three years old in February and March, and emerge as sexually reproductive alates to undergo mating flights in April or May after the first autumn rains. Queens can reach a length of 15mm and freely move about the centre of the mound. Each mound has multiple kings and queens with up to thirty-five queens in a mound.
Ecology.
The parasites of "Amitermes hastatus" include two species of mites, "Termitacarus cuneiformis" and "Cosmoglyphus kramerii". Another species of termite, "Termes winifredae", often cohabits in very close proximity to "A. hastatus" as an inquiline. "T. winifredae" numbers tend to be small in number and pose little threat to "A. hastatus", with the two species rarely mixing even though their tunnels and chambers might run parallel to each other. Should one of the two species break into the other's colony, they will fight, with "A. hastatus" tending to beat back "T. winifredae". A species of springtail is also known to be a common inhabit of "A. hastatus" nests, and larvae of the fly "Termitometopia skaifei" are found in some nests.
Larger animals such as aardvarks and lizards such as southern rock agamas are known to eat various termite species, including "A. hastatus".

Sido S.1

The Sido S.1 was a Polish two seat, parasol wing trainer aircraft, first flown in 1930.
Design and development.
In the late 1920s the LOPP issued a requirement for a low cost, club trainer. In 1929 the Sido S.1 was designed in response by the amateur Józef Sido, who was a student at the Mining Academy in Kraków. Positive reactions from both LOPP and the Kraków Academic Aeroclub led to the parallel construction of three airframes in the workshops of the local Air Regiment, differing primarily in their engines. The first, powered by a Cirrus III inline, flew for the first time on ether 21 or 28 July 1930. The second airframe flew in September 1930, initially known as the S.2 and fitted with a Avia W.Z.7, a Polish seven cylinder radial engine. The third, initially known as the S.3, had the Cirrus engine but had modified the wing bracing struts and undercarriage. In the late summer of 1931 the two later aircraft were modified to the standards and engine of the S.1 and were referred to by that designation.
The wooden parasol wing of the Sido S.1 was built in two parts. Each had two spars, plywood skinned leading edges and was fabric covered. In plan the wing was straight tapered and its section varied outboard from S.T.Ae 74 to Göttingen Gö 398. Each halfwing was joined to the lower fuselage longerons with V-struts to the spars and the centre section, formed from the fuel tank, was held well above the fuselage on steel tube struts to the upper fuselage.
Its flat-sided fuselage was built around a steel tube structure and fabric covered apart from plywood decking. There were two open, tandem cockpits equipped with dual control. The upward field of view from the rear cockpit was improved with a wide, rounded, trailing edge cut-out and access to the front cockpit with a starboard-side door. The S.1 had a triangular fin and a large rudder with a leading edge that extended the straight edge of the fin but with a full, rounded trailing edge down to the keel. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, strut braced from below, and the elevators had a cut-out for rudder movement.
The S.1 had conventional, fixed landing gear. Each maninwheel was on a half-axle hinged from the lower fuselage longeron, as was the radius arm. The landing leg, which incorporated a compressed rubber shock absorber, was hinged from the upper longeron.
Operational history.
The Polish military aviation authorities considered the S.1 alongside the PZL.5 and the M.N.5 for their trainer requirements. Despite its good performance, the lack of an established manufacturing facility for this amateur design prevented its military adoption. There was more enthusiasm from the civilian aeroclubs and a series of five airframes, designated S.1bis Z, powered by the Avia engine in a Townend ring cowling and fitted with streamlined wing struts, was begun in the newly established Central Aeroclubs' Workshops (C.W.A.). C.W.A went bankrupt after producing only three, the last of which had a Siemens-Halske Sh 11 radial.
The S.1s was a frequent competitor in Polish meetings, including the National Lightplane Contests and many local and regional meetings and rallies through the early 1930s, though without major successes. It also served as a reliable and forgiving club trainer, the small production numbers reflecting the failure to find an established constructor for the aircraft rather than its qualities. One remained in use until 1939 and may have been evacuated to Romania.

Gray's pipefish, also known as the mud pipefish or spiny pipefish ("Halicampus grayi") is a species of marine fish of the family Syngnathidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific in the Gulf of Aden, Sri Lanka, and from the Gulf of Thailand to Japan, the Marshall Islands, and the Great Barrier Reef. It lives to depth of , and planktonic juveniles have been found above depths of . It occurs in muddy habitats, in estuaries, and on coral reefs, where it likely feeds on small crustaceans. It can grow to lengths of . This species is ovoviviparous, with males carrying eggs in a brood pouch before giving birth to live young.
"H. grayi" is brownish with dark bars along the side of its body, and pale bars on the gill membrane. This colouring provides extremely good camouflage for muddy and silty habitats, where the species will cover itself to stay hidden.

Plot summary.
The story is narrated in the first-person by Doctor Horace Bianchon. A young married society woman, Madame de Listomère briefly meets Eugène de Rastignac at a social gathering. The next day he writes a letter to his lover, Madame de Nucingen, but mistakenly addresses it to Madame de Listomère. When Madame de Listomère reads this letter she is scandalised. Rastignac only realises his mistake four days later, and it is confirmed to him by his friend, Horace Bianchon, who saw him writing the letter when he was visiting him.

The hospital was founded by Isaac Buxton in 1814 as the Infirmary for Asthma, Consumption and other Pulmonary Diseases. At first it had only eight beds and Buxton was its only physician for the first six years of its existence. It was located in Union Street, Spitalfields, before moving to City Road in 1849. It became the Royal Infirmary for Diseases of the Chest in 1859 shortly before the structure was rebuilt in 1862. It became the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest in 1867 and the Royal Chest Hospital in 1919. It amalgamated with the Royal Northern Hospital and, following damage from bombing sustained during the Second World War, it joined the National Health Service in 1948. It closed in 1954 and the building has since been demolished.

SS Iosco

Iosco (Official number 100484) was a Great Lakes freighter that served on the Great Lakes from her construction in 1891 to her foundering on September 2, 1905, when she and her tow, the schooner barge "Olive Jeanette" sank on Lake Superior. While "Olive Jeanette" wreck was located in over of water about off the Huron Islands in the 1990s, "Iosco" wreck has not yet been found.
History.
"Iosco" built by the West Bay City Shipbuilding Company (F.W. Wheeler Shipyards) of West Bay City, Michigan. She was named after Iosco County, which is a county in Michigan. She was one of three almost identical wooden ships including , , , and . She was launched on April 25, 1891, as hull number #80. She had a large white oak hull.
At an overall length of , "Iosco" was one of the largest wooden ships ever built. Her hull was between her perpendiculars, her beam was wide, and her cargo hold was deep. Because of her enormous size "Iosco" needed several steel arches, a steel keelson, steel cross bracing and several steel plates to increase her strength. "Iosco" had a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine that was built by the Frontier Engine Works Company of Detroit, Michigan. Her massive triple expansion steam engine was capable of generating , her engine had cylinders of , each with a stroke. She had two coal burning Scotch marine boilers that were high and wide. They also had a steam pressure of ; her boilers were built by the Wickes Brothers of Saginaw, Michigan.
Sinking.
A September 6, 1905 issue of the Daily News Marshall, Michigan wrote an article about the foundering of "Iosco" and "Olive Jeanette":
"Life preservers marked Iosco and much other wreckage were found near Huron Island." "The stem of a schooner had been thrown up on the end of Point Abbaye." "The body of a sailor was found ten miles this side of Point Abbaye." 
"It is now believed that both the Iosco and the schooner Olive Jeannette, which the "Iosco" had in tow, foundered in the vicinity where the wreckage had been sighted." "It is certain that the Olive Jeanette is lost."
"The lighthouse keeper on Huron Island plainly saw a big schooner founder four miles north of the light at 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon." "No steamer was in sight at the time." "The schooner when first sighted had jib and foresail set, and was nearly waterlogged." "Not long afterward the ship went down." "The lighthouse keeper had no means of rendering assistance in the tremendous sea running."
"The three days which have elapsed since the Olive Jeannette foundered would have brought news from the Iosco were that boat still afloat, but the owners at Cleveland last night gave up hope."
"The Iosco carried a crew of nineteen men. The Olive Jeannette carried a crew of seven men."
"The Iosco and Jeannette, laden with iron ore, left Duluth at noon last Thursday bound for Lake Erie."
"They were caught by the storm when halfway down Lake Superior, and must have been driven back with the hope of finding shelter among the islands east of Keweenaw Peninsula."
"The Iosco was commanded by Captain Nelson Gonyaw.""

Po sekretu vsemu svetu

Po secretu vsemu svetu, "In secret to the whole world", is a 1976 Soviet two-part television film produced by Belarusfilm. It is adapted from Victor Dragunsky's popular children's book "The Adventures of Dennis", a collection of short stories told from the perspective of a young boy.
Plot.
The movie is about a boy named Denis and his adventures with friends and family. It is divided into two episodes, each in turn covering several stories from the book.
Filming.
It was filmed in Minsk, Belarus for 7 months. The school hallway scenes were filmed at school number 115 and the episode when Mishka tells Denis what he loves and when Levka gives Dennis a sleeve was filmed at school 122 in Minsk. The classroom scenes were filmed in the studio.The train scenes were filmed on an inoperative railway line in the Smolevichi region. The train consisted of a locomotive and three carriages. The tower that Dennis was afraid to jump from was filmed in Smolevchi. Vladimir's regular dark blond hair was painted with hydrogen peroxide which caused it to become a lighter shade of blond in the film. During the scenes where Dennis cries, Vladimir said that "glycerin was instilled on the set. The eyes immediately began to pinch, and tears appeared. True, once they were real. The director took the football tickets away from me, and I cried with resentment. The stage was filmed and the tickets were given to me." Georgy fondly recalls that"The assistants came to school and took me out of school, it was such happiness!". Vladimir Stankevich said that Georgy,"stuttered for real, and they wanted him to take a stunt double for voice acting, but when he tried to voice himself, he stuttered exactly in the same places as during the filming."

Fleurs de Marécage

Fleurs de Marécage (Dutch subtitle "Moerasbloemen", Dutch for "Swamp Flowers") is a collection of French poems by Dutch poet J. Slauerhoff, first published in 1929. Some are poems originally written in French, others are French translations by the poet of his originally Dutch poems.
Publication history and content.
The first edition was printed by A. A. M. Stols in Brussels. Stols was a prolific publisher in the 1920s, and E. du Perron worked for him in the late 1920s. Du Perron was interested in becoming a publisher of poetry in limited editions via subscriptions, and he edited and then published the second edition of "Fleurs" in the same year, with "Chaumont-Gistoux" listed as the publisher--Gistoux is the name of the Belgian town where du Perron lived, and in 1929 Slauerhoff stayed there with him. This edition was published as "Fleurs de marécage. Poèmes de J. Slauerhoff. Précédés d'une lettre de Franz Hellens". The third was published in 1934, again by Stols, now in Maastricht. The fourth edition, published by Nijgh &amp; Van Ditmar in The Hague in 1986, contained the Dutch originals for those poems translated into French by Slauerhoff, and translations of his original French poems by Hans van Straten.
Seven of the original French poems with translations by van Straten were published in 1986 in the Dutch literary magazine "De Tweede Ronde". One poem ("Le galérien") was translated into Dutch by Slauerhoff himself (as "Op de galeien"), and one ("Imprudence") is a translation/adaptation into French by Slauerhoff of "The Mermaid", a poem by the Irish poet W. B. Yeats.
Themes.
According to Johann Lodewyk Marais, the importance of French symbolism became especially prominent in Slauerhoff's with the publication of "Fleurs de Marécage", a collection which leans on that symbolism and particularly on Charles Baudelaire's "Les Fleurs du mal". Marais cites a study by Van der Paardt, who argues that Slauerhoff has a profound distaste of visible, rationally comprehensible reality and attempts to seek the more absolute, ideal reality behind the visible one: Slauerhoff attempts to escape earthly limitations of time and space, and to develop a symbolic poetic which expresses the inexpressible.
A recurring theme in Slauerhoff's work is Macau; it is the setting of his 1931 novel "Het verboden rijk", in which Luís de Camões was one of the two protagonists. "Oost-Azië"s "Macao" section is dedicated to Constâncio José da Silva, an important Macanese newspaper editor. From that collection, Slauerhoff translated two of those "Macao" poems, and a poem about a Portuguese fort in Asia, for "Fleurs de Marécage".

Dana Awartani

Dana Awartani (born 1987) is a Palestinian-Saudi artist born and raised in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia where she lives and works today.
Education.
Awartani graduated with a bachelor's degree in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins, London. She then received a Master's in Traditional Arts from The Prince's School, London. At The Prince’s School she learned how to work in stained glass, miniature painting, and gilding - various traditional techniques from cultures all over the world. However, she couldn’t gain a degree in the traditional illumination of texts there, so she found an instructor in Turkey to help her to master this discipline.
Work.
Awartani employs a variety of media in her work, including painting, video and sand mosaics. Her work is unique in that it seeks to incorporate the traditional methods of Islamic art into a contemporary world. Rich in geometric patterning and the most intricate of details, Dana’s work often integrates the patterning styles of Islamic art. Specialising in geometry as well as illumination, tile-work and parquetry, Awartani's work explores the relationship between geometry and nature, as well as how truths can be translated through art using geometric principles, visualising a sacred language through a symbolic and multi-layered aesthetic. Her method that emerged over 1,000 years ago as a substitute for the forbidden depiction of divine figures. It is still being practiced, although less and less, today, by specialists such as Dana. 
On Arabs and art Dana said: ″As Arabs we’re raised around this fine art, we’re surrounded by it in every corner but we’re not aware of it. You can see geometry all around you like in mosques for example. I was looking for a track to follow and looking deep down inside I felt a yearning for it until I’ve discovered it. There is an inner and outer beauty behind it telling a story behind every structured piece, there is no randomness when it comes to creating such pieces.″ On the Islamic art, she said: ″Islamic Art is firstly not made for the sake of making art. It is a sacred spiritual practice that is used as a way to worship God and for God. It teaches one sabr (patience) and respect and as an Islamic artist, my work is a form of prayer and dhikr (remembrance). I need to be 100% focused and in a good mood to be able to do it, otherwise it doesn’t work."

Frank Werber

Frank Nicholas Werber (March 27, 1929 – May 19, 2007) was a German-born American talent manager, restaurant owner and entrepreneur, who was particularly influential as the discoverer, manager and producer of The Kingston Trio in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Life and career.
Werber was born in Cologne, Germany, but moved with his parents as a young child to escape the Nazi regime, first to the Netherlands and then Belgium. His mother died, and after the start of World War II he and his father were captured and interned in Vichy France. They managed to escape, and fled to Africa and then to New York, arriving in 1941. They lived in Florida and then in Denver, Colorado, and after graduating Frank joined the US Navy. After visiting San Francisco on a tour of duty, he returned to live there in 1950 after his discharge.
He worked at a wide variety of jobs, including for some time as a photographer for United Press, but became involved with the local nightclub scene and in the early 1950s became stage manager under Enrico Banducci at the hungry i nightclub. After four years working at the club, and developing contacts in the entertainment business, he set up as an independent press agent. In early 1957 he saw Dave Guard and his informal group the Calypsonians perform at the Cracked Pot club in Redwood City, and decided to work with them. 
Changes in personnel left a trio of Guard, Nick Reynolds and Bob Shane, with Werber as their manager and effective fourth member. Werber professionalized the group, and improved their stage presentation. The group grew in popularity, signing to Capitol Records, and began a succession of best-selling recordings. Werber closely managed their career and their investments through various personnel changes, until the Trio split up in 1967. As the Kingston Trio's manager, Werber is credited with designing the basic hospitality rider concerning the environment in which musicians perform; and also with transforming "what had been the college lecture circuit and turned it into the college concert circuit".
Werber also managed other folk-oriented, jazz and rock groups including The Journeymen, We Five, The Sons of Champlin and The Mystery Trend. He set up Trident Productions; developed a recording studio, Columbus Studios, in the Columbus Tower; and established the successful restaurant, The Trident, described as "a psychedelic health food restaurant with hanging plants and handmade candles where rock musicians hung out and ogled braless waitresses", in Sausalito. In 1967 he gave up his music business interests to concentrate on the restaurant and other investments. The following year federal agents raided his home and seized 258 pounds of marijuana, which he was accused of conspiring to transport. He was found not guilty, but was then tried for possession and cultivation of marijuana, for which he was found guilty and served a short jail sentence.
In 1974 he started to give up most of his San Francisco business interests, moved for a time to Hawaii and then retired to a ranch in Silver City, New Mexico. He suffered a stroke several years before his death in 2007. He had married twice, and had five children.

Since 1973 Maehder has been working in European opera houses as producer, first as assistant director at Hamburg State Opera and at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. During the 1980s he worked mostly in Italy, often in collaboration with Sylvano Bussotti. Since the 1970s Maehder has published numerous musicological articles in the program books of internationally renowned opera houses, first for the Bavarian State Opera in Munich and for Bayreuth Festival, in the 1980s for the Paris Opera, the Teatro alla Scala in Milan and the Teatro La Fenice ín Venice, the Vienna State Opera and the State Operas in Berlin. Since 1992 he has regularly collaborated with Salzburg Festival on their program books; he also worked as the festival's dramaturg in 2002. In 1996 he directed a staging of Verdi's "Rigoletto" at the Hawai'i Opera Theatre in Honolulu.
Musicological research.
In 1978 Maehder discovered Franco Alfano's original version of the finale for act 3 of Puccini's "Turandot"; since 1982 his version has been widely performed by opera houses worldwide (London, Barbican Hall 1982; New York City Opera 1983; Rome, Terme di Caracalla, 1985; Bonn Opera House 1985 etc.). His international conferences on Giacomo Puccini in 1983 (Torre del Lago) and 1984 (Torre del Lago; Ravenna) marked the beginning of serious musicological as well as philological research in the field of Italian fin-de-siècle opera.
Maehder has organized international conferences on Giacomo Puccini, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Giuseppe Verdi, Richard Wagner and Gaspare Spontini, Bohuslav Martinů and Sylvano Bussotti, on libretto history and the methodology of opera research in Italy (Torre del Lago 1983 e 1984; Ravenna 1984; Villa Vigoni, Loveno di Menaggio/CO 1993; Maiolati Spontini/AN 2007, Roma 2016), in Germany (Bad Homburg 1987; Berlin 2000; Berlin 2001; Leipzig 2004; Münster 2006), in Switzerland (Fondo Leoncavallo, Locarno/TI 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998; 2006), in Austria (Bregenz 2002; Salzburg 2002), in the Czech Republic (Praha 2000), in Russia (St. Petersburg 1994), in the Republic of China/Taiwan (Taipei, 2005; Taipei 2006; Taipei 2008; Taipei 2013). He gave papers in numerous international conferences in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, the Czech Republic, in Russia, Japan, in the Republic of China/Taiwan and the United States. Jürgen Maehder has given numerous guest lectures in Europe, Asia, the US and the Pacific region.
His research interests include the history of orchestration and timbre composition; the comparative history of 19th- and 20th-century opera in Italy, France and Germany; a comparative history of the opera libretto; 20th-century music, especially music theatre after 1950; the history of opera staging; and the aesthetics of music.
Since 1994 Maehder has published a series of musicological monographs under the title "Perspektiven der Opernforschung" in collaboration with Thomas Betzwieser. Together with his wife, the Taiwanese musicologist Kii-Ming Lo, he has published several musicological monographs in Chinese.

Battle of the Strait of Hormuz (1553)

The Battle of the Strait of Hormuz was fought in August 1553 between an Ottoman fleet, commanded by Admiral Murat Reis, against a Portuguese fleet of Dom Diogo de Noronha. The Turks were forced to retreat after clashing with the Portuguese.
Background.
After Piri Reis was executed in late 1552, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent had him replaced by Murat Reis, as Ottoman "admiral of the Indian Ocean fleet". His mission was to transfer 15 galleys stationed at Basra to the Red Sea, to firmly secure it against Portuguese incursions. Such a task however, demanded sailing through the Persian Gulf, closely watched and heavily guarded by the Portuguese from their base at Hormuz.
Piri Reis' attack on Muscat and Hormuz the previous year had triggered a Portuguese response from Goa, in the form of 30 galleons and caravels, 70 oar ships, and 3,000 soldiers commanded by the Viceroy himself, Dom Afonso de Noronha. These forces were eventually not needed, but nonetheless, significant reinforcements were detached to secure Hormuz against possible Ottoman attacks in the near future. The Portuguese captain of Hormuz was then Dom António de Noronha, while the sea-captain of Hormuz was Dom Diogo de Noronha. Dom Diogo was joined by the flotilla of Dom Pedro de Ataíde, who had just returned from blockading the mouth of the Red Sea that year.
In May 1553, Dom Diogo set out to sea to patrol the vicinity of Cape Musandam with his main force, while two small craft were dispatched to scout the Shatt al-Arab for Ottoman movements. A few months later, the two craft returned, with information that Murat Reis had departed Basra with 16 vessels and followed close behind, on his way towards the Strait of Hormuz.
The battle.
The Turks sailed in a column close to shore, and as soon as they spotted the Portuguese fleet, attempted to circle it around the north. To allow the galleons and war-caravels to fire broadsides, the Portuguese formed a line – a tactic that in the future would become standard in naval warfare. Murat Reis proved just as skilful commanding his galleys: lacking broadside artillery, he instead would order all his galleys to veer to starboard at the same time, to allow the bow guns to fire at the Portuguese, before resuming course. One Turkish cannonball pierced the Portuguese flagship below the waterline; at this critical moment, the ship-master performed a risky manoeuvre: shifting direction towards the wind, the galleon tilted, bringing the hole above the waterline and allowing the carpenters to plug it mid-battle.
Towards the end of the morning wind fell, leaving the Portuguese and Ottoman sail vessels immobile, but not the galleys. Possessing himself a carrack which he could not leave behind, Murat Reis took the opportunity to surround an isolated Portuguese galleon, commanded by Gonçalo Pereira Marramaque. For the following six hours, the galleon crew withstood a continuous bombardment, felling its masts and tearing down its fore and aft castles. Yet the Turks were unable to sink it through gunfire alone, or close in for the grapple. At the same time, the Turkish galleys were harassed by the Portuguese foists, which being lighter, did not press with the attack.
As the wind picked up, the Portuguese galleons and war-caravels once more closed in on the Turkish galleys, and Murat Reis finally disengaged, taking the route back to Basra along the Persian coast.
Aftermath.
Coming aboard the battered galleon, Dom Diogo de Noronha applauded its crew for their brave resistance – congratulating the commanding officers last, declaring that they had not but done their duty as expected of nobility of their rank.
Gonçalo Pereira Marramaque was towed back to Hormuz by a few oarships, while Dom Diogo de Noronha set out in pursuit of the Turkish galleys. Since wind blew weak, Murat Reis gained a considerable lead and managed to reach Basra safely within seven days, and Dom Diogo likewise returned to Hormuz and Goa, leaving just a few craft keeping watch at the mouth of the Shatt al Arab.
Following this setback, Murat Reis was dismissed of his command, and replaced with Seydi Ali Reis, who would likewise attempt an incursion across the Persian Gulf the following year.

The Inventor Crazybrains and His Wonderful Airship

Le Dirigeable fantastique ou le Cauchemar d'un inventeur, released in the US as The Inventor Crazybrains and His Wonderful Airship and in the UK as Fantastical Air Ship, is a 1905 French short silent film directed by Georges Méliès. The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 786–788 in its catalogues. 
Plot.
In his ramshackle lodgings, decorated with designs of famous airships of the past, the inventor Crazybrains dances with glee at having designed a new dirigible. When he takes a nap, impish figures appear in his room, gleefully wreaking havoc with his papers before giving way to a vision of Crazybrains's new airship rising aloft above the rooftops. The airship travels through the clouds, and women reclining in painterly positions appear in the sky. Suddenly a fireball strikes the airship, and it explodes with much fire and smoke as the impish figures reappear. Crazybrains, waking up from his nightmare, tears around his room in a frenzy, knocking the plans for the airship down to the floor.
Themes.
"Le Dirigeable fantastique" is one of numerous Méliès films, like "A Trip to the Moon" and "The Impossible Voyage", featuring a comically eccentric scientist. As featured by Méliès, the character is connected both to the Faust legend (a favourite theme of the filmmaker's) as well as to the long-lasting film tradition of the mad scientist figure. Similarly parodic depictions of scientific practitioners also feature in other early films, such as the Edison Manufacturing Company's 1910 "A Trip to Mars".
Release and survival.
A hand-coloured print of the film, probably from Elisabeth Thuillier's colouring laboratory, survives at the EYE Film Institute Netherlands. It was given a restoration in 1991.

This is Love is a podcast created by Phoebe Judge, Lauren Spohrer, and Nadia Wilson, producers of "Criminal". The series investigates stories of love.
The team started to work on the production of "This is Love" in Fall 2017. The six-episode first season launched in February 2018, on Valentine's Day. Season two started in November 2018, and the third season in May 2019.
Julienne Alexander makes original illustrations for each episode of "This is Love."
Critical reception.
"The Guardian" described "This is Love" as "beautifully paced, with memorable details." "USA Today" wrote, "Like "Criminal", "This Is Love" is a careful combination of interviews, music and Judge's narration that makes for a seamless and satisfying listening experience. But the new show has a different tone: It's warmer." "New York Magazine" said "Fans should expect the team to apply the same expansive, thoughtful, and near-anthropological approach to the lighter subject of love." "Refinery29" called it a "warm, story-based podcast to listen to when the news is too much to bear." "Entertainment Tonight" called it "an intriguing must-listen."

Chatham Manufacturing Company

Chatham Manufacturing Company is an American textile brand founded in 1877 that has made automobile upholstery, jeans, and flannels. Its most famous product is the Chatham Blanket. It was the largest blanket manufacturer in the world at its height.
History.
Alexander Chatham went to work as a clerk at the Gwyn Mill in 1858. Richard Gwyn built the grist mill along the Elkin Creek in Elkin North Carolina. It was powered by water from the creek and local farmers brought their corn to him to be ground into flour. The mill had a store and was a focal point for trade in the area. Cash was scarce in the area after the Civil War and sheep were abundant, so wool became the most common currency in the local barter economy. The Gwyn Mill had to accept wool in trade, cart it 60 miles away in order to sell the raw fiber which was then sent by rail to distant mills. The amount of wool being traded continued to increase so much that in the 1870s, the company bought a wool carding machine in order to process the wool. It was installed in the grist mill and powered by the same water wheel. This, in turn, brought in more wool from the mountains of North Carolina and the surrounding area. In 1877, Richard Gwyn and Alexander Chatham took over operation of the mill. They added a textile mill to the grist and carding mill and named the operation the “Elkin Valley Woolen Mill”. In the first years of the woolen mill operation, it employed only four people. In 1878, Gwyn and Chatham travelled to Philadelphia and recruited a machinist, Gilvin T Roth.
In 1890 the railroad arrived in Elkin. The North Carolina Railroad ran along the Yadkin River, and Gwyn and Chatham quickly made plans to move their factory to be alongside it. That same year, Thomas Gwyn sold his interest to Alexander Chatham and the company was renamed the Chatham Manufacturing Company. The new mill no longer needed water power, but instead used steam engines to power generators. The mill made only yarn until 1893 when they began to produce fabrics as well. That was the year that they made the first Chatham Blanket. In 1895 the company started making wool suiting fabric and brought a tailor from New York to make suits.
In 1907 the Chatham Manufacturing company reorganized. They built another factory in Winston-Salem. Alexander's son, Hugh Gwyn Chatham became the president, with R J Reynolds as the vice president. In 1916 Elkin flooded, including the Chatham Manufacturing Company. The flood was devastating to the mill, and the company began work on a new mill on higher ground above the old one. 
In 1929, Richard Thurmond Chatham took over the company from his father, Hugh Gwyn Chatham. He entered Chatham Manufacturing into the automotive upholstery business in 1936 with interiors for Packard. In 1939 the company moved its Winston-Salem Factory to Elkin to have everything in a single Place. Richard Thurmond Chatham was a naval officer and commanded a cruiser, the USS Phoenix, during World War 2. While he was at sea, the company produced blankets for the armed forces and was awarded the Army/ Navy Award of Excellence for wartime production.
In 1955, Hugh G. Chatham II, the older of R.T. Chatham’s two sons, became president.
In 1970, Richard T. Chatham Jr. succeeded his brother as president. 
Chatham Blankets.
In 1893 Chatham wove its first blanket. The first dozen were bound on a sewing machine by Mrs RL Hubbard. Although Chatham manufactured fabrics for many applications, Chatham Blankets were the only product with the name "Chatham" on them and the thing that the company would be most known for. During the first part of the 19th century, the primary focus of company sales were wool blankets. The Chatham Blanket became famous all over the United States. Wool blankets are soft, warm and naturally moisture wicking. The Chatham blanket process started with local, North Carolina Wool. The raw wool was washed in water from the Yadkin River and then carded to align the fibers. The carded wool was spun into threads and dyed. The wool threads were then warped and woven into cloth. The cloth was then napped and washed, then cut to size and bound. The finished blankets were warm in winter, breathable in summer, moisture wicking and self cleaning. 
Around 1910, Chatham was the largest blanket manufacturer in the South, and by the 1940s and 1950s, they were the largest blanket manufacturer in the world. They manufactured millions of blankets for all branches of the armed forces in both world wars. The company was awarded the Army/ Navy Award of Excellence for wartime production for its military blankets.
Automotive Upholstery.
In the 1930s the company started producing automotive upholstery. Studebaker, Packard, and Ford were among their automotive clients. The company built a finishing plant for Upholstery in Winston-Salem, NC but eventually moved it to Elkin to adjoin their main plant. Chatham designed the interior of the 1947 Studebaker Starlight designed by Raymond Loewy. They worked with famed textile designer Marianne Strengell on designs for automotive textiles.
Chatham Blanketeers.
Chatham Manufacturing organized a semi-professional baseball team called the Chatham Blanketeers. They represented North Carolina at The National Semi-Pro Baseball Tournament in Wichita, Kan., in 1937. The team won the North Carolina semi-pro championship in Asheboro in 1948 and in 1949 they went to the National Baseball Congress World Series.
Turmoil.
In the late 1980s, Chatham Manufacturing owned plants in Elkin, Eden, and Charlotte. About two-thirds of the company's more than $125 million in sales in 1987 derived from upholstery products, while most of the rest of the company's revenues were from the sale of bedding products, including blankets. A majority of the company's stock was still owned by descendants of Alexander Chatham. However, in 1988, Northern Feather, Ltd., a Danish textile maker, outbid family members and senior management for control of Chatham Manufacturing and purchased the blanket-maker for more than $92 million. This ended the company's more than 110 years of North Carolina ownership. Northern Feather went bankrupt within four years, however, and Chatham Manufacturing was sold to CMI Industries of Columbia, S.C., in 1992. In 2000 Atlanta-based Interface, Inc., acquired the firm from CMI Industries, and, as Chatham, Inc., it became part of the Interface Fabrics Group, with a focus on upholstery for commercial and residential uses.
Ownership.
A new version of the brand's classic blanket was launched on Kickstarter by Alex Chatham, of New York, NY, Industrial Designer and the great-great-grandson of the original founder.

Wine Country (film)

Wine Country is a 2019 American comedy film produced and directed by Amy Poehler, in her feature directorial debut. It was written by Emily Spivey and Liz Cackowski. Its story follows a group of long time friends who take a vacation to Napa Valley as a birthday getaway. It stars Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, Paula Pell, Emily Spivey, Jason Schwartzman, and Tina Fey. The film was released in select theaters on May 8, 2019, and digitally released for streaming on May 10, 2019, by Netflix.
Plot.
Abby (Amy Poehler) decides to celebrate her friend Rebecca's (Rachel Dratch) 50th birthday with a weekend getaway over Rebecca's protests that she wants a low-key celebration. Abby, Rebecca and four of their friends, whom they have known since they were young waitresses, decide to spend the weekend together in Napa.
Rather than allow the women to relax and drink Abby wants them to adhere to a strict schedule, a way of seizing control as, unbeknownst to the rest of her friends, she has recently lost her job. All the other friends are struggling with problems of their own: Rebecca is in denial that her husband is inattentive and her friends hate him, Naomi (Maya Rudolph) is afraid of receiving test results from her doctor, successful business woman Catherine (Ana Gasteyer) feels that the rest of the friends are cutting her out, Val (Paula Pell) is looking for love and Jenny (Emily Spivey) a depressive writer, is simply miserable in life.
On Friday the friends eat at an expensive restaurant where Val flirts with their waitress, Jade.
The following morning the women have a sinister tarot reading from a woman called Lady Sunshine. Afterwards they go day drinking around Napa. Near the end of their tour there is tension when Abby snaps at the other women for not adhering to their schedule. When Rebecca goes to talk to her about her attitude Abby reveals that she lost her job. In anger Abby throws out her schedule and the women decide to go to Jade's art gallery opening.
They are shocked that Jade's art is all related to "The Nanny". During a Q&amp;A Abby rants on how younger generations have it too easy but ends her speech by saying that they are Fran Fine (in reference to Fran Drescher's character on the show "The Nanny") causing the art goers to believe she is a part of the exhibit. Val stays behind to flirt with Jade but when she tries to ask her out Jade assumes she is trying to buy a painting and humiliated, Val agrees to buy it.
Returning home drunk and miserable Abby is propositioned by Devon the housekeeper (Jason Schwartzman) and has sex with him.
The next morning Naomi goes to wish Rebecca a happy birthday and finds her on the floor having thrown out her back. Rebecca reveals that spending the night on the floor led to the epiphany that she hates her life. She agrees to adhere to Abby's schedule and all the women, except Catherine who they can't find, go to brunch. Catherine eventually arrives and accuses the other women of trying to cut her out. Naomi tells her she is locked in a self-fulfilling prophecy as work means she has no time for her friends and not spending more time with her friends makes her work harder. Naomi then reveals she also has problems as she is waiting on the results of a BRCA1 and BRCA2 test and then storms out of the restaurant. After Rebecca tells Abby that the birthday weekend is more for her than for Rebecca, Abby storms out as well.
Naomi and Abby are pursued by the rest of the women in a golf cart. Naomi is bitten on the ankle by a snake and as they can't get cell phone reception Val decides to run down the side of the steep hill they are on to get help. One by one the other women follow Val down the side of the hill. Catherine is the last one to go and gives an emotional speech at the top of the hill about why she is planning to turn down a lucrative job opportunity to spend more time with her friends, a speech that they don't hear.
Arriving at the hospital, they learn that Naomi is fine. Catherine also calls the doctor for her and learns Naomi's blood tests came back negative.
That night, the women sit around drinking and invite the lonely local owner of the house they are staying in, Tammy (Tina Fey), to join them.

Richard Hodgson-Huntley

Richard Hodgson-Huntley, also known as Richard Hodgson until 1870, (1 April 1812 – 22 December 1877) was a British Conservative Party politician and railway entrepreneur.
Family.
Known as Hodgson at the time, Hodgson-Huntley was the second son of John Hodgson and Sarah, daughter of Richard Huntley. He married Catherine Moneypenny, daughter of Anthony Compton. They had at least one child: Katherine Isabella.
Political career.
The then-Hodgson was elected a protectionist Conservative MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1837. He held the seat until 1847 when he stood down in order to contest Newcastle upon Tyne, a seat his brother, John Hodgson, was retiring from; he was unsuccessful.
Hodgson returned to Berwick-upon-Tweed to contest the 1852 general election and by-elections in 1853 and 1859 but failed to recapture the seat.
He later returned to parliament for Tynemouth and North Shields, elected at the by-election in 1861 and holding the seat until 1865 when he was defeated.
Railways.
From 1855 to 1866, Hodgson-Huntley was the chairman of the North British Railway Board of Directors. He joined at a time of particular financial discordance, after former chairman John Learmonth had invested heavily in subscriptions to other railways, with huge sums being written off in failed ventures, and similar sized sums were being sought for new ones.
Hodgson-Huntley's reign saw the company's financial position significantly improved and, within one year of his chairmanship beginning, operating expenses were cut to 44% and he announced the company was free from debt, and a dividend of 2.5% to shareholders. Although the company's dividends varied during his chairmanship – such as in 1862 when capital commitments again swamped the company's financial resources – they regularly hit up to 3%.
Yet, twice in 1866, he proposed a 3% dividend on ordinary shares, only for the share price to decline. On the second occasion, a new company secretary, John Walker, alerted the finance committee to poor company finances. A new preference share issue had been flopped, and it was impossible to pay debenture interest and preference share-guaranteed dividends. This revelation saw ordinary shares fall in value by 8% overnight, and widespread financial impropriety and falsification accounts were blamed on Hodgson, causing a special general meeting on 14 November 1866. Hodgson decided not to attend, instead tendering his resignation from the board, while blaming his non-attendance on a headache.
Other activities.
He also chaired the Tweed Commissions, and a Justice of the Peace for Northumberland. In 1877, until his death, he was High Sheriff of Northumberland.

McLoughlin v. Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons Co.

McLoughlin v. Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons Co., 191 U.S. 267 (1903), was a United States Supreme Court ruling dealing with copyright. It dealt with the interpretation of Section 4963 of the Revised Statutes of the United States before and after the pertinent section's amendment in 1897.
Background.
Originally, Section 4963 forbade any person from stamping a work as copyrighted while not holding the pertinent copyright. The section included a $50 bounty for the person who identified the illicit article and sued, with another $50 going to the government, paid by the printer of the material.
On 3 March 1897, the section was amended to also specifically forbid knowingly selling or importing articles falsely stamped as copyrighted in the United States, whether or not the article was subject to copyright in the United States at all. Importantly, the amendment also noted that these new rules did not apply to articles brought into the country before the amendment's adoption, preventing "ex post facto" law and observing Article 1, of the Constitution.
The case dealt with 83 books and pamphlets with false copyright marks that had been printed outside the United States, identified by the plaintiff, James McLoughlin. McLoughlin was suing for Section 4963's bounty. The defendants, Raphael Tuck and Sons Co., admitted that the marks were false, but proved that the articles in question had been imported before the 1897 amendment to Section 4963. Because the amendment provided immunity to articles imported before its inaction, the lower courts ruled in the defendants' favor. Appeals eventually moved the case to the Supreme Court.
Opinion of the Court.
The lower court's rulings in favor of the defendant were affirmed by the Supreme Court. The Court questioned the quality of certain testimony in the case, but did not consider that relevant to the statutory question.
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. did not hear this argument and was not party to the decision.

Robert Randall (photographer)

Robert Shelby Randall Jr. (December 17, 1918 – September 19, 1984) was an American photographer. He was noted for his fashion photography for the French edition of "Vogue" magazine in the 1950s, and subsequently for his assignments for American magazines such as "Glamour, Seventeen, Look, Good Housekeeping, Harper's Bazaar" and "Cosmopolitan".
Early life.
Randall was born in Miracle Mile, Los Angeles in 1918, the elder son of Robert Shelby Randall (Senior) and Bernadette Fitzgerald. He attended Beverly Hills High School.
Career.
After graduating from high school, Randall worked in the photography studios of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and is reported to have appeared as an extra in some of the films of John Ford.
During the Second World War he served as a US Navy photographer, and was trained by "Life" magazine to take combat pictures. He attained the rank of Photographer's Mate 1st Class Petty Officer.
After the war, he moved to Paris, France, where he secured a job at Condé Nast, publisher of "Vogue" magazine, with whom he was employed for seven years. In the early 1950s, he became noted for his fashion photography for the French edition of "Vogue". His "Los Angeles Times" obituary would later remark that "photographing his models in the back streets of war-torn Paris, against centuries-old facades, Randall brought a new look to high fashion and created celebrities of the models." After seven years in Paris, he returned to the United States and was based in New York City for 15 years, where he had his own studio on Park Avenue.
In 1968, he moved from New York to Laguna Beach, California, where he worked on a semi-retired basis. In the 1970s, exhibitions of his work were held at the Edward-Dean Museum of Decorative Arts and the Laguna Beach Museum of Art. According to newspaper interviews at the time, he was preparing a book of photographs of Laguna residents; however, it appears this projected work was never published.
In 1975, he started teaching photography courses through the University of California, Irvine, and at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.
In 1977, the "Los Angeles Times" wrote that "Randall probably took more pictures of celebrities before they became celebrities than just about anybody." His subjects included Brigitte Bardot, Pablo Picasso, Bernard Buffet, Jane Fonda, and Lauren Hutton. He photographed Ali MacGraw and Lynda Day George for "Seventeen" magazine.
His fashion and advertising work also appeared in "Glamour, Look, Good Housekeeping, Harper's Bazaar", and "Cosmopolitan".
In 1984, Prentice-Hall published his book "Fashion Photography: A Guide for the Beginner".
Death.
Randall died aged 65 in La Jolla's University Hospital on September 19, 1984, as a result of complications following heart bypass surgery. He had suffered a mild stroke some time earlier. He was survived by a brother, nephew, and cousin. He was interred at San Diego's Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery.

Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer

The Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer (also previously known as the Aero Electric Aircraft Corporation Sun Flyer) is an electric aircraft that was developed from the PC-Aero Elektra One by Bye Aerospace's Aero Electric Aircraft Corporation division of Denver, Colorado, United States, introduced in 2015. The company had a license agreement and engineering contract for the design with Calin Gologan, the Elektra One's designer.
Design and development.
The aircraft features composite construction, a cantilever low-wing, a single-seat, enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear with wheel pants and a single electric motor in tractor configuration.
The Sun Flyer differed from the PC-Aero Elektra One by incorporating new landing gear, propeller and instruments. It provided a prototype for a proposed two-seater that was to have four Panasonic lithium-ion batteries, along with solar panels installed on the wings, horizontal tail and on the fuselage behind the canopy. This two-seater was intended to be certified for day and night Visual Flight Rules. The proposed two-seat version of the Sun Flyer eventually led to a new design, the Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer 2 instead.
The Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology had reserved the first 20 two-seat models that were to be produced.

Fairy Tale about Father Frost, Ivan and Nastya

Fairy Tale about Father Frost, Ivan and Nastya (Czech: Pohádka o Mrazíkovi, Ivanovi a Nastěnce) is a 2000 Czech adventure game developed by Centauri Production and Bohemia Interactive. It was published by Bohemia Interactive.
Development.
The game is heavily inspired by the 1964 Soviet fairy-tale movie "Jack Frost" ("Морозко"). The authors of the game read over 1,000 original Russian and Czech fairy tales and legends to gain inspiration. 
The game was developed by Centauri Production with Bohemia Interactive providing motion-capture technology. The design style is hand-drawn animation, which were then modeled into the computer as 3D images. The game was meant to be released in October 2000, but this was postponed until mid-December with the final few weeks being spent finishing the voice overs. In cooperation with Bohemia Interactive, Bonusweb launched two competitions where entrants could win one of ten copies of the game. Due to the popularity of the game's soundtrack, four songs were released on Bonusweb in MP3 format.
"Fairy Tale about Father Frost, Ivan and Nastya" was included for free with the January 2009 issue of "Počítač pro každého".
Critical reception.
Games.cz felt the game would appeal to children because it was simple, clear, nice, and interesting. Just Adventure felt the title would appeal to players who looked for mild cartoon violence and minimal stress in their adventure games. Gry Online felt the developers had crafted an eye-catching, cartoonish visual setting. At the time Bonusweb deemed it the best Czech adventure game ever created, and the most technologically advanced adventure ever. Adventure Gamers disliked the repetitive fetch quests and one-note characters. Doupě said the game enjoyably extends the narrative of the film.

Theodora Sturkow-Ryder

Theodora Sturkow-Ryder (August 11, 1876 – August 3, 1958) was an American concert pianist, composer, music critic and piano teacher, based in Chicago.
Early life.
Theodora Sturkow was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in Chicago, the daughter of Ferdinand Louis Wilhelm Sturckow and Elizabeth Symington Sturckow. Her father was a baker and an amateur violinist who encouraged her musical interests. Her mother was a writer who used the pseudonym "Elizabeth Creighton". Her sister was actress Elsie Esmond. Frederick Grant Gleason and Regina Watson were among her teachers and mentors.
Career.
She was a soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1920, when one reviewer admired her as having "the strongest sort of rhythmic sense", adding that "her search for beautiful quality and fineness of interpretation is constant, and she never allows for one moment either harshness or uncertainty to creep into her playing."
She was a music critic for the "Pittsburgh Dispatch" newspaper, toured as a concert pianist, and taught at the American Academy of Music in Chicago. She was a member of the National Guild of Piano Teachers, the National League of American Pen Women, the Chicago Woman's Musical Club, and the San Francisco Musical Club. Her performing schedule was busy enough to involve flying between cities in 1922, still a novelty at the time. Later in her career, she represented a radio manufacturer, giving concerts and demonstrations and promoting radio as a tool for music education. From 1912 onwards, she was a pioneer in recording hand-played player piano rolls, and her playing is preserved on many hundreds of these rolls, recorded for the QRS, Ampico, and Aeolian companies.
Works composed by Sturkow-Ryder included "The Great Lakes" and "From the Family Album" (both symphonic suites), songs for piano and voice, and "twelve dances for violin and piano". She also co-wrote the music for a musical farce, "Stockyards Sally" (1922). She may have used the androgynous pseudonym "Dorian Welch" on some compositions and piano rolls. In 1935 she attended the American Women Composers' Conference in Chautauqua, New York.
Personal life.
Theodora Sturkow married twice. Her first husband was Benjamin Hudson Ryder, an electrical engineer from Pittsburgh; they married in 1906 and he died in 1925. Her second husband was Frank J. Snite. Theodora Sturkow-Ryder Snite died in 1958, aged 82 years, in Oakland, California. Sturkow-Ryder's papers are archived in the Newberry Library.

In My Blood (Shawn Mendes song)

"In My Blood" is a song recorded by Canadian singer Shawn Mendes. Written by Geoff Warburton, Scott Harris and its producers Mendes and Teddy Geiger, it was released by Island Records on March 22, 2018, as the lead single from Mendes' self-titled third studio album. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, and won Single of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2019. "In My Blood" also won Choice pop song at the Teen Choice Awards.
Background.
"In My Blood" chronicles Mendes' struggle with anxiety. It marks the first time the singer has publicly discussed his experiences with the mental health disorder.
Release and promotion.
On March 16, 2018, Mendes posted a collage on social media consisting of two uncaptioned images of blank color blocks, one in beige and one in coral. He later changed his profile picture to a beige background color with a floral design, as featured in the single's artwork.
On March 19, Mendes partnered with Spotify to promote the single on a billboard in New York's Times Square that reads "Shawn Mendes coming soon". Shortly after, he posted a video that includes two dates: March 22 and March 23. The dates were also projected in various places in London.
He officially announced the song on March 20, along with its release date and the single's artwork. "This song," he wrote in a social media post, "is the closest song to my heart that I've ever written". A Portuguese version was also released on June 3, 2018, in support of Portugal at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, owing to Mendes' Portuguese heritage.
Composition.
"In My Blood" is a rock and pop rock ballad, whose acoustic opening was described as "soft and despairing". As the song progresses, "an insistent drum comes in" before Mendes' voice rises on the chorus. A "Rolling Stone" contributor noted that the chorus features "shuddering drums" and "throbbing electric guitars", with "choral backing vocals" that "add soothing textures to the final hook". Mendes's vocals spare from A2 to C5 in this song.
Critical reception.
Jon Caramanica from "The New York Times" opined it as a standout in comparison to Mendes' previous singles, referring to how "scarred and forlorn" he sounds while commending his songwriting ability. Hugh McIntyre of Forbes.com noted that the song is an evolution of Mendes' well-known sound, beginning with "a familiar acoustic guitar". He wrote that Mendes has adopted "a more mature Kings of Leon-type sound", calling the song "a job well done".
Mike Nied of Idolator opined that "the sweeping anthem offers an intimate glimpse into his deepest thoughts", with a radio-friendly pop rock instrumental, adding that the song "sounds like another sure-fire smash". He concluded by calling it "a moving and inspiring track and a wonderful taste of things to come". Gil Kaufman of "Billboard" deemed the song "one of Mendes' most mature efforts to date". In another "Billboard" article, Abby Jones listed it as his best single to date. Fuse's Jeff Benjamin praised the song's mature themes and deemed it an "arena-rock anthem."
Chart performance.
It debuted at number 72 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 after only one day of sales and streaming tracking and four days of airplay tracking. It later rose to number 11. Mendes became the first artist to have four number-one songs on the Billboard Adult Top 40 radio airplay chart before turning 20 years old, with "In My Blood" being his fourth.
In Canada, the single debuted at 62 also after one day of tracking. The following week, it rose 53 spots to a new peak of 9, making it Mendes' fifth top 10 in his home country. It went number one in Hungary and reached the top 10 of several European and Asian countries.
In the United Kingdom, "In My Blood" debuted at Number 13 after one week of sales and fluctuated up and down the Top 20 before ultimately reaching its peak at 10 at the end of May. The song spent 13 weeks in the UK Top 40 and was Mendes' fifth top ten hit in the region.
Music video.
The music video for the song was uploaded on April 24, 2018. Directed by Jay Martin, the video features Shawn Mendes lying on the floor barefoot, while his surroundings begin to change. As he sings, it begins to snow and rain. The video ends with a wide shot of Mendes surrounded by a garden of flowers.
Live performances.
On March 28, 2018, Mendes made a live performance debut of the song on "The Late Late Show with James Corden". On April 12, Mendes performed the song live during the German Echo Music Prize. Mendes performed the song several times in the UK, including at the BBC Radio Live Lounge on April 19, on "Sounds Like Friday Night" on April 20, and at Queen Elizabeth II's 92nd birthday party at the Royal Albert Hall in London on April 21. On April 24, Mendes performed the song at the "TIME" 100 Gala.
Mendes's performance of the song on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" aired on May 17, and he performed the song at the 2018 "Billboard" Music Awards on May 20. He performed the song on "The One Show" on May 28, and as part of his set at BBC Music's Biggest Weekend in Swansea on May 27. Mendes also performed the song as part of his sets on "Today" and at the Governors Ball Music Festival, both on June 1 in New York City, and at Wango Tango the next day in Los Angeles. He performed the song at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards held in New York on August 20. In February 2019, he performed the song with Miley Cyrus at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. In May 2019, he performed the song on "Saturday Night Live".

Claire Wathes

(Dorothy) Claire Wathes née Bulman (born 1953) is a British veterinary researcher who studies the reproduction of farm animals. She is known for her work on infertility in dairy cattle. As of 2018, she is a professor of veterinary reproduction at the Royal Veterinary College in Hatfield.
Education and career.
Wathes gained a BSc in zoology from the University of Birmingham in 1974. Her PhD on fertility in dairy cattle was from the University of Nottingham in 1978, under the supervision of Eric Lamming; her thesis was entitled "Progesterone levels and fertility of lactating cows". In 1990, she was awarded a DSc by the University of Bristol.
Her first postdoctoral post was at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge. From 1979 to 1990, she worked in the University of Bristol's Department of Anatomy, holding positions successively as lecturer and reader, before rejoining the Babraham Institute as a project leader (1990–94). She has been professor of veterinary reproduction at the Royal Veterinary College since 1994, leading the college's Reproduction and Development Group from 1995 to 2007. She also holds a guest professorship at Huazhong Agricultural University in China (since 2009).
From 2000 to 2008, Wathes chaired "ARK-Genomics", the steering committee of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Investigating Gene Function Initiative for livestock, which aimed to facilitate genomics research across the UK. She became the first director of the Farm Animal Genetics and Genomics Faraday Partnership in 2002, and she continues to serve on a committee of its successor body, the Knowledge Transfer Network. She also served on the veterinary advisory committee of the Horserace Betting Levy Board (from 1997 until 2006 or 2008).
Research.
The long-term focus of Wathes' research has been reproduction in domestic ruminants, including cattle and sheep. Fertility in dairy cattle, and the problem of infertility, have formed an important part of her work from the outset. In her early research in Nottingham, with Lamming and others, she developed a method to diagnose and monitor low fertility in cows by measuring levels of the progesterone hormone in their milk. Her subsequent research at the Royal Veterinary College has investigated what causes cows to have low fertility, including their genetic background, nutrition and metabolic status, as well as bacterial infection of the uterus after calving. She has shown that lack of sufficient nutrients is an important cause of infertility.
While working at Bristol she showed, with Ray Swann, that the oxytocin hormone is produced in the corpus luteum of the ovary in sheep and other ruminants, as well as in the neurohypophysis. This might form part of the mechanism by which female ruminants detect whether or not they have conceived. She has subsequently studied how hormonal and other factors regulate the oestrus cycle and the birthing process in sheep and cows.
Awards and societies.
Wathes is an elected fellow of the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) and the Royal Society of Biology. She has served on the council of the Royal Society of Biology since 2017, and has also held roles on the committees of several other learned societies, including the European Society of Domestic Animal Reproduction, the Society for Endocrinology and the Society for Reproduction and Fertility.
Her awards include RASE's Research Medal (2006) for her work on fertility in dairy cattle, and the Society for Reproduction and Fertility's Marshall Medal (2015).
Personal life.
She was married to Christopher Wathes, also a veterinary researcher; he died in 2016.

Nigel Oakes

Nigel John Oakes (born July 1962) is a British businessman, and the founder and CEO of Behavioural Dynamics Institute and SCL Group (formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories), the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and her sister AggregateIQ ; the companies became known to a wider audience as a result of the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal involving the misuse of data. From the early 1990s Oakes' companies, operating under succession of names, were involved in influencing elections in developing countries, and with the onset of the War on Terror they were also contracted by the British military. Oakes first became known as the boyfriend of Lady Helen Windsor in the 1980s.
Early life.
Nigel Oakes was born in July 1962, the son of Major John Waddington Oakes, who was High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1996. His father bought Whichford House in Whichford, Warwickshire in the 1980s. His great-grandfather was the Reverend Beilby Porteus Oakes, a descendant of the bishop Beilby Porteus. The family belonged to the English landed gentry. He attended Eton College. He claimed on the now defunct SCL website to have studied psychology at University College London (UCL), but a university spokesman said they have no record of this, and Alexander Nix (a director of SCL) said Oakes attended UCL "in a private capacity."
Nigel Oakes' brother Alexander Waddington Oakes was also an executive with SCL Group/Cambridge Analytica.
Career.
Oakes ran a mobile disco, before working in advertising for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
In 1992, Oakes talked to a trade journal about his work: "We use the same techniques as Aristotle and Hitler ... We appeal to people on an emotional level to get them to agree on a functional level."
In 2000, his company Behavioural Dynamics was based in Jakarta, Indonesia, where he worked as an image consultant to President Abdurrahman Wahid, who was facing financial misconduct allegations.
In 2005, Oakes co-founded the London-based SCL Group (formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories), along with his younger brother Alexander Oakes and Alexander Nix, described as a polo playboy whose father Paul David Ashburner Nix also became an investor in the company.
In 2013, SCL established Cambridge Analytica, a subsidiary aiming to target the American elections market and led by fellow Old Etonian Alexander Nix, a director of SCL for 14 years. The company was engaged by the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns during the 2016 US presidential election, and reportedly also worked on dozens of other elections in the U.S. during its existence. The company went bankrupt in 2018 following the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Cambridge Analytica claimed to use honey traps, bribery stings, and prostitutes, among other tactics, to influence more than 200 elections globally for its clients.
Personal life.
Oakes was the second "serious boyfriend" of Lady Helen Windsor, and "appalled the Queen" after she smuggled him into her parents' grace-and-favour home, York House, St James's Palace.

Robert Cervero

Robert Cervero is an author, consultant, and educator in sustainable transportation policy and planning. During his years as a faculty member in city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley, he gained recognition for his work in the sphere of urban transportation and land-use planning. His research has spanned the topics of induced demand, transit-oriented development (TOD), transit villages, paratransit, car sharing, and suburban growth.
Academic and professional life.
Currently professor emeritus of City and Regional Planning, Cervero twice chaired Berkeley's urban planning department and also served as director of two research units: the University of California Transportation Center (UCTC, 2009-2017) and the Institute of Urban and Regional Development (IURD, 2009-2014). He held Berkeley planning department's first distinguished chair appointment, the Carmel P. Friesen Chair in Urban Studies from 2011 to 2016. Among his books are "Beyond Mobility" (2017), "Transforming Cities with Transit" (2013), "Informal Transport in the Developing World" (2001), "The Transit Metropolis" (1998), "Transit Villages in the 21st Century" (1997), "Paratransit in America (1997)", "America's Suburban Centers" (1989) and "Suburban Gridlock" (1986). His research earned him the first-ever Dale Prize for Excellence in Urban Planning Research and the Hsue-shen Tsien Gold Medal award for the translated version of "The Transit Metropolis". In 2013, UMB's Future Cities ranked him among the top 100 City Innovators Worldwide. Cervero twice received the Article of the Year Award from the "Journal of the American Planning Association ".
The work of Robert Cervero and others researching the link between transportation and urban form has not been without controversy. Most contentious has been the debate over whether built environments meaningfully influence travel behavior. Findings from a study led by Cervero on the influence of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system on the San Francisco Bay Area's urban development patterns were challenged on the grounds that BART provided few accessibility gains and built environments are largely unmalleable. Charging motorists more to reflect the environmental and congestion costs they imposed, it was countered, would significantly increase the land-use impacts of metro-rail investments like BART.
Cervero has been credited with "pioneering the use of the now-ubiquitous 'D' variables—density, diversity, and design—in explaining travel behavior." Research showing compact, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly developments — e.g., neo-traditional and transit-oriented communities 
— are associated with automobile travel has been tempered by studies showing this is partly explained by self-selection (i.e., the predisposition of some residents moving into walkable, transit-oriented neighborhoods to drive less for lifestyle reasons). Disagreement exists over the relative importance of self-selection vis-à-vis built environments in explaining travel behavior. Methodological challenges in linking compact development to driving has further muddied the waters.
Transit-oriented development is yet another domain where scholars disagree about its transportation impacts. A 2016 issue of "Planning" magazine referred to Robert Cervero as "the world's top expert on transit-oriented development". Research by him and others has linked TOD to reduced car ownership and usage, and correspondingly high ridership levels among those living and working near transit. Paul Mees, among others, has argued that the quality of transit services is more important in drawing people out of cars and into trains and buses than the location or density of development. Such debates aside, others point to other reasons for advancing TOD including increasing housing choices, physical activity, and social interaction.
While UC Berkeley was home for much of his academic life, Cervero has had visiting academic and research appointments at a number of other universities and institutions, including: University of Cambridge (Churchill College, Overseas Fellow); Nanyang Technological University (SMRT Visiting Professor); NYU-Abu Dhabi (Visiting Professor); University College London (Visiting Professor); University of Pennsylvania (Faculty Fellow); King Saud University (Academic Expert); Tongji University; University of Melbourne; Universidade Federal Do Rio de Janeiro; Institute of Technology Bandung; Korean Research Institute for Human Settlements; Harvard Institute for International Development; Dortmund University; and Urban Land Institute (Fellow). He has also chaired the International Association of Urban Environments, served on the Advisory Board of the World Economic Forum's Future of Urban Development and was a contributing author to the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) Fifth Assessment (2014) and UN-Habitat's Global Report on "Sustainable Urban Mobility" (2013).
Personal life.
Cervero is married to Sophia Cervero and they have three children: Kristen, Christopher, and Alexandria. A guitarist and mellotronist, Cervero has chronicled the music of the prog-rock band King Crimson as a collector of rare live recordings, anniversary parties, and listening parties of unreleased music (posted on Elephant Talk), and a tribute to mellotrons.
In the early 2000s, Cervero got involved with the Active Living movement, serving as chair of the National Advisory Committee of the Active Living Research (ALR) program for more than decade. This affiliation with active-living research prompted him to become more physically active himself. In his fifties to mid-sixties, he averaged a marathon or ultramarathon a month, run mostly on trails. Running and active living extended into his transportation research as well, including involvement in several National Academy projects and research on "Running to Work".

A Normal Lost Phone

A Normal Lost Phone is a 2017 puzzle video game developed by Accidental Queens and published by Playdius and Plug In Digital, released on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Nintendo Switch. The game was programmed by Diane Landais. In September 2017, a spiritual sequel to the game was released, entitled Another Lost Phone: Laura's Story. The games explore themes of LGBT identity and domestic abuse by asking the player to investigate the phone of a stranger.
Development.
Originally developed during a game jam, the team would retrospectively identify design mistakes that were rectified in the sequel.
Gameplay.
Both games are played entirely as a simulation of a cell phone. In each game, the player is tasked with voyeuristically searching through a lost cell phone, in order to discover what happened to its owner. Each game features puzzles where the player will have to use clues inferred from one part of the phone to unlock another, such as figuring out a character's birth year which is used as a password for one app by inferring this information from another part of the app.
Plot.
"A Normal Lost Phone".
The player investigates the phone of a person named Sam living in the fictional city of Melren, thereby discovering bits about their life.
As the game progresses the player discovers several major secrets and events, such as the attempted rape of a friend by another of Sam's acquaintances. The player also learns that Sam is a bisexual transgender woman named Samira and has been hiding this from multiple people in her life, to whom she presented as a straight male. The player will eventually discover Sam's dating profiles, one where she presents as male and another as female, and a forum for transgender persons, where Sam comes to terms with her true gender. She eventually decides to come out to an acquaintance of hers named Lola, only to be met with hostility, which greatly depresses her. To make matters worse, she discovers that her parents and girlfriend Melissa are very bigoted towards the LGBT community, leading to Sam breaking up with Melissa.
Sam eventually gains enough courage to come out to her friend Alice, who accepts her warmly. She's heartbroken when she realizes that Alice will be leaving town to attend college in another area, which will rob her of what Sam sees as the only positive person in her life, especially as she learns that her family has a history of disowning gay relatives. Ultimately, Sam chooses to leave home to reinvent herself in another town after her father gifts her a motorbike for her 18th birthday and throws away her phone, aware that someone may find it and sift through her information. The only person she tells is Alice, who congratulates Sam on taking charge of her own life and comforts her by saying that anyone who finds her phone will likely erase the phone's data, especially if they have read all of the information and realized that this is what Sam would want. The game ends when the player erases the phone's data per Alice's message.
"Another Lost Phone: Laura's Story".
This game tasks the player with investigating the discarded cell phone of a woman named Laura. A preliminary investigation of the phone presents Laura's life as idyllic; she is head-over-heels in love with her boyfriend, Ben.
The player eventually learns that Laura has suffered a stressful ordeal at work; an unknown person created a fake email account in her name, and forwarded a private, erotic video of her to all of her work contacts, which not only compromised her employment but also her company's relationship with other organizations. The event opened up Laura to sexual harassment and culminated in her having to work from home. Laura initially suspected her ex-boyfriend Alex, the one she originally sent the video to years ago, to have sent the video out as an act of jealousy; but Alex convinces her of his innocence. Laura is contacted by a woman named Claire (who initially uses the pseudonym of Amanda), who warns Laura that Ben is manipulative and was responsible for this event; however, as Ben had previously warned Laura of Claire (saying that she was jealous of him in the past and tried to sabotage his past relationships), Laura doesn't believe her. Laura also begins experiencing symptoms that suggest she is pregnant, and she feels she isn't ready to have a child with him.
It eventually becomes clear that Laura is actually in an abusive relationship with Ben; at the suggestion of her colleague and friend Charlotte, Laura attends a domestic violence seminar and learns about the cycle of abuse, and notes the similarities between the cycle and her relationship with Ben. Slowly, Charlotte is able to wake Laura up to the realization that Ben is manipulating her. Claire, now believed by Laura, reveals that Ben was once physically violent to a previous girlfriend of his, and wanting to avoid a repeat situation is what drove Claire to contact Laura. Laura is able to secure a different job for her company in a different city, so she discards her phone, and requests to the phone's founder (the player) that they enable the GPS service to lead Ben down a false trail (to stop him from harassing Laura's friends and family about her disappearance), and then erase the phone's data. The game ends when the player does so, and the ending reveals that Laura was never pregnant and is enjoying her new life away from her abusive ex-partner.
Reception and accolades.
On Metacritic, the game has a score of 83/100 on iOS, 71/100 on PC, and 73/100 on Switch.
It was nominated for "Best Mobile Game" and "Best Screenplay", and won the "Special Jury Prize" with "Another Lost Phone: Laura's Story" at the 2017 Ping Awards; it was also nominated for the A-Train Award for Best Mobile Game at the New York Game Awards 2018; and for "Best Emotional Mobile and Handheld Game" and "Best Emotional Indie Game" at the Emotional Games Awards 2018.

David N. Redden was born in 1949 in the Canton, China (now named Guangzhou), where his father served as an American Consul for the US State Department. Nine months later he and his parents were withdrawn by the State Department as the Red Army advanced on Canton and transferred to Haifa, Israel. His father eventually became American Consul General in London and Rome, where Redden spent much of his youth and education, receiving his high school diploma from St. Stephen's School in Rome. He later graduated from the Art History program at Wesleyan University, where he actively participated in anti-Vietnam War demonstrations.
Auction career.
Redden began his auction career as a catalog trainee at Sotheby's in 1974. He initially joined with the company in order to learn more about his passion, collecting. By 1975 he was an auctioneer. Between his start at Sotheby's and the mid-1990s, Redden created numerous new auction categories for the company, including the specialty categories such as “space-memorabilia”, “baseball memorabilia, comic books, arcade machines, and computerized animation art.” Early in his career, in the late 1970s, he was appointed the director of PB-84, Sotheby's satellite auction house that focused on lower-priced items and unusual collecting categories. He later also became credited with developing the Internet strategy for Sotheby's in the late 1990s when he became chairman of Sothebys.com. Redden is best known as the manager and auctioneer for many of Sotheby's most celebrated live auctions. Redden served as a Vice-Chairman of Sotheby's from February 2000 to 2016, when he retired. He was also the Worldwide Chairman of Sotheby's Books and Manuscripts.
As an auctioneer Redden's sales included two first printings of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the Collections of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the Empress Josephine's copy of Redoute's "Les Liliacees" containing the original watercolors, the Estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; a series of popular auctions for the Walt Disney Company; the largest, most complete, and best preserved Tyrannosaurus rex fossil ever recovered known as “Sue”; the most valuable coin ever sold, the 1933 Double Eagle; the "Bay Psalm Book", the first book printed in America; the world's most valuable stamp, the British Guiana 1¢ Magenta; Albert Einstein's manuscript on "Special Relativity", a moon lander (still on the moon), three returned space capsules, and the first sale of luna rocks brought back from the Moon; the manuscript of the "Magna Carta" now in the National Archives; two of the greatest book sales of the 20th century, the library of H. Bradley Martin and the Garden Ltd. Collection; the Nelson Bunker Hunt sale of Ancient Coins, the Four Battleflags of the Revolution, the George Catlin Native American portraits collected in the 19th century by Benjamin O'Fallon, and the Bomberg "Talmud" from the Valmadonna Library. Several books have been written about his sales including "Tyrannosaurus Sue" by Steve Fiffer, "Illegal Tender" by David Tripp, and "The One-Cent Magenta" by James Barron.
Other notable auctions include: The Barry Halper Collection of Baseball Memorabilia, The Washington-Lafayette Cincinnati Medal, James Naismith's manuscript for The Rules of Basketball, The Guidon (flag) from the Battle of Little Bighorn, Robert Kennedy's copy of The Emancipation Proclamation signed by Lincoln, and Treasure from the SS Central America.
Privately, Redden sold Gilbert Stuart's Lansdowne Portrait of George Washington to the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, the papers of Martin Luther King Jr. to the city of Atlanta and the nine Forbes family Fabergé Imperial Easter Eggs. He was also involved in the discovery of the missing first half on the manuscript for "Huckleberry Finn". Upon his retirement, Redden was the longest-serving auctioneer in Sotheby's history.
Collusion Scandal.
In the 1990s Sotheby's and Christie's colluded on auction commissions and other business practices. Redden, who had no prior knowledge of the crime, was the first staff member at either Christie's or Sotheby's to speak out publicly decrying the criminal activities of the leadership of the two firms.
Acting.
Redden performed in the following films:
Boards and Philanthropy.
Redden has served as chairman of the following boards: Scenic Hudson, Black Rock Forest, which has created the David Redden Conservation Science Fund which awards grants to scientists of all ages and supports lectures and seminars; The Olana Partnership, the Hudson Highlands Nature Museum, the American Trust for the British Library, and St. Stephen's School in Rome, Italy. He also served on the boards of the Hudson Highlands Land Trust, the Chelsea Square Conservancy, Friends of Hudson River Park, Madison Square Boys &amp; Girls Club, and the Theater Institute at Storm King. While serving as Chairman of Scenic Hudson, he led $50 million in preservation efforts and land acquisitions. He and his wife have donated conservation easements over a portion of their Storm King Mountain property to the Hudson Highlands Land Trust. For many years he was a sought-after auctioneer for charity benefits.
ALS.
In 2017 Redden was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The physical decline associated with ALS has prevented Redden from completing the editing of his very extensive "Private Diary of a Sotheby’s Auctioneer".  In 2019 his family created the David Redden ALS Fund to benefit ALS research and treatment at Columbia University.
Personal life.
In 1978 Redden married Jeannette, currently a Commissioner of the Palisades Interstate Park. They have two children, Stephen and Clare.

Agglomerated food powder

Agglomerated food powder is a unit operation during which native particles are assembled to form bigger agglomerates, in which the original particle can still be distinguished. Agglomeration can be achieved through processes that use liquid as a binder (wet methods) or methods that do not involve any binder (dry methods).
Description.
The liquid used in wet methods can be added directly to the product or via a humid environment. Using a fluidized bed dryer and multiple step spray drying are two examples of wet methods while roller compacting and extrusion are two examples of dry methods.
Advantages of agglomeration for food include:
Disadvantages of food agglomeration:
Particle size distribution is an important parameter to monitor in agglomerated food products. In both wet and dry agglomeration, particles of undesired sizes must be removed to ensure the best possible finished product performance. High-powered cyclones are the most common way to separate undesired fine particles (or "fines") from larger agglomerates (or "overs"). Cyclones utilize the combination of wind power and the different densities of the two products to pull the fines out of the mix. The fines can then be reworked through the agglomeration process to reduce yield loss. In contrast, shaker screens are often used to separate out the overs from the rest of the product. The overs can be reworked into the process by first being broken into smaller particles.
Wet agglomeration methods.
Wet agglomeration is a process that introduces a liquid binder to develop adhesion forces between the dry particles to be agglomerated. Mixing disperses the liquid over the particles evenly and promotes growth of the aggregate to the desired size. A final drying step is required to stabilize the agglomerates.
In all wet agglomeration methods, the first step is wetting the particles. This initiates adhesion forces between the particles. The next step, nucleation, is the process by which the native particles come together and are held with liquid bridges and capillary forces. Then, through coalescence or the growth phase, these small groups of particles come together to create larger particles until the particles are the desired size. Consolidation occurs as the agglomerates increase in density and strength through drying and collisions with other particles. Mixing as the powder dries also causes some particles to break and erode, creating smaller particles and fines. To achieve the correct particle size, erosion and growth must be balanced. The last step in wet agglomeration is the final stabilization through drying. The agglomerated particles are dried to less than 5% water content, and cooled to below their glass transition temperature.
Wet agglomeration falls into two categories based on method of agitation: Mechanical mixing and pneumatic mixing.
Dry agglomeration methods.
Dry agglomeration is agglomeration performed without water or binding liquids, instead using compression only.
Roller compaction.
Roller compaction is a process in which powders are forced between two rolls, which compress the powders into dense sticks or sheets. These sticks or sheets are then ground into granules. Material properties will affect the mechanical properties of the resulting granules. Food particles with crystalline structures will deform plastically under pressure, and amorphous materials will deform viscoelastically. Roller compaction is more commonly used on individual ingredients of a finished powdered food product, than on a blend of ingredients producing a granulated finished product.
Some advantages of roller compaction are 
Disadvantages: 
Examples of agglomerated food powders: Sucrose, sodium chloride, monosodium glutamate and fibers.
Extrusion.
Extrusion is executed by mixing the powder with liquid, additives, or dispersants and then compressing the mixture and forcing it through a die. The product is then dried and broken down to the desired particle size. Extruded powders are dense. Extrusion is typically used for ingredients such as minerals and highly-hygroscopic products which benefit from reduced surface area, as well as products that are subject to oxidation. Extrusion for agglomeration should not be confused with the more common food extrusion process that involves creating a dough that is cooked and expands as it passes through the die.

Photocrime

Photocrime is an American television crime drama that was broadcast on ABC from September 28, 1949, until December 14, 1949. The program was also known as Look Photocrime.
The program's title and premise -- "that photographs often possess clues that are often overlooked" initially -- came from an illustrated fictional crime series that ran in "Look" magazine, and the program was produced in association with "Look". However, the concept of an illustrated mystery began with Denis Horton, an insurance clerk in England. The "Weekly Illustrated" published the first Photocrime in 1935. By 1937, Photocrime was also printed in a number of American newspapers. 
Chuck Webster portrayed police inspector Hannibal Cobb. Murray Burnett was the producer and writer. Babette Henry was the director.
Lack of a sponsor brought the program to an end after 13 weeks.
Critical reaction.
In a review in the trade publication "Billboard", Leon Morse wrote that the program's premiere episode "represented a measure of noticeable but not spectacular progress in bringing mysteries to the video screen."
The "Television Daily" section of the trade publication "Radio Daily" welcomed the program's main character as "a near-anomaly, a quiet police detective with enough ability and intelligence to get his man."
Other versions.
An unsuccessful pilot episode of a program dramatizing material from the Photocrimes in "Look" was broadcast on CBS on October 2, 1945.
In 1958, Teleworld, Inc., announced plans to produce a series of 5-minute television programs titled "Photocrimes" and based on the magazine feature of the same name. Plans called for 260 episodes to be produced.

The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York

The Bank for Savings in the City of New York (1819–1982) was the first savings bank in New York City until it was merged with the Buffalo Savings Bank in 1982. It was one of the earliest-opened banks in the United States, becoming an official bank in 1819.
History.
The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York was the fourth bank to be opened in the United States and the first savings bank in Manhattan. It was founded in 1816, although it was not incorporated by the NY State Legislature until March 16, 1819. First publicly advertised as "A BANK FOR THE POOR", it was modeled after similar institutions in Europe; its stated purpose was to "effect a secure place of deposit for the earnings of the laboring part of the community: and at the same time to give them the benefit of an accumulation of interest". " One of the bank's founders, Thomas Eddy, further explained the charitable impetus behind the entity's formation, "Among the many philanthropic institutions with which your country abounds, there is none that appears to me more likely to be useful than Savings Banks. They are certainly most admirably calculated to be beneficial to the poor, by promoting among them a spirit of independence, economy and industry."
The bank's first location was at Chambers Street. The site became equally famous for being the venue where the first Egyptian mummy was displayed in the United States in 1824. The bank then moved to Bleecker Street (April 10, 1856), at which time it became familiarly called the Bleecker Street Savings Bank. 
During the Civil War, the bank was reputed to be a bellwether of the nation's prosperity with the bank holding over eleven million dollars but also boasting the largest number of depositors from the working class in New York State. Following a fire that badly damaged the building, the bank moved from Bleecker to 280 Fourth Avenue at Twenty-second Street on August 15, 1894. A large white marble Romanesque structure was designed by Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz. Later headquarters were located on Park Avenue South.
Notable Directors.
Among its founders and first directors were Thomas Eddy, William Bayard Jr., DeWitt Clinton, Archibald Gracie, Cadwallader D. Colden, John Pintard, Matthew Clarkson, Peter Augustus Jay and Brockholst Livingston. Although many credit Eddy with founding the institution, Bayard served as the bank's first president. Other famous directors included Frederic James de Peyster, a prominent soldier and philanthropist as well as politician Hamilton Fish who stepped down from the board when he became US Secretary of State. 
Demise.
It later merged with the Buffalo Savings Bank in 1982 and its name was subsequently changed to Goldome.
It failed in 1991 along with a number of other banks. The bank is no longer in existence today.

Alleged Libyan financing in the 2007 French presidential election

Alleged Libyan financing in the 2007 French presidential election purportedly took the form of Libya's covert and illicit bankrolling of the presidential campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy with up to €50 million in pay-outs. Sarkozy has denied wrongdoing and rejected suggestions he was a Libyan agent of influence during his tenure as president of France. He has since officially been charged for corruption on March 21, 2018.
Background.
2007 election.
In May 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy was elected President of France in a six-point victory over Ségolène Royal. Sarkozy officially spent €21 million on his campaign. The size of the campaign spend, relative to those seen in United States elections, prompted French scholar Sophie Meunier to later declare that "French politicians are, therefore, not enslaved to special interests or Super-PACs as they are in the U.S."
During the 2007 French election, candidates were limited to spending no more than €21 million, and no single person could donate in excess of €7500 to a candidate. In addition, the sources of donations had to be publicly declared and contributions from foreign nationals were prohibited.
Libyan détente and later reversal.
In December 2007, following Sarkozy's inauguration as President of France, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi visited the country on Sarkozy's invitation but over the objections of both the political opposition and members of Sarkozy's own government. The visit marked the first time Gaddafi had been to France in more than 35 years and, during the visit, France agreed to sell Libya 21 Airbus aircraft and signed a nuclear cooperation agreement. Negotiations for the purchase of more than a dozen Dassault Rafale fighter jets, plus military helicopters, were also initiated during the trip.
In 2011, France, under Sarkozy, voted for international military intervention in the Libyan Civil War against the Gaddafi government in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 and, subsequently, attacked Libyan government forces in Opération Harmattan, in support of the National Transitional Council. France stated the move was to protect Libyan civilians.
Allegations.
The same month French forces were committed to the Libyan conflict, Saif-al-Islam Gaddafi, a son of Muammar Gaddafi, gave an interview to Euronews in which he first publicly claimed that the Libyan state had donated €50 million to Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for access and favours by Sarkozy.
Sarkozy rejected the claim by Gaddafi.
The following October, the claim of Libyan funding of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign was repeated by former Libyan prime minister Baghdadi Mahmudi. Investigative website Mediapart subsequently published several documents appearing to prove a payment of €50 million, and also published a claim by Ziad Takieddine that he had personally handed three briefcases stuffed with cash to Sarkozy. French magistrates later acquired diaries of former Libyan oil minister Shukri Ghanem in which payments to Sarkozy were mentioned. Shortly thereafter, however, Ghanem was found dead, floating in the Danube in Austria and thereby preventing his corroboration of the diaries.
In 2014, television station France 3 released an audio recording made by Delphine Minoui on March 16, 2011, during which Minoui interviewed Muammar Gaddafi. In the recording, Gaddafi tells Minoui that Sarkozy had approached him seeking funds for his presidential election campaign while still serving as French interior minister.
In February 2018 "Asharq Al-Awsat" quoted a source who alleged Sarkozy had promised Libyan representatives improved relations between France and Libya should he be elected president, and that he would wrap-up the matter of the bombing of UTA Flight 772. As recently as 2018, Saif al-Islam reiterated his 2011 claim, and has since also added that a former officer of the Libyan intelligence service was at that time in possession of a recording of a meeting between Muammar Gaddafi and Sarkozy that occurred in Tripoli in 2007 and at which payments were discussed.
Investigation.
In 2013 the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (DCPJ) officially opened an investigation into the allegations of Libyan funding of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign. In March 2018, Sarkozy-era interior minister Brice Hortefeux voluntarily appeared before French police for questioning. Several arrests have been made in relation to the inquiry.
Reaction.
Sarkozy's political party, The Republicans, issued a statement following his arrest in which it said the former president had the party's full support. Spokesman Christian Jacob later suggested that the accusations against Sarkozy were politically motivated.
Following Sarkozy's arrest, Eric Ciotti expressed confidence the former president would be exonerated.

Irlam (1825 ship)

Irlam was launched in 1825 at Liverpool for Barton &amp; Co., which had lost two earlier vessels named "Irlam": in 1812, and in 1824. The current "Irlam" was smaller than her predecessors, but was employed in the same trade, Liverpool–Barbados. 
"Irlam" entered "Lloyd's Register" in 1826 with D. Campbell, master, Barton &amp; Co., owner, and trade Liverpool–Barbados. Her listing in the "Register of Shipping" in 1826 has the same information.
In 1831 her master was J. Taylor.
"Irlam" was wrecked on 11 August 1831 in the Great Barbados Hurricane of 1831. Sixteen vessels, barks, brigs, brigantines, and schooners were driven ashore. "Irlam" was one of the two barks driven onshore. All the vessels, with the exception of two mail boats and a schooner, were totally lost.

Whichford House

Whichford House is a grade II* listed house in the village of Whichford, Warwickshire, England.
Whichford House was built in the 17th century as St Michael's Rectory, and in the 18th century it was enhanced with an open stairwell, a stone chimneypiece, and wood panelling in the principal rooms.
In the 1950s, it ceased to be used as the Rectory, and the Church of England sold it to the publisher George Rainbird, for £1,400.

Mariam Behnam

Mariam Behnam (, 25 February 1921 - 4 December 2014) was an Iranian-born Emirati writer, diplomat and women's rights activist. After graduating from high school and beginning her career as a teacher in Pakistan, she returned to Iran and began to work on social improvement projects first in Teheran and later in Bandar Abbas. In the 1960s, she returned to Pakistan and served for eight years as a cultural attaché establishing cultural centers, libraries and promoting Iranian culture. She was honored with the Iranian Order of the Crown and a Pakistani badge of courage for remaining in the country and continuing her work during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, when other diplomats fled the country. Returning to Iran in 1972, she worked with the Ministry of Arts and Culture in the Sistan and Baluchestan Province and later the Hormozgan Province developing programs to preserve and promote the cultural heritage of the areas.
In 1978, Behnam fled Iran during the revolution and settled in Dubai. She worked as a newspaper writer and then co-founded the cultural magazine "Al Juma" to promote the arts. She joined women's organizations and advocated for improved rights for women and helped instigate training programs to preserve traditional crafts. Beginning in the 1990s, she published several novels and an autobiography, as well as poetry. In 2010, Behnam was honored as the Emirates Woman of the Year.
Early life.
Mariam Behnam was born on 25 February 1921 in Bandar Lengeh in the Hormozgan Province of Iran to Hafsa Abbas and Abdul Wahid Behnam. Her wealthy family was involved in the pearl trade and owned homes in "Bombay, Bahrain, Dubai, Karachi and Paris". Born in the same year that an earthquake hit her hometown and because she had a forceful personality, Behnam was given the nickname "Zelzelah Bibi" (Little Earthquake). Her mother died when she was ten years old and Wahid was raised, along with her five surviving siblings, by her maternal grandmother, Monkhali (née Kingely) Abbas. Against her family's wishes, who saw no reason for girls to be educated, she pressed to go to public school and was finally granted permission to attend the Jufel Hurst High School in Karachi.
At the age of eighteen, Behnam married her Saudi Arabian cousin, Zakaria Siddique Bundakji and moved to Bombay. The marriage was short-lived, when her husband abandoned her and moved to South Africa and remarried. Behnam returned to Karachi, where in 1944, she gave birth to their son, Essa. After she filed for an annulment which took seven years to obtain, she returned to school in Bombay and then matriculated in Lahore in 1946, becoming the first woman in her family to graduate from a public school.
Career.
Over family objections, Behnam determined to become a teacher, took a post at her alma mater, Jufel Hurst High School. In 1947, Behnam took her grandmother on a lengthy trip traveling to Dubai and Bahrain, where they received an invitation to reconnect with their father, who they had not seen for many years. Behnam traveled to Iran and stayed three months and upon her return to Karachi, was invited by her father to relocate to Teheran. Moving with her son, she first worked on implementation of the Point Four Plan to improve health and education throughout the country. In the early 1950s, she allowed her son to go and live with his father, and soon thereafter, Behnam married a widower, Abdulla Pakravan, who had two children from a previous marriage, gave up her career, and moved to Bandar Abbas.
Her retirement was short-lived, and after a year of living in Bandar Abbas, in 1956, Behnam became involved in a project to establish a high school for girls and joined the Ministry of Education. That same year, she gave birth to a daughter, Shahnaz, who was followed within a year by a second daughter, Shirin. Behnam's improvement projects in Bandar Abbas included establishing courses at the high school for health and offering pre-natal and ante-natal courses on childcare. Joining several social and cultural organizations, she spearheaded project to establish an arts and crafts center, the first cinema, a public garden, a public library and founded the Museum of Anthropology.
In 1963, Behnam transferred from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Arts and Culture and 1964 she returned to Pakistan with an appointment to teach Persian in Lahore at the Iranian Cultural Center. Returning to school while simultaneously working, she completed bachelor's degree in 1967 and then earned a master's degree in literature from the University of Punjab in Lahore. Upon receipt of her bachelor's, Behnam was promoted to director of the Cultural Center, becoming the first Iranian woman appointed as a cultural attaché. During this time frame, there was considerable unrest in Pakistan as well as two wars: the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and Pakistani Civil War in 1971. Benham chose to remain at her post, though most foreigners were evacuated in the period. In 1965, she was awarded the Nishane Taj Medal for her bravery by the Shah and in 2010 was awarded a badge of courage from Pakistan.
In 1972, after eight years in Lahore, during which she established several cultural centers and libraries, Behnam returned to Iran, moving to Teheran. She was first placed in a department developing audio-visual educational technology, but within three years, was made director general of Arts and Culture for the Sistan and Baluchestan Province. She established a training school in Zahedan to preserve the art work of the area and improve the perception of artisans and their crafts. In 1977, after two years in Zahedan, Behnam moved back to Bandar Abbas, and was asked to run for a Parliamentary seat by the Ministry. Having little political aspiration, she did not campaign and lost her race, instead accepting the directorship of Arts and Culture for the Hormozgan Province.
When the Iranian Revolution intensified in 1978, Behnam fled the country moving to Dubai. Within a week of her arrival in the United Arab Emirates, she began working as a journalist at the newly launched "Gulf News". For three years, she worked as a features writer for the English-language newspaper. In the 1980s, she joined the Gulf News Ladies Society and worked as a promoter organizing exhibits for traditional women's handicrafts. At the time, little was known about the Emirati art scene and she helped found and publish the magazine, "Al Juma". She began publishing poems in English, Persian, and Urdu and subsequently published four books, the first of which was her autobiography, "Zelzelah: A woman before her time". When the Gulf News Ladies Society went defunct, Behnam joined the Dubai International Women's Club advocating for women's rights and working as a motivational speaker. She was honored as the Emirates Woman of the Year in 2010.
Death and legacy.
Behnam died on 4 December 2014 in Dubai, and was buried at the Al Qouz Cemetery At the time of her death, she was working on a fifth book of fiction.

Xenia Rubinos

Xenia Rubinos (born July 24, 1985) is an American singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. 
Background and early life.
Xenia Rubinos was born in Hartford, CT in 1985 to a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban father. She studied jazz composition at the Berklee College of Music. She spent most of her 20s acting as the primary caregiver for her father as he dealt with a degenerative illness, which inspired her song "Black Stars." She has lived in Brooklyn since 2006.
Career.
Her album "Black Terry Cat" was released to critical acclaim and was named the 11th best album of 2016 by NPR.
Music.
Rubinos' early music influences include composers like Prokofiev and Ravel, as her father was a fan of classical music and opera. Salsa, rumba and merengue, including releases by Fania Records, were popular in her house while growing up. Later, she became enthralled with hip-hop, R&amp;B and Miles Davis in particular, which led her to study jazz at the Berklee College of Music.
She is inspired by her Latin American heritage and Santería practices. She is also inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, and discusses her experiences as a woman of color in her songs, but she sees her music as broader than the category of protest music.
Rubinos' music is not easily categorized, as she crosses many genres in both her lyrics and her sound.

Bouzanquet Bay

The Bouzanquet Bay is a vast freshwater body of the south-eastern part of the Gouin Reservoir, in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in Haute-Mauricie, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in the province of
Quebec, in Canada.
This bay extends into the cantons of Nevers (northern part), Delage (southern part) and Leblanc (eastern part). Following the erection completed in 1948 of the dam Gouin, the current form of "Baie Bouzanquet" was shaped by the raising of the waters of Gouin reservoir.
Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second.
The route 400, connecting the Gouin Dam to the village of Parent, Quebec, serves the southern part of Bouzanquet Bay, as well as the river valleys Jean-Pierre and Leblanc; this road also serves the peninsula which stretches north in the Gouin reservoir on . Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
The surface of Baie Bouzanquet is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to the end of March.
Toponymy.
This toponym evokes the work of life of Gaston Bouzanquet, officer of the Legion of Honor and corresponding member of the Society of Geography of Quebec. Bouzanquet published in the Bulletin of the latter (volume 22, numbers 1 and 2, 1928), a text dedicated to the history of New France and to Monsieur de Montcalm in particular. Bouzanquet served as delegate of the committee of Vauvert at the inauguration of the monument of Montcalm, in 1911, in Quebec City.
The toponym "Baie Bouzanquet" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Quebec, i.e. at its creation.

The practice was marred by a three-car crash on the back-straightaway that resulted in McMurray barrel rolling several times into the inside catchfence while Ty Dillon and Ryan Newman were also involved. “When I realized I was going to flip, I actually shut my eyes because I don't really want to see what's getting ready to happen,” McMurray said. “And then it just kept, it seemed like forever. I opened my eyes a couple times and I couldn't, I'm like I don't know if I'm going up or down or where it's going to hit next. So I was just thankful when it finally ... a couple of times I thought it was going to stop and it just kind of kept going.” McMurray's accident led to NASCAR reducing the restrictor plates from 7/8th to 55/64th of an inch.

José da Silva Lisboa

José da Silva Lisboa, first Baron and Viscount of Cairu (July 16, 1756 in Salvador – August 20, 1835 in Rio de Janeiro), was an economist, historian, jurist, publicist and Brazilian politician, active at the time of Independence of the Brazil and credited for the promotion of important economic reforms. He held various positions in the economic and political administration of Brazil after the transfer or the Portuguese Court to Brazil in 1808, including Deputy of the Royal Chamber of Commerce ("") and Judge of the House of Supplication (" - a" court of appeal).
Cairu played an important role in encouraging the teaching of political economy in the country, and participated actively in the drafting of the decrees that determined the (ending the Exclusive Metropolitan Trade, by which Brazil could only trade with Portugal) and the end of the prohibition of manufactures in Brazil. His attitude favorable to the economic development of the would end up contributing significantly to the conditions indispensable to the political independence of Brazil in 1822. For his contributions, the Viscount of Cairu figures "with place of honor in the pantheon of the heroes of the Brazilian homeland".
Studies.
Son of a Portuguese architect, Henrique da Silva Lisboa, and Helena Nunes de Jesus, José studied in Bahia from the age of eight, especially philosophy, music and piano. He completed his studies at the University of Coimbra, where he followed legal and philosophical courses from 1774, graduating in 1778. Bachelor in canons by the University of Coimbra, he was appointed professor of national and moral philosophy for the city of Salvador, Bahia, chair which he held for 19 years, besides having created the chair of Greek language in the city.
Public creer.
In 1797 he returned to Portugal, obtaining his retirement and the appointment to the place of deputy and secretary of the Inspection Bureau of sugar and Bahia Tobacco ("Mesa da Inspeção da Bahia"), where he took office in 1798 and stayed until 1808.
In 1801 he published his first book "Principles of Mercantile Law and Laws of the Navy for the use of the Portuguese youth, which includes maritime insurance, maritime exchange, damages, bills of exchange, merchant contracts, courts and causes of trade" (or "Princípios do Direito Mercantil e Leis da Marinha para uso da mocidade portuguesa, que compreende o seguro marítimo, o câmbio marítimo, as avarias, as letras de câmbio, os contratos mercantes, os tribunais e as causas de comércio")"." In 1804 he published his main work, the Principles of Political Economy ("Princípios de economia política"), the first Portuguese-written book inspired in Adam Smith's work
When Dom Joao VI arrived in Bahia in 1808, Cairu drew up a representation of merchants from Salvador, in which they requested the opening of the Brazilian ports to the friendly nations of Portugal, which resulted in the Royal Charter of January 24, 1808. D. João ordered Silva Lisboa to accompany him to Rio de Janeiro, where he arrived on March 7, and in the following April he was appointed judge of the Supreme Court (").
In August 1808 he was appointed deputy of the Royal Chamber of Commerce, Agriculture, Factories and Navigation of the State of Brazil; in 1809 he was charged with organizing a code of commerce; and in 1815 he was in charge of the examination of the works for printing.
Silva Lisboa tried to reconcile Portugal and Brazil and prevent the separation between them, and for this he founded a newspaper, The Conciliador of the United Kingdom ("), in which he defended the rights of the Prince and pondered the advantages of the continental monarchy. When the hope for conciliation disappeared, and in order not to lose the support of the crown, Lisboa did not hesitate to fight for the independence movement led by the prince regent D. Pedro I.
Defender of the centralization of the power, Silva Lisboa fought in the press the revolutionaries of the Confederation of the Equator and polemizou with the of Frei Caneca. After independence, he continued to hold high positions, receiving honorary distinctions. He was awarded in 1825 with the title of Baron and later in 1826 as Viscount of Cairu, and was later chosen as senator of the Brazilian Empire. Also in 1825, Silva Lisboa was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.
In 1832, he began to fight for the creation of a University in Rio de Janeiro, a fact only concretized almost a hundred years later, with the foundation of UFRJ.

Tatyana Sumarokova

Tatyana Nikolaevna Sumarokova (; 16 September 1922 28 May 1997) was a Soviet navigator and Guard Lieutenant in the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment during the Second World War. Rejected for the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1945 after completing 725 sorties, she was eventually awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation in 1995.
Early life.
Sumarokova was born on 16 September 1922 to a Russian family. After graduating from secondary school in 1939 she entered the 1st Moscow State Medical Institute where she studied until the start of the war. Initially she remained a civilian and worked in the construction of defensive fortifications around Moscow. She eventually got word that women were being recruited for aviation units, and non-pilot staff were needed, so she and her friend Khiuaz Dospanova made an appointment to meet with Marina Raskova, who at their meeting asked if she was willing to become a navigator.
Military career.
Upon being accepted into the women's aviation program in October 1941, Sumarokova underwent navigator's training at the Engels Military Aviation School with the rest of the women accepted into the program. After completing navigation training in February 1942 she underwent further flight training to compensate for her previous lack of aviation experience, graduating from training in time for deployment to the front on 23 May 1942 as part of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment; the women's aviation unit arrived on the North Caucasian Front on 27 May. She received her first Order of the Red Banner in September that same year after making several combat sorties in heavy autumn fog. By October 1942 she had completed 146 sorties.
Throughout the war Sumarokova took part in offensives over Kuban, Crimea, the Caucasus, Taman, Krasnodar, Belarus, and the Baltics. In 1943 she flew on numerous resupply missions to send ammunition, paratroopers, and provisions to forces in Eltigen, Crimea through heavy autumn storms and heavy enemy fire. In 1943 the 588th Night Bomber Regiment was honored with the Guards designation and renamed the 46th Guards Night Bomber Regiment. By October 1943 she had completed 390 sorties. On a mission over Kerch on 31 December 1943, she narrowly survived a mission when her Po-2 piloted by Vera Tikhomirova was hit by flak and caught fire. The plane began to lose altitude and Tikhomirova was prepared to carry out ditching at sea but managed to safely land the plane in friendly territory. Having been promoted to the position of squadron navigator in September 1944, she helped train new navigators in addition to regular combat duties, and distinguished herself as an excellent teacher for quickly training eight ground crew personnel as navigators. By the end of the war she totaled 725 combat sorties, dropping 108 tonnes of bombs, more than half of which she navigated for Mariya Smirnova.
Nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 10 May 1945, she never received the title despite opinions in favor of awarding her it from several high-ranking military officers reviewing the nomination including Konstantin Vershinin and Konstantin Rokossovsky; she was subsequently awarded an Order of the Patriotic War 1st class instead.
Later life.
Upon entering the reserve in October 1945 due to the end of the war and went on to study editorializing and publishing at the Moscow State University of Printing Arts. She and a fellow veteran from her unit, Raisa Aronova were admitted to the Union of Journalists of the USSR. For 15 years she worked as an editor for the "Physical Culture and Sport" publishing house before writing for the newspaper "Soviet Patriot" and later the "Znanie" publishing house. In 1976 she published a book about the lives of two of her veteran friends friends Hero of the Soviet Union Yekaterina Ryabova and her husband, twice Hero of the Soviet Union Grigory Sivkov. Sumarokova often engaged in public speaking after the war, especially to youth groups. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and her nomination for the gold star came up again, she was awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation in 1995. She died on 28 May 1997 in Moscow and was buried in the Kuntsevo Cemetery.

Becoming Warren Buffett

Becoming Warren Buffett is a 2017 documentary film about the Warren Buffett and his life. The film was made for HBO.
Plot.
The documentary covers the life and career of Warren Buffett, who is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential investors of the 20th Century. 
Buffett is interviewed extensively on his upbringing, his early facility with mathematics and interest in investing, and his time as a young adult studying under Benjamin Graham to learn the principles of value investing (which are outlined with a series of short animated segments). 
Buffett's friends, family and colleagues are featured in interviews, including his wife Susan Buffett and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger.
Critical reception.
"The New Yorker" analyzed the dichotomy between Warren Buffett's investing prowess and personal relationship skills. The review commented, "There’s another paradox the film hints at, too: the qualities that made it challenging for Buffett to deal with people are the very qualities that made him such a brilliant investor." "The New Yorker" observed, "It’s also about an ability to divorce yourself from emotion, to be rational at a time when other people are acting irrationally, and to be calm when others are fearful."
"The New York Times" noted the documentary told Buffett's biography "in a relatively new way". The review commented that, though the overall portrayal of the man was positive, it also described Buffett, "as something of a remarkable human computer, gifted with numbers and less so with interpersonal relationships."
"Money" observed the film is, "Chock full of the traditionalist eccentricities the 'oracle of Omaha' is best known for–like his love of Coca Cola, and the fact that he lives in the same house he bought in 1958 for $31,500". "Money" pointed out that the documentary went more in-depth than these specifics about Buffett, and "reveals a surprising set of facts even Buffett die hards may have missed."
According to the film critic news aggregation analysis on Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary garnered positive reviews from the "Los Angeles Times" and "The Washington Post", and a negative review from "Entertainment Weekly".

Yulte Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Myponga about south of the state capital of Adelaide and about south-south-east of the town of Myponga.
The conservation park consists of land in section 268 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Myponga. It came into existence on 24 January 1974 by proclamation under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:A small park in steep, hilly terrain vegetated with open forest of "Eucalyptus baxteri" in association with "E. Obliqua", "E Leucoxylon" and "E Fasciculosa" in the valleys. This association grades through to a scrub / heath of "E. baxteri" / "E. osmophylla" on the ridges. The understorey is typically a dense heath dominated by "Xanthorrhoea", "Pultenaea" and "Casuarina" species, with "Banksia ornata" confined to the ridges. A wide diversity of bird species typical of the Adelaide hills area is represented in the park, including the uncommon beautiful firetail. The park is in a minimally disturbed condition, however its small size and cleared surrounds make it susceptible to deleterious external influences.

Consort Zhang (Renzong)

Noble Consort Zhang (張貴妃, personal name unknown, 1024–1054), posthumously Empress Wencheng (溫成皇后), was an imperial concubine of Emperor Renzong of Song. She was the emperor's favorite concubine, but did not become an empress (at least during her life) due to the strong opposition of the emperor's "mother" Empress Dowager Liu.
Childhood.
Lady Zhang was the daughter of Zhang Yaofeng and Lady Cao and she had two younger sisters. Zhang Yaofeng was a scholar and died early, and Lady Cao wanted to take her daughter to Zhang Yaofeng's brother, Zhang Yaozuo (张尧佐). Zhang Yaozuo stated that the distance for the mother and daughter to travel was too far and refused. Lady Cao eventually became a dancer for the Princess of Jing (荆国大长公主). The Princess of Jing was the daughter of Emperor Taizong and Noble Consort Fang and was known for her similarities to her father. She noticed that Lady Zhang was beautiful, and took her into the palace at the age of 8 along with her sisters. Lady Zhang was raised by Lady Jia, a palace attendant.
Consort.
Lady Zhang was renowned for her beauty, and she attracted the attention of Emperor Renzong at a banquet. She was favored for her dancing and attentiveness to the Emperor. Lady Zhang was his favorite out of all the consorts in the harem. She gave birth to his first daughter Princess Anshou (安壽公主, 1040–1042) and was given the rank of "Cairen". Princess Anshou was the Emperor's favorite daughter until her death. Lady Zhang was promoted to the rank of "Xiuyuan" (修媛). Lady Zhang gave birth to her second daughter Princess Baohe (寶和公主, 1042–1043), but she soon died too. As a result, Lady Zhang was demoted to the title of "Meiren". She gave birth to her third daughter Princess Tangguo (唐國公主, 1044–1045), but her last child also died in infancy.
Consort Zhang's mother Lady Cao was styled Lady of Qinghe (清河郡夫人) by Emperor Renzong. Her uncle Zhang Yaozuo was appointed as an official at the Southern Court of Xianhui. Zhang Yaozuo was constantly promoted, and went from being a 7th rank to a 6th rank official. This led to the opposition of several officials, such as Bao Zheng. That same year, Consort Zhang received the honorable title of "Guifei", one rank from the Empress. She was known to love eating kumquat, and this sparked competition in markets.
Noble Consort Zhang passed away at the age of 31, around the new year. Emperor Renzong grieved her for seven days and composed poems for her. He dressed her in the robes of an Empress, which caused the opposition of many officials since Empress Cao was alive. Noble Consort Zhang always wanted to become Empress, and her dream was fulfilled after she died. She was honored as Empress Wencheng, and Emperor Renzong bestowed her mother the title of Lady Qi (齐国夫人) and Zhang Yaozuo the senior advisor.

On January 15, Michigan defeated Maryland 68–67. After trailing by 14 points in the first half and 10 points at halftime, Michigan was trailing by 7 points in the second half when they made 7 consecutive three-point shots, including three by Poole whose 11 points made him one of only two double digit scorers for Michigan. For the February 3 contest against Minnesota, the Maize Rage (Michigan's student section) held a "Poole party" in the stands, but Poole missed all four of his field goal attempts. Poole finished the regular season with three straight double digit scoring efforts, making 9 of 12 three-point shots against (#8 AP Poll/#9 Coaches Poll) Ohio State on February 18, Penn State on February 21, and Maryland on February 24. On March 4, a victory over (#8 AP Poll/#8 Coaches Poll) Purdue gave Michigan its second consecutive Big Ten Tournament championship since the game was the championship game of the 2018 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, even though Poole slumped during the 4-game run, missing all 9 of his three-point shots.

The shot was described as nearly identical to the buzzer beater he had made a year earlier in the Dick's National Championship game. Poole finished the game with 8 points and 2 rebounds, but his only field goal attempt in his four minutes of play in the second half was the game-winner. The play began with Michigan trailing by two points with 3.6 seconds remaining in the game and Isaiah Livers passing the ball from under the opposite basket to Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman near midcourt. After two dribbles Abdur-Rahkman threw the ball to Poole with 2 seconds left. The term "Poole party" was widely used in the press as a play on words to describe the celebration of Poole's heroic shot. In the March 31, 2018 national semifinal against Loyola–Chicago Poole had seven points, including the free throws that put the team the ahead for good after rallying back from a 10-point second half deficit.

George Frederick Keller

George Frederick Keller (1846–?) was a cartoonist active in California, known as the primary illustrator of the San Francisco satirical magazine "The Wasp". Born in Prussia, he emigrated to the United States and fought in the U.S. Civil War, settling in California around 1870. He apprenticed to lithographer George Baker, where his first job was lithographing colorful cigar box labels. He joined "The Wasp", also founded by Prussian immigrants, with its first issue, debuting in August 1876. Some of his work reflected the anti-Chinese and anti-immigrant sentiment of late 19th-Century San Francisco in highly racialized stereotypes, depicting Chinese as rat-like invaders, Irish as Neanderthals, and Jews as hook-nosed moneylenders. Keller's final cartoon was published June 30, 1883, after which he left the San Francisco area "and was never heard from again".

Viktor Krivulin

Viktor Borisovich Krivulin (; 9 July 1944 – 17 March 2001) was a Russian poet, novelist and essayist.
Biography.
Krivulin graduated from the faculty of philology from Leningrad State University. He opted for independent cultural activity and worked mostly as a watchman, editor of short living leaflets of sanitary education while heading some important institutions of Russian uncensored literature of 1970s, such as «37» and «Severnaya Pochta» samizdat magazines among others. Later Krivulin was involved with other samizdat journals Obvodnyi Kanal and Chasy, the journal of the Leningrad alternative culture club «Klub-81».
In 1978 Krivulin became the first winner of Andrei Bely independent literary prize and then for more than ten years he participated in running this award.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union Krivulin served as co-chairman of the St Petersburg branch of the Democratic Russia party, where he worked with the reformer Galina Starovoitova murdered in November 1998.
Work.
Krivulin’s poetic output reflects some features of the postmodern current that has been variously labelled as neomodernism and metarealism. For many years, his poetry circulated exclusively in samizdat (Leningrad journals such as Chasy [The Clock], «37» and Obvodnyi kanal), as well as the émigré journals Grani ("Facets"), Tret’ia volna ("The Third Wave"), Vestnik RKhD ("Herald of the Russian Christian Movement") and Kontinent.
Krivulin’s first poetry collection was published in 1981 in Paris and was followed with the two volumes of selected poems released in 1988. His first official Soviet publication appeared only in 1985 in the pages of the club’s anthology, Krug. Krivulin’s first book in the Soviet Union was published in 1990.
Personal life.
Krivulin was married several times. His first wife was the philosopher Tatyana Goricheva, with whom they organized unofficial seminars and edited the journal 37, named after the number of their communal apartment. In 60s before getting married with Goricheva, Krivulin started a relationship with Masha Ivashintsova, clandestine street photographer whose works were discovered by her relatives in the family attic and made public. They were breaking up and getting back together several times until Masha’s death in 2000.

Greene 1909 Biplane

The Greene 1909 Biplane was an American pioneering aircraft.
In 1909, at the Morris Park Raceway, Dr. William Greene constructed a biplane that successfully flew for the first time on October 28, 1909. The aircraft was in the Curtiss style with dual forward elevators and dual trailing rudders and a tricycle landing gear.
Design and development.
Greene constructed his first successful aircraft during the summer of 1909. Originally equipped with a 29 hp American &amp; British automobile motor, he flew for the first time on October 28, 1909. During this flight he discovered that he had placed the engine, which weighed 320 lbs, too far to the rear and had to attach 80 lbs of sandbags to the front of the plane to balance it. His longest solo flight on this day was 600 ft 
In November, Greene re-engined the aircraft with a lighter Kimball 2 cycle motor of 40 hp. On November 15 of the same year, he took up a passenger for the first time. After a series of exhibition flights at Morris Park, he sold the plane to Wilbur R. Kimball. He took it to Rahway, New Jersey where he and Frank Boland took the tail off of it and began experimenting with a novel control system that eventually led to the first Boland Brothers 'jibbed' tailless biplane.
During his flights at Morris Park in November, Dr. Greene set the world record for shortest take off at 30 ft.

Huajian Group, a Chinese shoe making company hiring thousands of workers in Ethiopia, was portrayed in the film as a model of "introducing China's experience of prosperity to Africa." According to a report of the Associated Press, however, the company's Ethiopian workers complained about low wages, the lack of safety equipment, forced labor and not being permitted to form a trade union.
The documentary ends with a song performed by pop singer Sun Nan.
Production.
The film was co-produced by China Central Television and China Film Co., Ltd, both state-owned enterprises, and directed by Wei Tie.
Release.
The film was released in Mainland China on March 2, 2018, distributed by Alibaba Pictures. It was reported by "South China Morning Post" that some state companies and government-affiliated organizations required employees to watch the film. On 19 April 2018, the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China issued a memo requesting that Chinese websites and cinemas stop showing the film.
The film was screened in a theater in Macao from May 9 to May 14, 2018.
Reception.
Douban, the leading film review website in China, disabled the commenting and rating functions on the film's page, instead showing a "media rating" of 8.5/10 and reviews written by state media including "Xinhua" and the "People's Daily."
Internationally, it is widely considered to be a propaganda film, and an effort by the Communist Party of China to increase its soft power. The film also is believed to be a significant step towards a personality cult of Xi Jinping by some observers. While "Amazing China" does demonstrate a new level of sophistication in state propaganda, along with other self-congratulatory representations of China's growth "betrays an unshakeable anxiety about the continuing legitimacy of CCP rule."

African Continental Free Trade Area

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is a free trade area founded in 2018, with trade commencing as of 1 January 2021. It was created by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement among 54 of the 55 African Union nations.
The free-trade area is the largest in the world in terms of the number of participating countries since the formation of the World Trade Organization. Accra, Ghana serves as the Secretariat of AfCFTA and was commissioned and handed over to the AU by the President of Ghana Nana Akufo-Addo on August 17, 2020 in Accra.
The agreement was brokered by the African Union (AU) and was signed on by 44 of its 55 member states in Kigali, Rwanda on March 21, 2018. The agreement initially requires members to remove tariffs from 90% of goods, allowing free access to commodities, goods, and services across the continent. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa estimates that the agreement will boost intra-African trade by 52 percent by 2022. The proposal was set to come into force 30 days after ratification by 22 of the signatory states. On April 2, 2019, The Gambia became the 22nd state to ratify the agreement, and on April 29 the Saharawi Republic made the 22nd deposit of instruments of ratification; the agreement went into force on May 30 and entered its operational phase following a summit on July 7, 2019.
The general objectives of the agreement are to:
History.
Background.
In 1963 the Organization of African Unity was founded by the independent states of Africa. The OAU aimed to promote cooperation between African states. The 1980 Lagos Plan of Action was adopted by the organization. The plan suggested Africa should minimize reliance upon the West by promoting intra-African trade. This began as the creation of a number of regional cooperation organizations in the different regions of Africa, such as the Southern African Development Coordination Conference. Eventually this led to the Abuja Treaty in 1991, which created the African Economic Community, an organization that promoted the development of free trade areas, customs unions, an African Central Bank, and an African common currency union.
In 2002, the OAU was succeeded by the African Union (AU), which had as one of its goals to accelerate the "economic integration of the continent". A second goal was to "coordinate and harmonize the policies between the existing and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the Union."
Negotiations.
At the 2012 African Union summit in Addis Ababa, leaders agreed to create a new Continental Free Trade Area by 2017. At the 2015 AU summit in Johannesburg, the summit agreed to commence negotiations. This began a series of ten negotiating sessions which took place over the next three years.
The first negotiation forum was held in February 2016 and held eight meetings until the Summit in March 2018 in Kigali. From February 2017 on the technical working groups held four meetings, where technical issues were discussed and implemented in the draft. On March 8–9, 2018 the African Union Ministers of Trade approved the draft.
2018 Kigali Summit.
In March 2018, at the 10th Extraordinary Session of the African Union on AfCFTA, three separate agreements were signed: the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, the Kigali Declaration; and the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons. The Protocol on Free Movement of Persons seeks to establish a visa-free zone within the AfCFTA countries, and support the creation of the African Union Passport. At the summit in Kigali on 21 March 2018, 44 countries signed the AfCFTA, 47 signed the Kigali Declaration, and 30 signed the Protocol on Free Movement of People. While a success, there were two notable holdouts: Nigeria and South Africa, the two largest economies in Africa.
One complicating factor in the negotiations was that Africa had already been divided into eight separate free trade areas and/or customs unions, each with different regulations. These regional bodies will continue to exist; the African Continental Free Trade Agreement initially seeks to reduce trade barriers between the different pillars of the African Economic Community, and eventually use these regional organizations as building blocks for the ultimate goal of an Africa-wide customs union.
Drafting of further protocols.
Negotiations continued in 2018 with Phase II, including policies of investment, competition and intellectual property rights. In January 2020, AU Assembly negotiations are envisaged to be concluded. A draft is expected for the January 2020 AU Assembly.
Institutions.
The following institutions were established to facilitate the implementation of the free trade area. As a result of Phase II negotiations more committees may be established via protocols.
The AfCFTA Secretariat will be responsible for coordinating the implementation of the agreement and shall be an autonomous body within the AU system. Though it will have independent legal personality, it shall work closely with the AU Commission and receive its budget from the AU. The Council of Ministers responsible for trade will decide on the location of the headquarter, structure, role and responsibilities.
The Assembly of the African Union Heads of State and Government is the highest decision-making body. It is likely to meet during the AU Summits. The Council of Ministers Responsible for Trade provides strategic trade policy oversight and ensures effective implementation and enforcement of the AfCFTA Agreement.
Several committees have been established, for trade in goods, trade in services, on rules of origin, trade remedies, non-tariff barriers, technical barriers to trade and on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Dispute resolution rules and procedures are still being negotiated, but will presumably include designation of a dispute resolution body. The Committee of Senior Trade Officials implements the Council's decisions. The Committee is responsible for the development of programs and action plans for the implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement.
Implementation.
The AfCFTA is set to be implemented in phases, and some of the future phases still under negotiation.
At the Kigali summit, areas of agreement were found on trade protocols, dispute settlement procedures, customs cooperation, trade facilitation, and rules of origin. This was part of Phase I of the agreement, which covers goods and services liberalization. There was also agreement to reduce tariffs on 90% of all goods. Each nation is permitted to exclude 3% of goods from this agreement.
The 12th Extraordinary Session of the African Union on AfCFTA was called to launch the new agreement into its operational phase, which was hosted in Niamey on 7 July 2019.
At its launch, five operational instruments that will govern the AfCFTA were activated: "the rules of origin; the online negotiating forum; the monitoring and elimination of non-tariff barriers; a digital payment system; and the African Trade Observatory."
Some Phase One issues that remain to be negotiated include the schedule of tariff concessions and other specific commitments. Negotiations are also underway to see which city will host the AfCFTA.
Negotiations for Phase II began in February 2019. These negotiations will cover protocols for competition, intellectual property, and investment. Negotiations on Phase II issues are expected to finish in 2020.
After months of delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, the AfCFTA officially but largely symbolically launched on January 1, 2021.
Membership.
As of July 2019, 54 of the 55 African Union states had signed the agreement, with Eritrea the only country not signing the agreement. Of these member states 27 have deposited their instrument of ratification.
After the Kigali summit, more signatures were added to the AfCFTA. At the African Union summit in Nouakchott on 1 July 2018, five more nations joined the agreement, including South Africa. Kenya and Ghana were the first nations to ratify the agreement, depositing their ratification on 10 May 2018. Of the signatories, 22 needed to ratify the agreement for it to come into effect, and this occurred on 29 April 2019 when both Sierra Leone and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ratified the agreement. As a result, the agreement came into force 30 days later on 30 May 2019; at this point, only Benin, Nigeria, and Eritrea had not signed. Outstanding issues like the trade concession agreements and rules of origin remain under negotiation.
Eritrea was not part of the initial agreement due to an ongoing state of war, but the 2018 peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea ended the conflict and ended the barrier to Eritrean participation in the free trade agreement. The unrecognized state of Somaliland was not a party to the discussions related to the creation of the agreement.
At this summit, Benin and Nigeria signed the agreement, leaving Eritrea as the only African state not a part of this agreement; Eritrea has since asked to join the agreement. Gabon and Equatorial Guinea also deposited their ratification at this summit. At the date of the launch, there were 27 states who had ratified the agreement.
South Africa, Sierra Leone, Namibia, Lesotho and Burundi have since signed the AfCFTA during the 31st African Union Summit in Nouakchott. As of July 2019, 54 states have signed the agreement.
Nigerian opposition.
Nigeria was one of the last nations to sign the agreement. At 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and has about the population of the second and third most-populous countries, Ethiopia and Egypt, combined, each of which have a population around 98 million. With a nominal GDP of US$376 billion, or around 17% of Africa's GDP, it is just ahead of South Africa, which accounts for 16% of Africa's economy. Because Nigeria is such a significant country in terms of its population and its economy, its absence at the initial signing of the agreement was particularly conspicuous. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa underscored that in comments on 12 July 2018 and commented, "The continent is waiting for Nigeria and South Africa. By trading among ourselves, we are able to retain more resources in the continent." South Africa later signed the agreement.
44 countries initially signed the agreement on 21 March 2018. Nigeria was one of 11 African Union nations to avoid initially signing. At the time, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that Nigeria could not do anything that would undermine local manufacturers and entrepreneurs. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, which represents 3,000 Nigerian manufacturers, praised the decision to back out of the agreement. The Nigerian foreign minister tweeted that more domestic consultation was needed before Nigeria could sign the agreement. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo said Nigeria's delay was regrettable. The Nigeria Labour Congress called the agreement a "renewed, extremely dangerous and radioactive neoliberal policy initiative", suggesting increased economic pressure would pressure workers into migration under difficult and unsafe conditions.
On 21 July 2018, five more nations signed the agreement, including South Africa. At that time, the Nigerian government emphasized its non-participation was a delay, not a withdrawal, and promised to soon sign the agreement. As the foreign minister had earlier emphasized, the Nigerian government intended to consult further with local businesses in order to ensure private sector buy-in to the agreement.
As the Nigerian government continued to consult with local business groups in the latter half of 2018, a key concern was whether the agreement adequately prevented anti-competitive practices such as dumping. As 2018 drew to a close, former President Olusegun Obasanjo said the delay was "regrettable", emphasizing the lack of trade in goods amongst African countries, the difficulties in travelling from one African country to another, and the colonial legacy which these restrictions on Africa's growth represented. The government steering committee in charge of the consultative process was due to release its report on the agreement in January 2019.
Nigeria's president announced on 2 July 2019 that Nigeria would sign the AfCFTA in Niger the following week. Nigeria signed the AfCFTA on 7 July 2019.
Current Status.
Most AU member states have signed the agreement. Benin, Botswana, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, and Zambia did not initially sign the agreement. President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari was particularly reluctant to join if it hurt Nigerian entrepreneurship and industry. On July 7, 2019 Nigeria and Benin committed to signing the Africa free trade at the 12th extraordinary session of the assembly of the union on AfCFTA; leaving Eritrea as the only nation out of the 55 African Union Member States not to sign up to the deal.
The African Continental Free Trade Area did not come into effect until 22 of the signing countries ratified the agreement, which occurred in April 2019 when The Gambia became the 22nd country to ratify it. As of August 2020, there are 54 signatories, of which at least 30 have ratified and 28 have deposited their instruments of ratification. The three countries that have ratified but not yet deposited their ratification are reported to be Cameroon, Angola, and Somalia though Morocco enacted a law authorizing ratification in 2019. 
Other AU member states.
Eritrea has not signed due to tensions with Ethiopia, but following the 2018 Eritrea–Ethiopia summit the AU Commissioner for Trade and Industry now expects Eritrea to sign the agreement.
Human rights assessment.
A July 2017 United Nations Economic Commission for Africa report argues that the CFTA may contribute to tackling poverty and inequality as its wide scope will facilitate structural changes in African economies. It is seen as a step towards meeting the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals. The document was targeted to ensuring human rights were considered within the negotiations.

VARS2

Valyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial is a protein that in humans is encoded by the VARS2 gene.
Function.
This gene encodes a mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, which catalyzes the attachment of valine to tRNA(Val) for mitochondrial translation. Mutations in this gene cause combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-20, and are also associated with early-onset mitochondrial encephalopathies. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2014].

Jarek Kolář and Petr Vlček began working on the game in 1992 using school computers in the gymnasium of Slovanské náměstí in Brno where they were students. They wanted to use their own game-making tools as well as the ZX Spectrum tools they had been working with. In 1993, Petr Vochozka sold the first-ever Czech commercial adventure game for the Amiga entitled "Světák Bob". Later that year, he founded Polička-based Vochozka Trading and released "Tajemství Oslího ostrova" as the publisher's debut title.
Development.
Development took place between 1992 and 1994. In the first year, the developers used their school computer after receiving permission from their computer science teacher. They faced several challenges, as there was limited information on how to make video games available to developers.
Visual assets from other adventure games were used, which, years later in 2018, caused the magazine "Excalibur" to express surprise that there were no licensing issues. However, the game's sound effects were created by the developers themselves using computer speakers. "Tajemství Oslího ostrova" was also one of the first Czech games to feature developed graphics.
Release.
Originally, Kolář and Vlček had no plans to make the game commercially available. They created it to prove that Czech citizens could create a game on par with international productions. They did not care if the game was released commercially or as freeware, but after seeing an advert by Vochozka in "Excalibur", the only Czech game magazine at the time, they joined Vochozka under the Pterodon Software brand. The game sold 2,000 copies for 240 crowns each, a considerable increase on "Světák Bob", which had sold only a few hundred copies. Vochozka set up an exclusive contract to spread the games of the Pterodon team.
The retail version of the game was originally wrapped only in a plastic bag. A paper-box edition was not available until November of the same year, at which point the second Pterodon Software game was released entitled "7 dní a 7 nocí". The game was released only five years after the Velvet Revolution, when only a small fraction of Czech society understood English. By the end of 1996, Vochozka Trading had produced twelve games.
Plot and gameplay.
The player takes control of the Guybrush Threepwood parody Gajbraš Trípvůd, who, after an unsuccessful pirate raid, is on the run from LeChuck parody LeGek.
Critical reception and legacy.
According to IDNES.cz, the game changed not only Vochozka's life but also the entire Czech gaming scene. The site felt the title had a significant impact in kick-starting the local video game industry. Star-hry gave it a rating of 91%.
Objevit felt the game was pioneering, as it was created during a time when few knew Czechs knew how to create computer games and when little documentation or tools were available to teach burgeoning developers. Hernisvet wrote that upon release, the game surprised Czech audiences with its "sophisticated play" and "excellent, completely original themes", noting that even in 2005 the game still held value in the Czech freeware scene. Dovus considers "Tajemství Oslího ostrova" to be one of the major events in gaming prehistory. "Gamepark" felt the title was filled with "brilliant humor, pirate stories and beautiful cartoon graphics and great adventures".
"Gamesite" thought that a big drawback to "Tajemství Oslího ostrova" was the lack of a musical score except in the opening credits. "Gamez.cz" described it as a simple game that deserves to be buried in the modern era, though noted its success in sales. "Bonusweb" thought that while the game was "hilarious", older reviews in magazines like "Excalibur", which gave the game a rating of 95%, were greatly exaggerated. The "Excalibur" review was written by Vochozka, the game's publisher. "Bonusweb" wrote that despite the game's rough edges, its gameplay, low price, and charm as one of the first Czech games led to players overlooking its weaknesses and making it a hit.
Bonusweb argues that the game is the first Czech commercial game for personal computers and a historic milestone in the home gaming scene.

Wag (company)

Wag Labs (better known as simply Wag!) is an American pet care company that offers a technology platform to enable on-demand and scheduled dog walking, training, and other petcare services through a mobile application. According to its website, Wag! services are insured and every pet caregiver passes through a vetting process and extensive background check before being approved to accept work on the platform. The app has been referred to as "the Uber for Dogs". The company’s tagline is “Wag! creates joy for dogs and those who love them.” Wag! donates a portion of walk proceeds to GreaterGood.org’s Rescue Bank and has, to date, provided more than 10 million meals to shelter dogs in the US.
History.
Wag! was founded in 2015 in Los Angeles, California. In early 2018, Wag! raised $300 million in venture capital funds from Softbank. The company had previously raised $68 million in venture capital.
Celebrity users include Mariah Carey, Kendall Jenner, and Chloë Grace Moretz. Actress Olivia Munn serves as an investor and Creative Strategist.
In December 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported SoftBank sold its entire $300 million stake in Wag Labs back to the company at an investment loss.
Criticisms and incidents.
In June 2017, a Wag! contractor was videotaped allegedly "making himself at home" in a user's apartment, including resting on a sofa and taking beers. In November 2017, a Wag! contractor was videotaped allegedly stealing packages from a New York City apartment building. The "New York Daily News" reported on a dog lost by Wag! in September 2017, and later finding the pet weeks later.
In February 2020, a Yorkie named Bella was found dead after a Wag! Service. Wag! responded with a statement that included “safety is a company-wide priority for Wag! and incidents of this nature are very rare. In fact, the average service rating on the Wag! platform is 4.97 (on a 5-point scale), and every 8 seconds a service is booked on Wag! – with 90% of Wag! customers booking a service weekly.”
Response to COVID-19.
In March of 2020, Wag! created a new service type called Wag! Now for miscellaneous pet care needs for pet owners in San Francisco. The service was later released to the entire United States and Wag! partnered with GreaterGood.Org to create the #stayhomeandfoster initiative, connecting independent contractors with dog and cat rescues and shelters to deliver supplies and foster pets to foster homes. As part of the initiative, Olivia Munn connected Henry Golding "with Wag! and GreaterGood.org. The two groups were able to find Golding the perfect match in Stella, a shelter dog from START Animal Rescue." The last week of February 2020, Wag! made the decision to have all employees begin working from home across all office locations and released communications to pet owners and independent contractors on how best to complete socially distanced walks. According to Adweek, “pet care app Wag sent an email to its users encouraging pet owners to limit interaction with dog walkers by communicating through the in-app chat feature and having the dog’s harness and leash on ahead of time, making for a ‘simple handoff.’ The company also provides small lockboxes to pet owners who request them, making the exchange of household keys a no-contact situation—’essentially, a built-in social distance feature,’ said a Wag spokesperson. According to Wag, nearly 70% of its services are completed with a lockbox or hidden key.”

Lost in Japan

"Lost in Japan" is a song recorded by Canadian singer Shawn Mendes. It was written by Mendes, Scott Harris, Nate Mercereau and Teddy Geiger, with production handled by Mendes, Mercereau, Geiger and Louis Bell. The song was released by Island Records on March 23, 2018, as a second single for Mendes' self-titled third studio album. An official remix by German music producer Zedd was released on September 27, 2018.
Release.
The song's title was first spotted in the background of Mendes' Instagram posts from when he was recording the album in Jamaica, leading to speculation on the possibility of Mendes releasing two singles, hence the two dates in an earlier teaser. He announced the song mere hours after the release of "In My Blood", writing on Twitter: "Wanted to give you another song".
Composition.
"Lost in Japan" is a funk, pop and R&amp;B song, with "funky strings and driving bass" that bears resemblances to the work of Justin Timberlake. During interviews, Mendes stated that he was inspired by all of the Timberlake songs he was listening to at the time, especially "Justified"–and a dream. "I had this dream that I was lost in this country and I woke up the next day and we had this cool piano part and the song was birthed."
Lars Brandle of "Billboard" wrote that the song "opens with a subtle spell of piano then changes gears with a fat bass sound and groove". It transformed from "a slow, piano-driven number" into "a passionate, hook-laden love song", according to CBS Radio's Robyn Collins. Lyrically, Mendes offers to travel the globe in order to be closer to his love interest.
Critical reception.
Mike Nied of Idolator regarded the "atmospheric" song as "another solid gold bop", complimenting its ability "to present a new, more mature version of the superstar". Sam Damshenas of "Gay Times" opined that the song "displays a saucier, funkier side" to Mendes. Jordan Sargent of "Spin" praised the track, deeming it "notably well-made pop music" and "refreshingly spacious," despite being ambivalent towards his previous single "In My Blood". "Billboard" named it the 22nd best song of the first half of 2018, "Elle" considered it the 2nd, while "Uproxx" listed it at No. 8 for the best pop songs of 2018.

Zedd remix.
A remix of "Lost in Japan" by Zedd was released on September 27, 2018, and was sent to the US contemporary hit radio on October 2, 2018.
Music video.
A music video for the song was released on October 25, 2018. The video features both the original and remix versions of the song. The music video reenacts scenes from the 2003 film "Lost in Translation," where Mendes plays the role of Bob (originally portrayed by Bill Murray)"." It features guest appearances from Norwegian actress Alisha Boe (who plays Scarlett Johansson's character Charlotte) and remixer Zedd. The music video was directed by Jay Martin and shot by Kai Saul.

Da share z0ne

@dasharez0ne (also known as da share z0ne, Da motha fuckin share z0ne, da z0ne, DSZ, and other variations) is a social media account on Twitter and Facebook, known for posting image macros pairing skeleton art and absurdist or ironic captions. Da share z0ne's posts are an elaborate parody of online hyper-masculinity; specifically, da share z0ne's posts mimic "tough guy" memes with characteristics like macho posturing, poor graphic design, and juvenile fondness for generically "cool" imagery like skeletons, leather jackets, grim reapers, tombstones, flames, and guns.
The creator or creators of da share z0ne operate anonymously. The account is supposedly operated by a fictitious skeleton character known as Admin. All the posts, as well responses to press inquiries, are made in-character as Admin. In ironic contrast to the over-the-top macho aesthetic of the imagery, the Admin character himself is neurotic, emotionally sensitive, "woke", and preoccupied with mundane aspects of everyday life. The juxtaposition provides much of the satirical effect.
Journalists have praised da share z0ne for its distinct, off-kilter brand of humor and the rich characterization of Admin. In 2018, da share z0ne launched an original trading card game called "The Devil's Level" with the help of artistic collaborators, including fellow Twitter user dril, Drew Fairweather, and numerous comics artists.
Social media posts.
Da share z0ne began posting in September 2015. The account is best-known for image macros that combine artwork of skeletons, compiled from various Internet sources, with superimposed captions in assorted typefaces. The account is loosely affiliated with the "Weird Twitter" subculture. The account is an extended parody of a particular style of overtly masculine meme page on social media. In the words of "The A.V. Club"s Gabe Worgaftik, the target of its parody is "the kind of Facebook page that posts tough-guy memes over pictures of skeletons that your fuck-up cousin shares ... this generation's version of a 'Keep honking, I'm reloading' bumper sticker." Writing for "Dazed", Luke O'Neil called da share z0ne a "riff on the style of toxic masculinity that can be found on specific corners of the meme-based internet ... where dudes are dudes, motorcycles and guns kick ass, and everything you need to know about a guy can be crammed onto a horribly designed image macro of clashing fonts, unreadable texts, and shoddy looking graphics."
In November 2018, "The Columbus Dispatch" reported that webcomic artist Drew Fairweather runs da share z0ne.
In February 2020, Admin posted several tweets endorsing Bernie Sanders for the Democratic primary in 2020.
Visual aesthetic.
Da share z0ne posts are characterized by purposefully poor graphic design, using multiple tacky fonts in a single image and a different watermark in almost every image. The visual style of da share z0ne was described by "Slate"s Jacob Brogan as a "borderline comical gothic aesthetic" with a "mock-fascination with fatalist cool," but with "silly" captions that "operate in winkingly awkward contradistinction to the pictures." "Motherboard"s Rachel Pick called the account's aesthetic a "mash-up of what guys who own Harleys and stoned 14-year-olds think looks cool." According to Zack Boehm of "Uloop", a typical da share z0ne meme is a "configuration of the following: The gaunt visage of a demonic skeleton (this is a DSZ staple), fire, guns, motorcycles, leather jackets, Viking garb, laptops, and short missives like 'Why do bad people get to have good pets?' or 'Thinkin about getting really into Japan' spelled out in Windows '95 word art."
Archer Angel at "The Daily Dot" compared da share z0ne's format to the approach pioneered by Gangster Popeye, a satirical page likewise "inspired by the 'tough guy' memes from pages like KrazyTrain and Check Dis Shit Out—macros that feature text on themes such as being a badass and not taking shit from anyone, superimposed on pictures of skeletons (often holding weapons)." Roisin Kiberd of "Motherboard" connected da share z0ne within a history of repurposing skeleton art in Internet culture—"memetic "memento mori""—dating back to the 1990s.
"Admin" character.
Da share z0ne is run by an anonymous person or group of people. The fictional character who purportedly runs da share z0ne is a skeleton named Admin. The creator or creators of da share z0ne respond in-character as Admin to press inquiries, and Admin has given interviews with Herb.co, "Dazed", Vice Media's "Motherboard", "Newsweek", and "New York" magazine. In his posts and other messages, Admin usually types in all caps with numerous misspellings.
Admin has been described as an everyman (or "every-skeleton") character whose "relatable" struggles mirror everyday struggles and the impact of Internet culture on his generation. Admin hates his job, enjoys marijuana, and has lowbrow taste. In da share z0ne posts, Admin has complained of irritable bowel syndrome, experiences of social anxiety, and depression. Admin frequently breaks the fourth wall in posts; for example, they describes running da share z0ne itself, boasts about their inflated sense of the account's popularity, references their own computer problems, and accidentally types out and submits web searches as tweets. Miles Klee wrote that the Admin's defining trait is their "nerdy white-collar warriorhood."
An important aspect of Admin's persona is their social consciousness; Kiberd described Admin as an "unlikely—but lovable—social justice hero." The character's usage and love of hyper-masculine imagery ironically contrasts with their actual personality, which is neurotic, unintelligent, awkward, and lonely, yet also deeply sensitive, essentially decent, and even socially conscious. Diverging from the latent racism, misogyny, homophobia and transphobia commonly found on the pages that da share z0ne parodies, Admin "explicitly performs 'wokeness'" with consciousness-raising, albeit "deeply campy," slogans in its posts on topics such as gender, immigration, refugees, consent, and safe spaces. Admin's socially conscious posts are, according to Emily Gaudette at "Newsweek", "like reading the private thoughts of a liberal goth kid whose taste in art hasn't yet caught up to their advanced understanding of mental health and politics."
The detailed characterization of Admin—particularly the stark contrast between their character and the "cool" imagery—supplies much of da share z0ne's ironic humor and satirical content. Boehm notes that the "jarring dissonance" between Admin's "vulnerable, pitiable" text and the "gothic, biker-horror imagery" is crucial to the page's satirical effect, applying the creators' knowledge of "the kind of strange macho, anonymously aggressive internet culture that [da share z0ne is] trying to spoof" to "deftly needle at the hypocritical constructs of masculinity with a gnarled, bony skeleton finger." O'Neil writes that the contrast reveals the subtext of loneliness behind the online "tough guy" archetype that Admin caricatures. Jay Hathaway at "The Daily Dot" wrote that a "character-driven Twitter account hasn't blended macho attitude and complete personal dysfunction this perfectly" since Karl Welzein (@dadboner), a Twitter character written by comedian Mike Burns who is "a divorced, middle-aged Detroit dude who loves to rock hard and scope babes, but mainly hangs around the parking lot at Applebee's."
Popularity and reception.
Vice Media reported that da share z0ne had accumulated almost 88,000 followers on Twitter by January 2018. The account hit 100,000 followers in June 2018. According to Hathaway, da share z0ne has a "universal appeal" that "crosses cliquish social boundaries," as its memes are "retweeted by everyone from Weird Twitter chuckleboys to cool, queer, indie gamers to dry and boring media-marketing types." Jacob Brogan of "Slate" quoted and agreed with Hathaway's assessment of the account's "universal appeal," praising the persona of the account for "gently making light of the way we all present ourselves on social media—of the way we attempt to show off the best, brightest versions of our lives, only to accidentally reveal just how lame we really are." Luke O'Neil at "Dazed" praised the sharpness of da share z0ne's satire, as well as its surprising emotional depth and warmth:
Will Menaker, a cohost on the political comedy podcast "Chapo Trap House", made a tongue-in-cheek call for da share z0ne to receive the MacArthur "Genius Grant" in June 2016. "Mic" named a post from da share z0ne as one of 101 "canonical" tweets. In October 2017, Jerry Saltz–senior art critic for "New York" magazine—replied to a post by da share z0ne to call the account "Very late Francis Bacon?" In December 2017, Alex Greenberger of "ARTnews" included da share z0ne in a round-up of the year's best art on screens—including onscreen art installations at galleries and museums, cinema, television, and art "on my laptop"—saying "[i]t's art if I say it is—and da share z0ne is art." Da share z0ne was nominated in the "weird" category for the 10th Shorty Awards, an annual awards show by Sawhorse Media that recognizes exceptional short-form content on the social web, but it did not place as a finalist.
Da Share Z0ne was named one of "The 100 best, worst, and weirdest things we saw on the internet in the 2010s" in 2019 by the AV Club.
"The Devil's Level" card game.
"The Devil's Level" is a trading card game based on da share z0ne. Funded via Kickstarter, "The Devil's Level" reached its initial fundraising goal of $28,000 within hours of its launch on January 22, 2018. By the campaign's conclusion a month later, the game had reached $227,250 in funding. It is expected to ship in September 2018.
"The Devil's Level" features a core deck of 144 cards, plus three 36-card expansion packs, with cards encased in a foil-embossed skull box designed by Oliver Leach. The game's rules have been compared to "" and "Cards Against Humanity".

7 dní a 7 nocí

7 dní a 7 nocí (aka Sedm dní a sedm nocí; English: 7 Days and 7 Nights) is a 1994 Czech adventure game released on MS-DOS through Petr Vochozka's Vochozka Trading brand, and published by Pterodon Software. It was the first Czech video game to use Sound Blaster.
Gameplay and plot.
This is an erotic comedy inspired by the Leisure Suit Larry series. Jarek Kolář addressed the connections between his game and Leisure Suit Larry by asserting that while Larry acts like an unsuccessful sexual loudmouth, Venca is a self-confident village idiot. 
The main character, Venca Záhyb must look after millionaire Jonathan Smiht's 7 daughters and protect them from potential suitors. However, when he is sitting in a local pub with Fanda Kořen that evening, he bets one "lubr" that he will get all 7 daughters to the last. So Venca has one day for each girl and always has to overcome certain obstacles to win her heart. For example, in the case of Hermína Smihtová, the biggest obstacle is her homosexuality, in the case of Filoména Smihtová, her appearance, etc.
Development.
Creation.
Originally, the developers had planned to follow "Tajemství Oslího ostrova" (The Secret of the Donkey Island) with an adventure/RPG set at the time of the colonization of Latin America in the vein of the "Quest for Glory" series. However the project was shelved when Vochozka requested a game with ready-made graphics. The team built an adventure game editor with ready-made graphics and agreed to switch over projects, and they worked on the project while attending school.
Release.
Pterodon completed the PC version in just six months. The game is in 320x200 resolution and contains about 50 locations. It was released in November 1994, the same year as "Tajemství Oslího ostrova", and became the first Czech adventure video game to play digital music and sounds through Sound Blaster. One popular highlight of the game was an erotic action scene that saw the player press the two mouse buttons alternately to have protagonist Venca Záhyb make the daughters of Mr. Smiht reach climax. According to Petr Ticháček of Games.cz, "I will not even tell you how many mice I have destroyed" playing "7 dní a 7 nocí". However, Petr Vochozka later said, that the most important thing was to keep the rhythm of clicking, the speed was not so important. Later, the game was released as freeware.

Sarah Frey

Sarah Frey (born July 24, 1976) is an American farmer and entrepreneur. She is the CEO and owner of Frey Farms, which she founded at age sixteen. Frey Farms is the largest H-2A visa employer in Illinois as well as the largest grower of pumpkins in the United States.
Early life and education.
Frey was born July 24, 1976, to Harold and Elizabeth Frey. Both had been previously married. Her father was a steelworker and a farmer and for a time part owner of the Dixie Feed franchise in St. Louis, but her parents fled to Tennessee to escape what Frey calls "a perfect storm" of bad decision-making by her father, who staged an accident to make it look as if he'd died. The couple's first child, a girl, was killed as a toddler in a farm accident; the couple left Tennessee for Illinois shortly thereafter. Frey has four older full brothers, thirteen half-siblings from her father's first marriage, and two from her mother's first marriage; counting her half siblings she is the youngest of 21.
The family's original 80-acre farm, which they called the Hill, is five miles from Orchardville and thirty miles from Mount Vernon in southern Illinois. The family's home did not have indoor plumbing until Frey was five years old. It was heated by a woodstove. The family survived mostly on food raised on the farm or hunted and fished for, sometimes resorting to poaching. Frey wrote in her memoir, "The Growing Season", that "I never remember going to bed without eating anything, but sometimes our meals were just a bowl of mush."
In her memoir she describes learning to drive by the age of five, writing, "There were vehicles everywhere with the keys in the ignition. Starting when I was four or five, whenever my parents took the truck into town and left me alone at the farm, I'd hop into their old two-door Mercury Grand Marquis. I would hot-lap around the farm, driving in circles".
In her memoir Frey wrote that at age seven she was sexually abused by a farmhand, and when she told her father, he told her mother to keep a closer eye on Frey. She wrote that only after she'd discovered a peephole the farmhand had drilled between her bedroom and his and showed it to her mother did her parents send him away.
Her mother had a "melon route", purchasing melons from neighboring farms and delivering them to local grocery stores, which Frey helped with from the time she was 8.
At 15, she moved out of her parents' house.
Frey attended Frontier Community College while also attending high school.
Career.
At 16, she borrowed $10,000 to buy a used truck and took over distribution of the melon route, quickly increasing the farm's client list from 12 to 150.
Her parents' financial situation had become dire. Her parents, who had falsely presented themselves as married for thirty year, were separating. The farm was being foreclosed on. In her youth, Frey had wanted to follow her brothers off the farm and move to a city, but following the threat of the farm's repossession, she decided to help save it. She purchased the farm outright at age 18. At the time it was in two parcels, the original 80 acres and another parcel of 20. She decided to use the land to grow pumpkins, a fall crop that would be ready for harvest after the melon season ended and thereby extend her earnings period. She worked at the local Walmart distribution center business in 1997, while still in high school.
Frey has been described as "the Pumpkin Queen of America". She grows more pumpkins than any other farmer in the United States. In 2016, Frey sold around five million pumpkins. Most of her pumpkin crop is not suitable for eating, but is very popular for Halloween lantern carving. The family business now owns about of farms, spanning Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, and West Virginia. Although pumpkins are the most popular produce, the business also farms watermelons, cantaloupes, sweet corn, and hard squash. In 2018, Frey Farms launched Sarah’s Homegrown. Sarah’s Homegrown is focused on agua frescas and fresh produce. Frey Farms is a Certified Women Owned Business.
She created Tsamma Watermelon Juice as a way to use the "ugly fruit" that would otherwise be discarded or tilled back into the fields. Frey's business negotiations with Walmart have been featured in a Harvard Business School study.
Sarah Frey serves on the United Fresh Government Relations Council and the National Watermelon Promotion Board. She is also a member of the Illinois Agriculture Coalition committee. Frey is currently on the steering committee for the IBIC.
Her second book, "The Growing Season" (2020), was reviewed by "Publishers Weekly" and the "Boston Globe, The New York Times, Kirkus Reviews and The Library Journal".
Political Ambitions.
In 2019, Frey was recruited by congressional Republicans looking for a female candidate to replace Republican Representative John Shimkus after he announced his retirement but decided not to run.
Reception.
The "Boston Globe" called her "a woman with a potent sense of self and an unmatched ability for inventing and selling herself in a business world often skeptical of or hostile to women, especially those without pedigree or connections."
Personal life.
Frey is divorced with two sons.

Sundial, Taganrog

The Sundial () in Taganrog was set in 1833. It is situated in Grecheskaya Street, close to the Depaldo Stairs. It is officially declared an object of cultural heritage of Russia of Regional significance.
History.
The Sundial was installed in 1833 under the 6th Governor of Taganrog, Baron Otto Germanovich Frank. In 1972, in 1990, and in 2006―2007 the sundial was redecorated, the gnomon was replaced several times and so now the sundial works somewhat inaccurately. Taganrog Sundial is now the oldest currently existing sundial in Russia.
Description.
The dial of the Sundial is unusual: figures engraved on it were calculated according to a special formula, in addition to the notatification of a day hour, some corrections are given for each month of the year. Gnomon, the time indicator, is a metal triangle with a notch, and one of the sharp angles of it is equal to the geographical latitude of Taganrog ― 47 ° 12 'N. The gnomon is fixed perpendicular to the dial so that its hypotenuse is directed to the pole of the Earth. The clock's arrow is the edge of the shadow cast by the gnomon of the dial. In the Northern Hemisphere (where Taganrog is situated) at noon, this shadow is directed to the north. The clock does not take into account the transition from winter to summer time and vice versa. Earlier the Taganrog Sundial showed the right local solar time (which for Taganrog was 25 minutes earlier than Moscow time), and with the help of the corrections given to the dial, this time could be brought into line with the mechanical clock. As a result of several restorations, this accuracy has now been lost.
In 2000, before the central entrance to the Taganrog Gorky Park, a new sundial was installed. Unlike the sundial at the Depaldo Stairs, the new one casts a shadow at the plate, set at an angle of 47 ° 12 '(the latitude of Taganrog) to the horizon. This made it possible to make the time scale of the time scale even, and also made it possible to count the time in winter and summer according to the additional scale. The error in counting on these clocks is less than 1 minute.

Typhoon Robyn (1993)

Typhoon Robyn, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Openg, was a mid-season tropical cyclone that brushed Japan during August 1993. Typhoon Robyn originated from a near equatorial monsoon trough in the eastern Caroline Islands in late July. Tracking west-northwest, a tropical depression developed on August 1, and became a tropical storm the next day. Following an increase in organization, Robyn obtained typhoon intensity on August 5. The typhoon briefly tracked west before veering to the northwest while intensifying. On August 7, Robyn attained its peak intensity of 160 km/h (100 mph), with a barometric pressure of 940 mbar (27.8 inHg). After passing through the Ryukyu Islands, Robyn skirted past western Kyushu on August 9 while steadily weakening. Midday on August 10, Robyn lost typhoon intensity over the Sea of Japan. The next day, the system was declared an extratropical cyclone.
In advance of the storm, 5,300 individuals were evacuated from Nagasaki Prefecture. Around 100 flights in and out of Kagoshima Airport were called off. Throughout Japan, nine people were killed, and fifty others were wounded. A total of 564 structures were destroyed, 80 homes were damaged, 220 houses were flooded, roads were cut in 15 locations, and two dikes were ruined. On the island of Kyushu, over 10,000 people fled their homes and around 285,000 households lost electricity. Damage in the country totaled ¥10.3 billion, equal to US$92.3 million. In South Korea, 45 people were killed and damage was estimated at US$86 million. The remnants of the storm also dropped rainfall across the Russian Far East.
Meteorological history.
The sixth and final tropical cyclone of July, Robyn originated from a near equatorial monsoon trough in the eastern Caroline Islands. At 06:00 UTC on July 30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching the system as thunderstorm activity had persisted as the disturbance tracked west-northwest. On the afternoon on July 31, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued, following reports from Hurricane Hunters that a low-level center was forming. At 06:00 UTC on August 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Based on Dvorak classifications of T1.5/, the JTWC followed suit several hours later. Both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Robyn at 06:00 UTC on August 2, with the JTWC citing Dvorak estimates of T2.5/ as the reason for the upgrade. At the time of the upgrade, Robyn was located northwest of Chuuk.
Initially, Tropical Storm Robyn meandered erratically within a mesoscale convective system. At noon on August 3, the JMA upgraded Robyn into a severe tropical storm. Banding features increased in coverage that afternoon as the storm itself slowed down. Early on August 4, the JTWC estimated that Robyn attained typhoon intensity, although operationally, this was believed to have occurred 12 hours earlier, when Dvorak intensity estimates supported an intensity of . Robyn then began to cease all westward movement and instead took a dive south, only to turn north and later northwest. According to the JMA, Robyn leveled off in intensity for 30 hours, and did not become a typhoon until noon on August 5. Early on August 6, data from the JTWC suggested that Robyn entered a period of rapid deepening over 36 hours, ending winds of . The JMA disagrees, noting that only slight intensification occurred during this period. On August 7, the JMA estimated that Robyn attained its peak intensity of , with a barometric pressure of . Starting late on August 7, the JTWC estimated that Robyn began a weakening trend, although according to the JMA, Robyn maintained its intensity through August 8, with its pressure further dropping to After passing through the Ryukyu Island, Robyn skirted past western Kyushu on August 9 while steadily weakening. Midday on August 10, both the JTWC and JMA agreed that Robyn lost typhoon intensity over the Sea of Japan. The next day, both the JTWC and JMA classified the system as an extratropical cyclone.

Aulus Petronius Lurco was a Roman senator, who was active during the Principate. He was suffect consul in the "nundinium" for the second half of the year 58 AD with Aulus Paconius Sabinus as his colleague. He is known entirely from inscriptions.
It is known that Lurco was one of the Arval Brethren. A "M. Petronius Lurco" is mentioned as one of the three "curatores tabulariorum publicorum", along with Gaius Calpetanus Rantius Sedatus and Titus Satrius Decianus; this Petronius Lurco may be a brother of the consul of 58. Yet because the inscription that attests to this is known from a transcription in the "Einsiedeln Itinerary", which has errors, it is also possible the initial should be an "A." and Petronius Lurco is identical to the consul.

Dračí Historie

Dračí historie (English: Dragon History) is a 1995 DOS-based adventure game developed in the Czech Republic by NoSense. It was the first-ever Czech game to include dubbing and released on CD. The game was last updated in 2006. The dubbing was also translated into Polish and subtitles were translated into English and German.
Production.
Conception and design.
Early development commenced in 1994, by a group called NoSense, consisting of students at Masaryk University, in Brno, Czech Republic. The team consisted of programmers Pavel Pospíšil, Lukáš Svoboda and Robert Špalek; graphic artists Jakub Dvorský, Pavel Jura and Jan Pokorný; and musician Radovan Kramář. These students knew members of the small development team Pterodon, which had been responsible for "Tajemství Oslího ostrova", a noted success at the time. Hoping to outdo the Pterodon team, the team grew and eventually consisted of seven people. During 1994 and early 1995, NoSense focused on finding artists and writing a story. Active development began in mid-1995. The game was designed to be a grotesque adventure with unbridled jokes, and contained forty locations.
Release and aftermath.
Published in Christmas 1995, the game sold 7000 copies, becoming one of the best selling Czech games. In addition, it was the first-ever title to be released in the Czech Republic on CD. The CD version was the first Czech game to include amateur Czech dubbing, a breakthrough for the Czech game industry. 11 years later, the game was made available under the GPL License and was free to download after this point.
NoSense followed the game with 1997's "", which was worked on by Jakub Dvorský, who had also contributed to "Dračí historie" and later founded the Czech development company Amanita Design.
11 years after the game's original release in 2006, the game was revised for the first time, when Roberta Špalka cleaned it up ready for a remastered version which was released as freeware. In the summer of 2009, Denis Kasak completed an initial port of the game into C++ as part of the ScummVM project, during Google Summer of Code'09 (with Špalek as the mentor). The port was then completed by Špalek. In 2010 he cleaned the game scripts and graphics in order to make it easier to translate to other languages, while the English, German, and Polish versions were refined.
Plot and gameplay.
The game centres around a teen dragon named Bert. He lives with his father Herbert and mother Berta. Bert's father leaves to look for treasure. In his absence, Bert befriends the evil magic wand Evelyn. His father did not return for a long time, and the wand also disappeared. Therefore Bert decides to find them.
Critical reception.
The game received mostly positive reviews from critics in 1995. The lowest rating was 60% from Score, while the highest was 92% from Riki.
A review on Freegame.cz written in 2006 commented that the technical processing still held up. Tiscali.cz said that while the game was disappointing, it was nevertheless a turning point for the Czech game scene. Gry Online felt the game was humorous and targeted at children. Database-her.cz thought the title had pleasant cartoon graphics and humorous dialogues. In 2006, Bonusweb gave the game a rating of 80%, commenting that it had lost virtually nothing of its attractiveness. FreeHry.cz described it as a "true nostalgic memory of old good adventures". In 2010, Root.cz deemed it a blast from the past, yet still fun to play.
The game sold 7,000 copies in 1995, one of the best-selling Czech games at the time. Between 1995–1999, approximately 10 to 15 thousand official copies were sold.

Světák Bob

Světák Bob is a 1993 Czech adventure game developed by Bohewia and published by Petr Vochozka for the Amiga system.
Production.
The game was programmed for the Amiga by a pre-18 Petr Vochozka. After buying his own Atari 800 XL he began programming his own games that ended up in his desk drawer. A year after the Velvet Revolution, Vochozka replaced his Atari with the Amiga, and created his first game intended for public release, Svetak Bob. As he was younger than 18, distribution of the game was illegal as he did not have a trade license.
Petr Vochozka marketed "Světák Bob" as the first ever Czech commercial adventure for the Amiga. It was priced at 129 crowns and sold around 100 to 200 copies. This compares with Vochozka's follow-up "Tajemství Oslího ostrova" which sold 2,000 copies.
"Světák Bob" was the first officially distributed Czech computer game for the Amiga, and arguably on any platform.
According to the reviewer "Tomáš Smolík" in Excalubur, the game was programmed in the "Amos Professional Kit."
Prague Post notes that this achievement was a part of a wave of post-Soviet Union advances that saw the Czech video gaming industry quickly became more professional.
In the 21st century the game gained a considerable cult following.
Bonusweb notes that in 1994 it was still possible for a developer to review their own game, noting that Vochozka did this for Svetak Bob in the magazine Excalibur. In an interview with Vochozka, Bonusweb wrote: ""No, I definitely didn't write it myself, but I worked a little bit on it," he says with a smile. ""Moreover, there was a different time at that time, it wasn't a big deal if the Světák sold eighty pieces instead of forty ..."."
Plot and gameplay.
The main hero, Bob, collapses after a fierce storm and finds himself on a desert island. He has to get off the island and continue his adventure.
A hybrid between the text and classic point &amp; click adventure, the game offers similar gameplay to text-based games, but includes graphics and music. The game is mouse-controlled.
Critical reception.
According to Bonusweb.cz, the game's graphics were just a little better than horrible. BRNO Region asserts that the game was not a true global success. Vochozka later said the game wasn't "worldly". Amiga Review unfavourably compared it to Testament. At the time Exaclibur didn't give Czech games a rating to avoid discouraging local developers. Som Hrac argues the game was "quite a good success". Mafia felt the game was a "great success " that opened the door for other Czech games.
SME notes that this post-Iron Curtain era of gaming is marked by a national technological backwardness that had a flow-on effect to "scant technological and artistic abilities of potential game developers", adding that while good ideas were a dime a dozen, it was difficult to find top wuality graphics in local games.

2019 Australia national soccer team season

This page summarises the Australia men's national soccer team fixtures and results in 2019.
Summary.
Australia participated as title-holders in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup held in United Arab Emirates in January. The draw took place in Dubai on 4 May 2018. Australia qualified for the tournament after topping the group in the second round of the World Cup qualification campaign. Australia was hit by injuries ahead of the Cup with upcoming teenager Daniel Arzani and starting midfielder Aaron Mooy injured before the cup, and recently-debuted Scot-born Martin Boyle being injured in the final friendly match against Oman before the cup.
Australia's Asian Cup title defence commenced against Jordan and despite a pretence of favouritism due to being defending champions, Australia lost 1–0 after a headed goal from Jordan's Anas Bani Yaseen in the 26th minute. In their second match of the group, Australia bounced back from the loss, beating Palestine 3–0, with Jamie Maclaren scoring his first goal for Australia and Awer Mabil and Apostolos Giannou scoring too. Australia advanced from the group stage after beating Syria 3–2, with Tom Rogic scoring in injury time, following goals by Mabil and Chris Ikonomidis which put Australia in the lead. After the first two Australian goals, Syria equalized with goals by Omar Kharbin and Omar Al Somah. In the round of 16 match against Uzbekistan, neither team scored after 90 minutes of regulation time and after 30 minutes of extra-time. In the penalty shootout following the game, Australia progressed with a 4–2 score, after Mathew Ryan saved 2 penalties. In the quarter-final match against hosts United Arab Emirates, Australia were knocked-out of the Asian Cup after losing 1–0 with Ali Mabkhout scoring following a defensive error by Milos Degenek.
On 7 June 2019, Australia played an inexperienced side against South Korea in a friendly match in Busan. South Korea won 1–0 with Hwang Ui-jo scoring the only goal in the 76th minute. Australia had 4 players debuting for the senior national team, with Andrew Redmayne and Brandon O'Neill starting while Brandon Borrello and Ryan Williams were substituted on.
In September 2019, Australia commenced the qualification process for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Australia started in the second round of AFC qualification which doubles as the second round of qualifiers for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. The draw for the second round was held on 17 July 2019 at AFC House in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Australia were placed in pot 1 and were drawn against Jordan, Kuwait, Chinese Taipei and Nepal. Australia started the qualification process with a 3–0 away win over Kuwait, with stand-in skipper Mathew Leckie scoring a brace and Mooy scoring the third goal. A month later, in their first home match of the qualification process, Australia beat Nepal 5–0, with Maclaren scoring a hat-trick and Scottish-born debutant Harry Souttar scoring a brace. 5 days later, Australia travelled to Taiwan and beat Chinese Taipei 7–1, with Adam Taggart, and Jackson Irvine scoring braces while Souttar and Maclaren scored their fourth international goals in a week.
Australia finished the year in Jordan, where they had not previously beaten the hosts. An early Adam Taggart goal was the only one of the match to leave Australia with a perfect record after 4 matches of World Cup qualifying and 4 to play in the first half of 2020.

Aegis Defenders

Aegis Defenders is a 2D platforming and tower defense game developed by Guts Department. The game originated as a project for USC’s Intermediate Games class and had a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014. It was later picked up by publisher Humble Bundle in 2017 with Japanese publishing support from Kakehashi Games. "Aegis Defenders" was released on February 8, 2018, on macOS, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.
Gameplay.
In "Aegis Defenders", players control a team of up to 4 characters. In addition to running, jumping, and attacking, each character has a unique sub-ability and can build a unique item. Players can use "cross fusion" to combine items into more powerful ones.
Each level is usually split into exploration and tower defense phases. The exploration phase consists of platforming and puzzle solving. During the tower defense phase, players must protect their base (an important person or object) from waves of approaching enemies. There are 18 levels in the story campaign plus 3 bonus levels featuring crossover characters from other Kickstarter games including Shovel Knight, Lunais from Timespinner, and Derpl Zork from Awesomenauts.
Plot.
"Aegis Defenders" follows a pair of Ruinhunters, Bart and his grand daughter Clu, as they discover a powerful weapon known as Aegis and embark on a quest to prevent it from falling into the hands of an evil empire. Along the way they join forces with Kobo the companion drone, Kaiim the monk, and Zula the bandit.
Development and release.
"Aegis Defenders" originated as a student project by Bryce Kho and Lifu Lin for USC’s Intermediate Games class. After graduating, Bryce started indie studio Guts Department to develop the project into a full game and launched a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014.
The game was primarily developed by a 3-person team with Bryce Kho as director/writer/artist/designer, his sister Kristen Kho as engineer, and Max Palazzo as producer. Bryce's wife, Lai Xu, co-wrote the script. Max Palazzo and Mike Effenberger assisted Bryce with design and tuning for levels.
Guts Department partnered with Power Up Audio for the music and sound effects. The soundtrack was composed by Riley Koenig. It features 14 original tracks that blend together old-school synth elements with more traditional Japanese RPG orchestral music.
The game was demoed at several conventions including PAX West 2017 Indie Megabooth, Tokyo Game Show 2017, Gamescom 2017, PlayStation Experience 2017, and SXSW 2018. "Aegis Defenders" released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows and macOS on February 8, 2018.
Reception.
"Destructoid"s Chris Carter said "Aegis Defenders is a smooth, well-thought-out ride. The original art, charm, and in-game universe only add to it, and I'd love to see more." The game received a Gold Award in the Famitsu cross review, issue 1525 (February 2018), and was nominated for the 2018 SXSW Gamer's Voice Award. It received the "Best of the Mix" award at the E3 Week Mix 2017.

Maud O'Farrell Swartz

Maud O'Farrell Swartz (1879-1937) was an Irish-American labor organizer who worked to improve the lives of women and children. She served as president of the Women's Trade Union League from 1922 to 1926. In 1931 she was appointed secretary of the New York State Department of Labor under Industrial Commissioner Frances Perkins. She was the first woman and the first trade unionist to hold that position.
Early life and education.
Maud O'Farrell was born in County Kildare, Ireland, on May 3, 1879. She was one of fourteen children of William J. Farrell, a flour miller, and Sara Matilda Grace. Her mother was related to William Russell Grace, who became New York City's first Irish Catholic mayor in 1880, and to the owners of the Grace shipping line. Maud O'Farrell was educated at home, and then at convent schools in Germany and France. Afterwards she worked for a time as a governess in Italy. While living in Europe she became fluent in Italian, German, and French.
Career.
She moved to the United States in 1901, settling in New York City. She worked briefly as a governess, quitting after receiving unwanted attention from her employer. The following year she began working as a proofreader for a foreign language printing company, and in 1903 she joined the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL). 
In 1912 she joined the Woman Suffrage Party. A fluent Italian speaker, she canvassed Italian neighborhoods promoting women's suffrage to the women there.
She joined International Typographical Union Local 6, known as "Big Six," in 1913. She served as secretary of the New York WTUL from 1917 to 1921. She was a WTUL delegate to the American Federation of Labor convention in 1919 and the First International Congress of Working Women (ICWW) the same year. At the ICWW, she and other delegates drew up resolutions demanding an age minimum for working children, a 44-hour work week, and regulations for dangerous jobs. In 1921 she traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, as a delegate to the Second International Congress of Working Women. There she was named vice president of the newly founded International Federation of Working Women. Over the next two years she helped organize a global network of working women's groups.
After a year-long hiatus in Europe, she returned to New York in 1922 and began working for the WTUL as an advisor for women seeking workers' compensation. She was elected president of the national WTUL that same year, and re-elected in 1924. She was the first working woman to serve as WTUL president. At the same time, she worked as an adviser to the league's Compensation Service, handling some 4,000 cases between 1922 and 1929. Serving as president while working full time became burdensome, and she resigned the presidency in 1926. 
In December 1931, Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed her secretary of the New York State Department of Labor, a position she held until her death in 1937. The first woman and the first labor representative to hold that office, she served under Commissioners Frances Perkins and Elmer F. Andrews.
Swartz was known as a gifted speaker and a champion of better working conditions for women.
Personal life.
She married a printer named Lee Swartz in 1905. It was a brief, unhappy marriage, and the couple soon separated, declining to divorce for religious reasons. In 1912 she met Rose Schneiderman, with whom she had a close friendship until her death. In the 1920s, she and Schneiderman befriended Eleanor Roosevelt, who had joined the WTUL They often visited the Roosevelts and discussed labor problems.
She died of a heart attack on February 22, 1937, at the New York Hospital in Manhattan, and was buried in St. John's Cemetery in Brooklyn. Frances Perkins and Eleanor Roosevelt were among those who attended her funeral.

Montreux 82

Montreux 82 is a live album by saxophonist Charles Lloyd recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982 and released on the Elektra/Musician label the following year.
Reception.
Allmusic's Scott Yanow said: "Charles Lloyd came out of isolation and retirement in 1982 due to the persuasion of the then-unknown pianist Michel Petrucciani. As can be heard on this concert LP from the 1982 Montreux Jazz Festival, Lloyd's styles and sounds on tenor and flute were unchanged from his glory days in the 1960s ... excellent music".

Decres Bay

Decres Bay is a sheltered natural harbor south-east of Ceduna in South Australia. It was used for the export of wheat via transshipping prior to 1914. As of 2018 it features a camping site and is being reconsidered as the site of a potential future port.
Port Proposals.
In 1914, Decres Bay was under consideration as an alternative site for the development of a commercial port for the bulk handling of wheat at the terminus of the Minnipa Hill railway. The site was passed over, with insufficient depth of water at the entrance channel cited as a deciding factor. The channel offered a minimum depth of 8.2 metres (27 feet). Despite being more exposed to storms and swell, and requiring ongoing dredging works, the neighboring site at Cape Thevenard was selected in preference. Members of the Murat Bay Vigilance Committee believed that the port proposal was abandoned as a result of prejudice and politics; namely that the two sites represented competing visions of consecutive Labor (Decres Bay) and Liberal (Thevenard) governments. The proposed jetty was to be 1260 feet (384 metres) long and reach into water 30 feet deep (9.1 metres) but was never built.
In February 2018, Decres Bay was named as a site for a prospective new "stand-alone" port.

Siphesihle Ndlovu

Siphesihle Ndlovu (born 30 September 1996) is a South African professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier Soccer League side Orlando Pirates and the South Africa national team. An academy graduate of Maritzburg United, he made his professional debut in 2016 and went on to make over 80 appearances for the club. During the 2017–18 season, he helped the club to record-high fourth-place finish in the league and was rewarded for his form with the Young Player of the Season award. At the end of the following season, he joined Orlando Pirates.
Ndlovu is also a full international since March 2018 and has represented South Africa at a COSAFA Cup.
Club career.
Maritzburg United.
Having previously been a ball-boy for the club, Ndlovu joined the youth academy of Maritzburg United from the now defunct Umgungundlovu Academy of Sport in Pietermaritzburg. He excelled during his time in the club's academy where he played in the SAB League and earned the nickname Mbesuma, in reference to former PSL top goalscorer, Collins Mbesuma. In 2016, he was promoted to senior side by coach Roger De Sa alongside Mlondi Dlamini and Tso Motjatji. He made his debut for the club on 22 October 2016 when he came on as a substitute for Denis Weidlich in a penalty shootout loss to Kaizer Chiefs in the Nedbank Cup. His league debut followed on 20 December in a 1–1 draw with Bidvest Wits and he went on to make 18 appearances across all competitions for the season.
Ndlovu enjoyed a stellar campaign under Fadlu Davids during the 2017–18 season in which he helped the club to an historic league finish. In January 2018, he became the first-ever player from Maritzburg United to win the Absa Premiership Player of the Month award and two months later was rewarded with a new long-term contract with the club, ending speculation linking him with a transfer away. He then made his 50th appearance for the club on 25 April when he started in a 2–2 draw with Mamelodi Sundowns. The following month, he featured in the Nedbank Cup final where Maritzburg United were defeated 1–0 by Free State Stars. The season culminated with Maritzburg United ending fourth in the league; their highest ever finish with their highest ever points tally. On 21 May, following a campaign in which he played in all but three matches, scored five goals and was the most fouled player in the league, Ndlovu was nominated for a host of PSL awards including the awards for Midfielder of the Season, Young Player of the Season and Footballer of the Season. He was also nominated for the Most Promising Player award for his performances in the Nedbank Cup. The award ceremony was held eight days later during which he walked away with the Midfielder of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards.
Ahead of the following season, Ndlovu reportedly agreed to a deal in principle to sign with Mamelodi Sundowns at the end of the campaign. He struggled for form during the first half of the season and picked up his first professional red card when he received a direct dismissal for a studs-up challenge on Kaizer Chiefs defender Siyabonga Ngezana in August. His struggles coincided with those of the Maritzburg United's who ended the domestic season second last in the league standings, having gone through three managers. As a result, the club was forced to take part in the promotion play-offs in which Ndlovu scored once to ensure they maintained their top-flight status.
Orlando Pirates.
On 12 June 2019, Ndlovu confirmed that he had signed a three-year deal with Orlando Pirates. Upon making the announcement, he informed media that he had never signed any agreement with Sundowns and that his reason for joining Pirates was that the club's style of play suited his abilities.
International career.
South Africa.
In March 2018, Ndlovu was called up to the South African national team for the first time by coach Stuart Baxter for the inaugural Four Nations Invitational Tournament. He made his debut on 21 March, coming on as a second-half substitute for Maphosa Modiba in a 1–1 (7–6) penalty shootout win over Angola. He made his first start three days later as South Africa beat hosts Zambia 2–0 to claim the title.
Later that year he was named in Baxter's squad for the 2018 COSAFA Cup. He started in South Africa's opening match in the competition, a penalty shootout loss to Madagascar. He featured throughout the tournament as South Africa went on to lift the Plate title, equivalent of a fifth-placed finish.

The Grade Cricketer

The Grade Cricketer is the pen name of three Australian cricket writers, Sam Perry, Dave Edwards and Ian Higgins. They were friends who played grade cricket in Australia and began a Twitter account as @gradecricketer. They subsequently wrote books and columns and host a podcast. In July 2020 it was announced Dave Edwards had left the group to focus on other commitments.
Podcast.
The Grade Cricketer Podcast is presented by the three creators of the persona during the Australian cricketing summer, and is a comedic, satirical take on the cricketing world. There have been four seasons since the promo episode was released in October 2016. Music is provided by Adrian Leung, with cover design by Julia Dowe.
Format.
Interviews.
At least one guest is usually interviewed in each episode, and the format regularly involves one interview with a cricket journalist, and a further one later on with a current or former player. These always begin with some form of the question "What's your relationship with Grade Cricket?"; whilst the player interviews end with throw-downs, in which the presenters ask ridiculous, long-winded questions, to which the guest can often respond only with a binary yes/no answer. The most frequent guests, also known as "best friends of the show", are Adam "Collo" Collins from the journalism world, with ten appearances, and Ed "Ted" Cowan from the players with six (also the first guest, having to re-record his interview after a technical mishap - this has now occurred twice).
AskTGC.
The last section of the podcast normally involves answering questions submitted to The Grade Cricketer via social media, (the Twitter hashtag being #askTGC, hence the name). These questions are often incredibly long, leading Higgins to sometimes refer to the section as their "short story competition", but also sometimes little more than a statement followed by "thoughts?", and regularly concern topics such as alpha-ing, father-son relationships, social status within clubs/teams, retirement from the game, and other general advice relating to the world of amateur cricket.
Advertisements.
Over the course of the podcast run, advertisements for various products, both real and imaginary tie-in ones, have been inserted, voiced by Toby Shain and, occasionally, the hosts themselves. Products include:
TV Show.
In 2018, The Grade Cricketer on 7 show was launched on 7Sport's YouTube channel. The season covered the 2018/19 summer of cricket and featured 11 episodes featuring all of the trio. In 2019, The Grade Cricketer on 7 was moved to 7plus for season 2 covering the 2019/20 summer of cricket, however season 2 was only presented by Ian Higgins and Sam Perry.
Live Shows.
The Grade Cricketer has presented live shows over multiple Australian Summers and the English Summer of 2019, during the 2019 World Cup and 2019 Ashes. The Live Shows like the podcasts also normally feature guests.
Terminology.
Many terms have been popularised through the books and podcast efforts of The Grade Cricketer. These include:

Heinrich August Matthaei

Heinrich August Matthaei (3 October 1781 – 4 November 1835) was a German violinist and composer. He was for many years concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Life.
Matthaei was born in Dresden in 1781. Little is known of his early life; it is thought he was largely self-taught as a violinist. In 1803 he arrived in Leipzig, and was appointed as a soloist of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, of which the concertmaster was Bartolomeo Campagnoli. Through patrons and friends he had the opportunity to study in Paris, where from 1804 he was a student of Rodolphe Kreutzer.
In 1806 he reappeared in public in Leipzig, and became important there in musical activities. With other members of the Gewandhaus Orchestra – Campagnoli, Johann Georg Hermann Voigt and Friedrich Dotzauer – he founded in 1808 a string quartet, the Gewandhaus Quartet. (The quartet still exists today.) In 1811 Matthaei performed in Berlin, and in 1816 he toured northwest Germany. In 1818 he replaced Campagnoli as concertmaster of the Gewandhaus Orchestra; he held the post until his death in 1835.
Carl Ferdinand Becker, in an obituary, wrote that he "through word and deed, guided many young musicians so excellently" and "revealed to us Beethoven's masterpieces". "The Leipzig orchestra was made famous by Matthaei... Beethoven himself bestowed praise on him."
Compositions.
His compositions include four violin concertos (op 2, 9, 15 and 20), Fantasy with Variations for violin and orchestra (op 8), and two string quartets (op 6 and 12).

Melinda Ballard

Melinda Ballard (1958–2013) was an activist for insurance policyholders in America. In 1999, she sued her insurer over mold damage in her 22-room family home in Dripping Springs, Texas. The family seemed to be living the perfect life when suddenly their 3-year-old son, Reese Allison, developed a respiratory condition in March 1999. Her husband Ron Allison, is later shown to have signs of Alzheimer's disease. On April 1, 1999 after the start of Ron and Reese‘s symptoms, Melinda takes a Southwest Airlines flight and becomes ill, coughing up blood. An air quality expert and investigator named Bill Holder who was sitting in the adjacent seat, asked if there was a leak in their home which she confirmed. He speculates that their ill health could be due to a toxic form of black mold in their 12,000 square foot home, which was based on the movie version of "Tara", the home of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. Their case started as a single claim for water damage and turned into a case about mold contamination in the entire house. They were one of the first cases to highlight the dangerous results of toxic mold and changed how normal indoor mold was viewed in America. 
She and her husband, Ron Allison, were awarded $32 million in 2001 as a result of a lawsuit against Farmers Insurance for mold damage. The award was later changed to $4 million. As a result of her case and the attention she received, Ballard founded Policyholders of America, a consumer advocate group and homeowner’s insurance information clearinghouse. In 2013, Ballard died at the age of 55.
Melinda died, following a lung transplant, which was necessitated by the existence of mold plugs growing in her lungs following her Mold Exposure. 
Ron died in 2020, never having regained his cognitive functioning following the Brain Encephalopathy caused by the Mold Toxins.
Reese died in February of 2021; of multiple Health issues, caused by his exposure to Mold Toxins, which had never resolved over his young life.
Treatment for mold exposure, which causes broad and lingering damage to the body, is still difficult to find in a cohesive Treatment Program.

Hunter Clark

Hunter Clark (born 26 March 1999) is a professional Australian rules footballer with the St Kilda Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He was drafted by St Kilda with their first selection and seventh overall in the 2017 national draft.
Early life.
Clark is from Mount Martha on the Mornington Peninsula and played junior football with the Mount Martha Football Club. As a boy, Clark was fascinated by jungle animals and wildlife. Clark attended Padua College with fellow footballer Tom De Koning.
AFL career.
Clark made his debut in the twenty-five point win against the at Etihad Stadium in the opening round of the 2018 season. In round 13 of the 2018 season, Clark was nominated for the AFL Rising Star after a 17-disposal performance in St Kilda's win against . He ultimately played 15 games in his debut season.
The 2019 season began quietly for Clark who was left out of the senior side for the first two rounds due to form. Clark played rounds three and four, before being dropped again for two games and making a return in round seven. Clark was dropped for rounds 8-12, but returned in round 13 and played every game until the end of the season. In the second half of the season, Clark had improved considerably and averaged 20 disposals, five marks and four intercepts a game. Two standout games came in round 17 against Geelong where he had 25 disposals and laid nine tackles, and round 18 against the Bulldogs where he had 26 disposals, three clearances and two goals.
In a Covid-interrupted 2020 season, Clark played largely across half-back but spent increased time in the midfield late in the season. He played 18 of a possible 19 matches for the year, including two finals. Clark was instrumental late in the game to help the Saints defeat the Suns by 4 points in round 10. Clark was one of the best players afield against the win over ladder leaders Port Adelaide in round eight, with a game-high 24 disposals and five rebounds . Clark was selected at half-back in the AFL's 22Under22, a fan-voted award where the AFL's best 22 players under the age of 22 are recognised annually. Clark also finished top three for his team in disposals in the regular season, as well as ground-ball-gets.
Clark had an injury-affected 2021 year, managing only 13 games from a possible 22. Clark suffered multiple jaw fractures in a round 13 game against Adelaide and required surgery to repair the damage. Clark returned in Round 20 to face Carlton, but suffered a concussion in that game. The concussion ultimately ruled Clark out for the remainder of the season. Despite the frustrating season, Clark had some standout performances, in particular a 33 disposal game against Richmond in Round five, and a 26 disosal two goal and six tackle performance against Hawthorn in Round seven.

Feelin Kinda Free

Feelin Kinda Free is the sixth studio album from Australian band The Drones, and their final one before going on hiatus. Having grown tired with the more rock-oriented sound of the band up until that point, frontman Gareth Liddiard became fascinated with both vintage and modern electronic equipment - ranging from drum machines and samplers to the Teenage Engineering OP-1 synthesizer - in conceiving the album's sound. Its genre-defying musical style has been described as visceral and ominous, featuring a relative absence of guitars and a prominent use of electronic textures. Its sessions also marked the first appearance of drummer Christian Strybosch since 2005's "Wait Long by the River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By".
Their shortest at just over 40 minutes, "Feelin Kinda Free" received fairly positive reviews for its eclectic sound and Liddiard's darker, more politically-charged lyricism. It also charted at #12 on the ARIA Charts - the band's highest till date. The album went on to appear on numerous year-end lists and would later be chosen by "Junkee" as one of the best Australian albums of the decade.
Background.
After the release of "I See Seaweed" in 2013, Drones founder Gareth Liddiard expressed his desire to step away from the more rock-centric style of previous Drones albums on their next project. "Before we moved to Melbourne back in the 90s," he said in an interview with "Musicfeeds", "we were a very weird sounding band. It was Melbourne that turned us more into a rock band, which kind of helped us to get gigs. This is a return to the way we were before in a way – getting drunk, getting stoned, noodling on anything you can find and making weird little songs."
The whole thing was to not have blues guitars in it [...] I’d been listening to really old four-track tapes from the '90s that me and [former The Drones member] Rui [Periera] made, and they’re all totally bizarre. It was almost as though having two guitars playing American-ish, country-ish, blues-ish guitars music – that was a stretch for us. We had to learn how to do that. But just being completely f-cking weird is so natural. It was a relief. Everyone was on [our] side, everyone was cool.
Recording.
The album, recorded in the band's studio in the Fitzroy North suburb of Melbourne, was mixed on the desk that was reportedly used by Nile Rodgers for Madonna's "Like a Virgin". It was mixed by Aaron Cupples, who had previously co-produced 2006's "Gala Mill" and would go on to mix Tropical Fuck Storm's debut "A Laughing Death in Meatspace". Drummer Christian Strybosch, who had previously drummed on the band's first two releases, performs on this album having replaced Mike Noga in 2014.
Liddiard described the genesis of the album's sonic experimentation as follows:We rented out this studio with a couple of mates. One of those mates, Phil, had stopped being interesting in buying vintage rock &amp; roll equipment. He moved over to buying hip-hop equipment – vintage stuff that acts like Public Enemy or Kool Keith would use. We had all that shit laying around for the first time in our life – synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, stuff like that. He had an OP1, a very modern synth, and I became fascinated with that to the point where I bought my own.
Noting that recording the album had taken them an entire year, Strybosch expanded upon the album's recording process in an interview with "Tone Deaf":Rather than just bashing away at drums and guitars…this time we used more triggers and loops, synth, minimal guitars in places, mixed samples with live…sometimes it’s like working at a little space station. It was conscious in the way that we wanted it to sound different from other (The Drones) records, and I think we achieved that.
Despite this, a majority of the album's effects were, according to Liddiard, generated on guitar.
Content.
Style.
According to Liddiard: "It's a pretty weird record and you can dance to it...We're sick of being a bunch of drags." The album was described in its press release as "a bad trip you can dance to".
Critics have described the album as "menacing", "ominous" and "visceral". Mischa Pearlman of "Record Collector" considers it to be "weirder and more twisted than anything they’ve released before." Joe Whyte of "Louder Than War" noted the incorporation of "krautrock and even funk into the drums and bass although it’s no less unnerving than some of their earlier blizzards of guitar noise." Many critics noted the reduced presence of guitars on the album, with "The Guardian" writing: "The emphasis is mostly on bass and percussion: guitars are heavily treated; frequently, you’d be forgiven for thinking there are no guitars at all." The "greater variation and eclecticism" in the band's use of Fiona Kitschin's backing vocals (more prominently present on this album) have earned comparisons to that of CocoRosie. The music overall has earned comparisons to older Australian post-punk bands such as Pel Mel, Sardine v and Laughing Clowns, while "Mojo" likened it to a "Gibby Haynes-fronted Bongwater."
Songs.
The opener "Private Execution" "starts with a familiar cacophony of guitar noise" that "suggests Muse by way of King Crimson" and features "guttural bass lines". The song has been described as "industrial, Sigur Ros-ian post-rock", and the guitars during its ending climax earned comparisons to the "Sicilian strings" from "The Godfather" soundtrack. Its lyrics explore several themes, including violence in relation to human history, and references the Bali Nine. The following track "Taman Shud" (released as a single) mentions the infamous, unsolved 1948 murder case of the same name, and has been described as "at once a glorious celebration of the best qualities of Australiana and a vitriolic riposte to all that’s ill in the lucky country" Liddiard has described the song as a "big piss off [to those who] try to lay down the rules and the terms, tell you what you have to do to be Australian". The music has been described as "arrythmic", "stark", "jagged" and "simmer(ing) with atonal uneasiness". The lyrics to "Then They Came For Me" references the poem "First they came..." by Martin Niemöller and deals with the subject of immigration from the point of view of a refugee whilst the music has been described as "idiosyncratic" and "anti-anthemic". The song's "high-pitched, airy whistle" effect - mimicking the Jericho trumpets mentioned in its lyrics - was created entirely on guitar. "To Think That I Once Loved You" is "an achingly sad ballad that skilfully treads the line between gentle and unnerving without a misstep" that has been musically described as "icy, downtempo electronica".
The "claustrophobic" track "Tailwind" features ""Reflektor"-style minimal electronics" with lyrics that deal with obsolescence and irrelevance. Similar to "Then They Came For Me", the song's "singing saw sound" was created on guitar. "Boredom" has been described as being hip hop-influenced with lyrics that "(name-drop) welfare states and Islamic caliphates, prophecising the imminent death of the 'cradle of civilisation' – the Middle East" as well as "describing the drivers of young people joining terrorist organisations, specifically IS" from the perspective of a Muslim teenager living in the Western Suburbs (according to "The Monthly", the track is "partly told from the viewpoint of Jake Bilardi [...]"). The chorus on the track has been noted for being similar to "Boredom" by Buzzcocks. The song "Sometimes", featuring lead vocals from Fiona Kitschin, has been described as the "hypothetical missing link between Massive Attack and FKA Twigs", with lyrics that critique modern consumer culture. The closing track "Shut Down SETI" refers to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in its title and lyrically explores "human savagery from the perspective of an extra terrestrial outsider" as well as motivations of vanity and pride in the guise of "scientific curiosity" which is often used to justify such research. It has been musically described as ""Taman Shud"'s angrier, drunker older brother", with Liddiard and Kitschin's vocals contrasting to create a "two-pronged environment" that culminates in a "finale overture, as though drawing elements from every single prior track on the album." "Allmusic" noted that the track, "with its surrealistic ranting, sudden stylistic shifts, and white squalls of dissonance, wouldn't have sounded out of place on David Bowie's Blackstar." "OndaRock", on the other hand, compared the track to Tom Waits.
Release.
The album was released on 18 March 2016 through Tropical Fuck Storm Records. Videos for the tracks "Taman Shud", "Boredom" and "To Think That I Once Loved You" were made available on YouTube.
Artwork.
The cover features the unsolved code from the Tamam Shud case. It was "found written on a scrap of paper – which was ripped from a book found in a random man’s car footwell – which ended up in the pocket of an unidentified corpse on Somerton beach in Adelaide in 1948." Of the incident, Liddiard said: "It’s well known, [...] Everyone in America knows about the whole fucking thing, but no one in Australia is interested in anything Australia".
Controversy.
The single "Taman Shud" - the video for which was released in October 2015 - caused controversy for referencing conservative pundit Andrew Bolt in its lyric "I don’t care about no Andrew Bolt", who later responded by writing that "(the band was) stamping on the ashes of the west’s musical traditions" and that this is proof he was "offending exactly the right kind of people." In response, Liddiard said:For him it’s a pose: trashing inner-city lefties indie rock band, saying they’re fucked. He’s keeping up appearances for his fans. Trashing us was a really cynical move. Good on him. Thanks for that Andrew!

The album received a Metacritic score of 71 based on 7 reviews, implying a "generally favorable" critical reception.
"Drowned in Sound" called it "the best apocalypse soundtrack you’ll ever hear", while "The Guardian" called it "a menacing, avant-garde interrogation of Australia", going on to write that "sounds like the work of a less dour and far more subversive band." "Louder Than War" called it "a masterclass in genre-defying rock" in which "no prisoners are taken". According to "Record Collector", the album "covers so much ground – musically, thematically, philosophically, politically – that it’s like a lifetime of experiences swirling inside your head simultaneously" calling it "important" in "a modern world ever more tailored to undemanding audiences and reduced attention spans". Calling it the band's best work, Darío García Coto of Spanish magazine "Mondo Sonoro" praised the band for eschewing their older sound whilst still maintaining their "dirty and corrosive epic" style.
Allmusic was more reserved in its praise, writing that "(it's) certainly not an upbeat listen, nor are its myriad regional allusions easy to parse for non-Australians", despite calling it engaging "on a cerebral level that (is) consistently intoxicating, even at its most lethal." "Q" gave a more mixed review, calling the album "a mess, but [...] never less than an absorbing one."
Many sources have since recognized the album's sound as a precursor to Liddiard's and Kitschin's work in Tropical Fuck Storm.
Contemporary reception &amp; influence.
Comedians Tom Ballard and James Acaster included "Feelin Kinda Free" among their favourite albums of 2016. 
In 2020, Modest Mouse lead singer Isaac Brock named it one of his 9 favourite albums of all time. "I like them so much that they could actually show up to my house and just crap on me,” Brock said about the band &amp; the album, “I’ve never actually heard anyone do as good a job covering as much distance of what modern politics [sic] and the terror that awaits us in a way that doesn’t sound like political singing". He has also cited the lyric "What do fish know about water?" from the track "Private Execution" as an influence on the lyrics to Modest Mouse's 2021 album "The Golden Casket", calling it "a very simple, concise way of saying we don't know what we don't know and there's a lot we don't fucking know."
Covers &amp; remixes.
The song "Taman Shud" was covered by Laura Jean (who provides backing vocals on "To Think That I Once Loved You") both live and as a demo, the latter of which appeared on 2017's "Thirty Days of Yes" mixtape (featuring music from artists championing LGBT marriage equality in Australia).
On 16 March 2018, "Boredom Remixes" - a 12" EP featuring 4 remixes of the track "Boredom" from Kim Moyes (as K.I.M. and Zero Percent) - was released by his label Here To Hell Records (making it the label's first release). The EP was also made available on Bandcamp.

Messenger of the Gods

Messenger of the Gods (aka Posel bohů) is a 1998 Czech adventure game developed and published by Future Games. It would be remade in the 2005 as , released by Future Games.
Production.
The game began to be developed in 1996 by two graphic designers and one programmer who met at school: Pavel Pekárka, Michal Pekárka, and Jan Hilgard. The musician Zdeněk Houb was added to the team as co-author of the screenplay. Work on the game initially took place at home on older PCs. Unlike other Czech adventures of the period, this one did not have a humorous element. In addition, the game was notable for having the player see the action through the player's eyes like in , rather than a third-person view. The developers sought inspiration from the LucasArts' series of Indiana Jones games.
The game was premiered at the 1998 Invex, and entered into the JRC distribution network.
It became one of the most successful Czech games.
Plot and gameplay.
The player is archaeological expert Stanislav Novotny, who is on a mission to discover a Mayan mystery.
The game contains many logical-themed puzzles. It contains 100 game screens, VGA graphics, professionally dubbed dialogue, and 50 scenic tracks.
Reception.
This game was overlooked in many of the local gaming magazines such as Score and Excalibur. It sold over 1,500 units in the Czech Republic, which Future Games called "relatively enough for Czech conditions".
According to Petr Ticháček of Bonusweb.cz, the title is the largest and most difficult game he had ever played.

1917 Ceylonese Legislative Council election

The second election to the Legislative Council of Ceylon was held 20 January 1917.
Background.
In 1833 the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission created the Legislative Council of Ceylon, the first step in representative government in British Ceylon. Initially the Legislative Council consisted of 16 members: the British Governor, the five appointed members of the Executive Council of Ceylon, four other government officials and six appointed unofficial members (three Europeans, one Sinhalese, one Tamil and one Burgher).
In 1889 the number of appointed unofficial members was increased to eight (three Europeans, one Low Country Sinhalese, one Kandyan Sinhalese, one Tamil, one Muslim and one Burgher).
The Legislative Council was reformed in 1910 by the "McCallum Reforms". Membership was increased to 21 of which 11 were officially appointed and 10 were unofficial (two elected Europeans, one elected Burgher, one elected educated Ceylonese, two appointed Low Country Sinhalese, two appointed Tamils, one appointed Kandyan Sinhalese and one appointed Muslim). Less than 3,000 Ceylonese were eligible to vote for the four elected unofficial members.
Unofficial members.
The following were the elected unofficial members :

The Crooked Hearts

The Crooked Hearts is a 1972 American made-for-television comedy film starring Rosalind Russell, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and was directed by Jay Sandrich. The film marked Russell's final acting appearance and was originally broadcast as the "ABC Movie of the Week" on November 8, 1972.
Plot.
Lorita Dorsey is a widow trying to marry rich bachelor Rex Willoughby.
Production.
The film was shot over 12 days.
Reception.
The "New York Times" said it was "pleasant but wears exceedingly thin". The review concludes: "Some viewers probably would settle for outright comedy minus the clanky hanky‐panky, with Miss Russell simply being her rakish, lah‐de‐dah self. This lady's not for murder, she's for winks. And so, at this point, is Mr. Fairbanks, with his vintage courtliness. Miss O'Sullivan, looking like a million, Ross Martin, Michael Murphy and Kent Smith all do well in supporting roles, under Jay Sandrich's smooth direction of an equally smooth script by A. J. Russell. But better a short breeze than a long‐winded teaser."
The "Los Angeles Times" called it "outstanding". Judith Crist in "TV Guide" said, "1972's 'The Crooked Hearts' is a better-than-usual tailored-for-television flick, only because the performers--Rosalind Russell, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Maureen O'Sullivan--prove themselves old pors at charming their way through weak material as lonely-hearts racketeers."

Isola (comics)

Isola is an American ongoing fantasy comic series created by writer Brenden Fletcher and writer/artist Karl Kerschl, published by Image Comics. 
The series is set in a mystical land, where the queen’s brother enacts a treacherous plot to transform her into a tiger. The captain of the guard, a woman of great skill, brings swift and lethal vengeance, unaware the wicked prince alone has the power to reverse the spell. The two women—one on two legs, one on four—must undertake a perilous journey halfway across the globe to the fabled island of Isola, gateway to the underworld, where they hope to find the spirit of the queen’s late brother who has the power to return his sister to human form. 
Publication history.
"Isola" was first announced at the 2016 Image Expo. Writer Brendan Fletcher explained he and writer/artist Karl Kerschl had been working towards the comic since elementary school. The story follows two women, Queen Olwyn, and Rook, her captain of the guard, on a journey to the island of Isola in hopes of reversing a curse that transformed the queen into a tiger. Kerschl and Fletcher cite the films of Hayao Miyazaki as an influence on the tone of "Isola". Kerschl worked closely with colorist Michele Assarasakorn (MSassyK) to create a cinematic feel, mapping out colors in advance to reflect the characters’ journey.
The series was originally scheduled for launch in the spring of 2017, but was delayed until spring 2018. "Motor Crush", another Image Comics series also written by Fletcher, ran a five-part prologue to "Isola" as a back-up feature. The prologue is currently available to read on Karl Kerschl's website.
Reception.
Reception to the first issue was mostly positive. Jenna Anderson of Comicbook praised the world building and way "Isola"’s characters are defined through their actions. Molly Barnewitz of Comicsverse particularly praised Rook’s characterization. However, David Pepose of Newsarama felt the story was too decompressed and that its only selling point was Kerschl’s art. Karl Kerschl and MSassyK’s art received universal praise.
The Eisner-winning digital comics magazine "PanelxPanel" selected "Isola" as its feature comic for April 2018. This was particularly notable, since "PanelxPanel" normally selects comics with longer runs, specifically avoiding comics with only a single issue out. Editor Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou explained in his introduction that he had made an exception for "Isola" #1 since it is markedly different from most other first issues, specifically that it was “more contemplative and less expository, but deeply interesting and worthwhile.”

Adli Qudsi

Adli Qudsi (1940 – 2018) was an architect known for his efforts in the reconstruction and preservation of the ancient city of Aleppo, Syria. In the 1970s, he successfully halted an urban expansion project that would have widened the streets of the Old City. In the 1980s, his lobbying efforts succeeded in placing Old Aleppo on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. By 2008, Qudsi had dedicated decades of his life to the rehabilitation of the historic neighborhood and hoped it would be a "fruitful example" to other cities whose ancient quarters were at risk of decay.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Qudsi was born in Aleppo, Syria, in 1940, and spent the first 13 years of his life in a courtyard house in the Old City. Qudsi received his degree in Architecture from Washington State University in 1964 and lived in Seattle for 16 years.
Return to Aleppo and Early Activism.
In 1975, Qudsi returned to his hometown, where he found the municipal authorities had adopted a European-inspired Master Plan aiming to widen the roads in the Old City and cut through its fabric. Qudsi was determined to stop the bulldozers and, in 1978, after meeting with local officials and with the support of a group of concerned residents, he convinced the Cultural Minister to register Aleppo as a historic site, temporarily halting all renovations and demolitions. In 1978, officials from UNESCO visited Aleppo, and declared the city as a World Heritage Site in 1986. By 1990, all work demolishing the city came to a halt. In 1994, an emergency fund was created to fund his idea of interest-free loans for Aleppo's residents to restore their homes.
Old City Conservation Efforts.
After successfully halting the Master Plan, Qudsi dedicated the following decades of his life to the rehabilitation and preservation of the Old City of Aleppo. He founded Conception and Construction Consultants, a private architecture office which executed projects across the Old City, and was appointed the Aga Khan Trust for Culture representative in Syria in 1999.
In 1990, he launched the "Project for the Rehabilitation of the Old City of Aleppo" with the support of the German government (GiZ) and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development in Kuwait.
In 2007, he created the "Friends of the Citadel of Aleppo" foundation with the aim of supporting the administration, rehabilitation and maintenance of the Aleppo Citadel and its surroundings.
Recognition.
Qudsi was selected as an Associate Laureate for the Rolex Awards in 1998 in "Recognition of his struggle to preserve and rehabilitate the Old City of Aleppo."
Published works.
In 1995, he prepared a project paper entitled "Modernization of City Administration: Management, Urban and Environmental Planning" which became the basis of an active EU project to upgrade six major municipalities in Syria.
Death.
Qudsi died in a traffic accident in Mersin, Turkey on January 21, 2018.
Personal life.
Qudsi was married to Arij Shalab Al Sham and is survived by two daughters, Jwanah Qudsi and Laila Qudsi.

Andreas Suchanek

Andreas Suchanek (born August 12, 1961 in Stadthagen, Germany) is a German economy and business ethicist and one of the best-known students of Karl Homann, an expert in business ethics.
He is an economist as well as an expert in business and economy ethics. As academic disciple of Karl Homann he contributed substantially to Homanns teaching regarding the approach of institutional economics toward business ethics, which not only plays an important part at Universities and international business schools but also in the economy, politics and the society.
Life.
Andreas Suchanek studied political economy at the University Kiel and the University Göttingen before he graduated as doctor of political science summa cum laude from the private Witten/Herdecke University in 1993. In 1999 he was habilitated at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt due to his work on normative environmental economics. Subsequently, in 1999, he was appointed as Karl Homanns successor and took over the substitution of the chair for economy and business ethics at the University's science faculty. Homann left to serve as chair for philosophy and economy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 2004, Suchanek joined the HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management (former Handelshochschule Leipzig). Since that time, he holds the Dr. Werner Jackstädt-chair for economy and business ethics.
In addition to this, since 2005, Suchanek is as member of the Wittenberg-Center for Global Ethics (Wittenberg-Zentrums für Globale Ethik) board of directors which specializes on the topics "Building Global Cooperation" and corporate social responsibility as globalization, world economy and global competition are supposed to be shaped for the benefit of all people. According to the center, this requires general principles which make peace, justice and prosperity possible in the consolidating world society. Since 2013 Suchanek is the center's chairman and vice chairman of the executive board of the foundation. The foundation was founded by former US ambassador Andrew Young and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, former German minister of foreign affairs. The idea for founding the center was inspired by Hans-Dietrich Genscher's guiding principle “winners vs. losers – that's not how the new world order should be. Everybody should have their share of the winning side. In affirming the interests of others lies a chance for oneself”. As academic leader Andreas Suchanek is responsible to develop the theoretical groundwork of the Wittenberg-Center with the aim for the guiding principle to increasingly take root in the society. A number of well-known businesses and organizations as well as important personalities from the spheres of politics, economy, church, culture and science support the Wittenberg-Center's work.
As an expert in questions of corporate social responsibility Suchanek advises global businesses from various economic branches.
Theory.
Suchanek's studies focus on economy and business ethics, sustainability, trust and credibility management as well as interaction ethics. By using decision and game theory methods, which view the question of competition and cooperation not as contradiction but as chance to win cooperation, Suchanek developed the economically reformed golden rule: invest in the conditions of social collaboration for mutual advantage.
Being a member of the core team of HHL - Leipzig Graduate School of Management, he developed the Leipzig Leadership Model, which was published in 2016, along with Manfred Kirchgeorg, Timo Meynhardt, Andreas Pinkwart and Henning Zülch.
