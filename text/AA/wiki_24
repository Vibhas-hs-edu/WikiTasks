Sadiq Sanjrani

Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani (; born 14 April 1978) is a Pakistani politician who is from Balochistan and is the 8th and current Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan. He took his oath of office as Member and Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan on 12 March 2018. He is the youngest and first-ever Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan who hails from the province of Balochistan. He belongs from the well educated Sanjrani tribe. 
Early life and education.
Sanjrani was born on 14 April 1978&lt;ref name="dawn/12march2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in Nok Kundi, Balochistan, Pakistan.&lt;ref name="geo/12march2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He received his early education from Nok Kundi and then moved to Islamabad from where he did his degree. 
Political career.
Sanjrani began his political career in 1998 as coordinator of the team of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif where he served until 1999 Pakistani coup d'état.
In 2008, he was appointed in-charge of the Prime Minister's Yousaf Raza Gillani Grievance Cell at the Prime Minister's Secretariat where he remained for five years.
Sanjrani was elected to the Senate of Pakistan as an independent candidate on general seat from Balochistan in 2018 Pakistani Senate election. He took oath as Senator on 12 March 2018. On the same day, he was elected as 8th Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="tribune/12march2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thenews/12march2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He received 57 votes out of total 103 votes cast and defeated Raja Zafar ul Haq, a candidate of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) who obtained 46 votes. Sanjrani was voted into chairman position by the Pakistan Peoples Party, Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and independent Senators from Balochistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. He became the first ever Chairman of the Senate who hailed from province of Balochistan&lt;ref name="dawn1/12march2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and became the youngest-ever Chairman of the Senate at the age of 39. He was relatively lesser known figure in Pakistan's political spectrum prior to being elected as Chairman of the Senate.
In September 2018, Sanjrani addressed the National Assembly of Azerbaijan on the eve of its 100th anniversary.
On the 1st of August 2019, a no-confidence motion was presented by the opposition parties in the senate to remove him from the post of the Chairman of the Senate. The resolution was tabled in the Senate with 64 senators in support of it. The no-confidence motion failed to pass because the opposition parties only gathered 50 votes, 3 votes short of the resolution passing. Sanjrani still stands as the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan after having survived the no-confidence vote. This was seen as a clear victory to the PTI government coalition and a confirmation of senators having confidence in the chairman.
On 12 March 2021, He was re-elected as Chairman of Senate of Pakistan defeating his rival Syed Yusuf Raza Gillani.

DIY Space for London

DIY Space for London is a volunteer-run social centre, music venue, rehearsal space, and creative hub formerly located at 96-108 Ormside Street in South Bermondsey, London.
History.
The space opened in September 2015 after the founding collective at first struggled for two years to find a suitable location.
The collective, started in 2012, raised £20,000 through benefit gigs, events, and community grants to secure a five year lease.
Inspired by other social centres such as 1 in 12 Club in Bradford, their goal was to, "create a sustainable, collectively run space to put gigs on, hold meetings and building a communal infrastructure" that would be "run by its members and open for anyone to get involved in." It has ten interlinked volunteer collectives taking care of running the space.
Whether volunteering or attending, the space is both functionally and legally a members' club. As of June 2017 this was over 5000 members.
Volunteers of the space hosted a radio show showcasing the type of musicians to appear there on NTS Radio between 2016 and 2017.
Since 2016 the space has held First Timers, a yearly series of workshops culminating in a two day festival that encourages "new faces and voices in bands", in order to "do something about the lack of diversity in the music community".
Over the weekend of 2-4 June 2017, DIY Diaspora Punx (a collective started by Stephanie Phillips of Big Joanie, and also containing other London musicians such as Rachel Aggs) put on the first Decolonise Fest at DIY Space for London. Decolonise Fest is the UK's first music festival created by and for people of colour. The second edition of the festival (again mostly held at DIY Space) occurred from 22 to 24 June 2018, with a third over 29 to 30 June 2019.
On 12 June 2020 the collective announced due to temporary closures enforced due to the they had been unable to renew their lease on their current premises and would be seeking a new location.
Notable performers.

1924 Women's Olympiad

The 1924 Women's Olympiad (formally called "Women's International and British Games", French "Grand meeting international féminin") was the first international competition for women in track and field in the United Kingdom. The tournament was held on 4 August 1924 in London, United Kingdom.
Events.
After the successful first 1922 Women's World Games in Paris and the three Women's Olympiads (1921 Women's Olympiad, 1922 Women's Olympiad and 1923 Women's Olympiad) in Monaco the interest for women's sports also grew internationally. In 1922 the "Women's Amateur Athletic Association" (WAAA) was founded in the UK: the WAAA organised the first official British women championships in track and field (WAAA Championships) on 18 August 1923 at the Oxo Sports Ground in Downham outside London. In the US the "Amateur Athletic Union" (AAU) organised the first official American women championships in track and field on 29 September 1923 at Weequahic Park in Newark, New Jersey.
The 1924 Women's Olympiad was organised in cooperation with the newspapers News of the World, Sporting Life and Daily Mirror in cooperation with the WAAA and the Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale (FSFI) under chairwoman Alice Milliat.
The games were attended by participants from 8 nations: Belgium, Canada (exhibition events only), Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the USA (exhibition events only). The tournament was a huge promotion for women's sports.
The athletes competed in 12 events: running (100 yards, 250 metres, 1000 metres, Relay race 4 x 110 yards and 4 x 220 yards and 120 yards, Racewalking 1000 metres, high jump, long jump, discus throw, shot put and javelin. The tournament also held exhibition events in cycling (two-thirds of a mile bicycle sprint), netball, and gymnastics.
The multi-sport event was held at "Stamford Bridge" in Fulham in southwest London. The games attended an audience of 25,000 spectators.
Results.
Almost all medals went to athletes from France and the United Kingdom.
During the games 7 world records were set: Mary Lines in hurdling 120 yd and running 250 m, Edith Trickey in running 1000 m, Albertine Regel in walking 1000 m, Elise van Truyen in high jump, Violett Morris in discus and Louise Groslimond in javelin. Poorly performed measuring however led to that only 2 records, Trickey in running 1000 metres and Regel in walking 1000 metres, later were ratified.
Results in each event:
Legacy.
The tournament was a huge promotion for women's sports, a follow-up was held in 1925 ("Daily Mirror Trophy") also at Stamford Bridge. In 1926 the second regular Women's World Games were held at Gothenburg.

All Creatures Great and Small (franchise)

The All Creatures Great and Small franchise consists of a series of books written by James Alfred Wight under the pen name "James Herriot" based on his experiences as a veterinary surgeon. The books have been adapted for film and television, including a 1975 film titled "All Creatures Great and Small", followed by the 1976 "It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" sequel, as well as on television a long-running BBC television programme of the same title, and a prequel series in 2011, "Young James Herriot".
By 2020, the series of books featuring James Herriot had sold some 60 million copies. In that year, the next television production was aired, "All Creatures Great and Small". The programme, produced for Channel 5 in the UK and PBS in America, was renewed for a second set of episodes.
Books.
The book series focuses on the adventures of veterinary surgeon "James Herriot", and are set in the Yorkshire Dales, in the fictional town of "Darrowby", based on a combination of Thirsk, Richmond, Leyburn and Middleham. In the books, Herriot works with fellow veterinary surgeons "Siegfried" and "Tristan Farnon", based on real-life counterparts, Donald Sinclair and his brother Brian Sinclair respectively. Wight also used the name "Helen Alderson" for his wife, Joan Danbury. 
Joan Danbury, in real life was not a farmer’s daughter but worked as a secretary. According to one source, "contrary to the stories, Alf Wight met her in a group outing to a local dance. Evidently, he felt she was worth pursuing from the first, though she had a number of boyfriends and admirers".
In addition to the primary books listed below, a series of nine James Herriot Children’s Picture Books were published. Another 12 books, considered to be "anthologies" (with content taken from various of the primary books) was also published, some in the UK and others in the US. 
US series.
In America the books were collected as pairs into omnibus volumes, as the publisher felt they were too short to publish independently. The title chosen for the first book in the series "All Creatures Great and Small" (and subsequently of the movies and television series) was taken from the hymn "All Things Bright and Beautiful". According to Herriot's son, it was his sister who suggested the title, initially proposing "All Creatures Great and Small".
Films.
"All Creatures Great and Small" (1975).
"All Creatures Great and Small" is based on first two novels, "If Only They Could Talk" (1970) and "It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" (1972), and was given the same title as the 1972 US compilation volume of these two novels, was released in 1975. It was directed by Claude Whatham, and written by Hugh Whitemore, and starred Simon Ward as James Herriot and Anthony Hopkins as Siegfried Farnon. 
"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" (1976).
"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" is based on the two following novels, "Let Sleeping Vets Lie" (1973) and "Vet in Harness" (1974), and was released in 1976. It was directed by Eric Till, written by Alan Plater, and starred John Alderton as James Herriot and Colin Blakely as Siegfried Farnon.
Television.
"All Creatures Great and Small" (1978–1990).
"All Creatures Great and Small" is a BBC television series based initially on the first two books, "If Only They Could Talk" (1970) and "It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" (1972). As the novels are written in an episodic style, with each chapter generally containing a short story within the ongoing narrative of Herriot's life, this facilitated their adaptation for a television series by producer Bill Sellars. The series stars Christopher Timothy as James Herriot and Robert Hardy as Siegfried Farnon, and it had two runs: the original (1978 to 1980, based directly on Herriot's books) was for three series; the second (1988 to 1990, filmed with original scripts) for four. Series 4 saw the introduction of new vet, Calum Buchanan (John McGlynn), based on Herriot's real-life assistant Brian Nettleton. A total of ninety episodes were broadcast.
"Young James Herriot" (2011).
"Young James Herriot" is a three-part BBC television series based on the life of veterinary student James Herriot. It was based on notes in the Herriot archive and the archives of the Glasgow Veterinary College, including the diaries and case notes the author kept during his student years, and was produced with the cooperation of his family. The series was directed by Michael Keillor and written by Ann McManus and Eileen Gallagher. It stars Iain De Caestecker as Herriot, with Amy Manson and Ben Lloyd-Hughes as fellow students Whirly Tyson and Rob McAloon.
"All Creatures Great and Small" (2020–).
In 2019, Channel 5 announced it would be filming a new series in the Yorkshire Dales over the summer of 2019, to be broadcast the following year. Instead of using Askrigg as the filming base, the producers decided on Grassington, due to the former's A roads detracting from the 1930s look they wanted. There was never a plan to film in Thirsk where the actual James Herriot (Alf Wight) practiced because it had become too large for the small town feel that the series wanted.
Significant changes were made from the source material (both the previous television series and the memoir), such as Siegfried Farnon being a heartbroken widower and a dramatically increased role for Mrs. Hall, who has been reimagined as a young, live-in housekeeper and a "slightly warmer figure" than in the novels. The role of Helen was also greatly expanded.
This first series consisted of six episodes plus a Christmas special and aired first on Channel 5 (in 2020) and then (in early 2021) on PBS in the United States. "All Creatures Great and Small" was renewed for a second series. All of the principal actors were expected to return to their roles. It was scheduled to begin filming in the Yorkshire Dales in late March 2021. 
The World of James Herriot.
The World of James Herriot is a writer's home museum attraction in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, England. 
The museum was set up in 1999 by Hambleton District Council; the business was sold to private investors in 2011 and was re-generated in 2017. Council leases the building to the operators but retains ownership of the structure. As of February 2021, the World of James Herriot Ltd board included the daughter and son of Alf Wight: Rosie Page and retired vet John Wight, in addition to a group of "local businessmen and women".

Fat (2013 film)

Fat is a 2013 American drama film directed by Mark Phinney filmed in Boston, MA. It also showcases the Boston music scene prominently on its soundtrack and music plays a major driving role in the film. It had its world premiere on September 8, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival and stars Mel Rodriguez as Ken, a food-addicted man struggling with getting his life in order.
The film was released in select theaters and via video on demand platforms on December 15, 2015.
Synopsis.
Ken won't change his ways. Addicted to food, Ken is in bad health, and is headed to an early grave. Despite getting help and advice from his friends and doctors, he does what he wants, when he wants; until a chance encounter with love that might just give him the motivation he needs to save himself."
Reception.
Critical reception for "Fat" has been predominantly positive with a 60% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes. The film has been particularly praised for its gritty, realistic look at food addiction. In its October 30, 2015 issue, "The Globe and Mail" said, "The story, inspired by the writer-comedian and first-time director Mark Phinney's own life, is told in pseudo-documentary style. A dark film about shame and self-sabotage, Fat is not a pretty picture. The truthful ones rarely are." James Verniere of "The Boston Herald" gave the film an A-, noting, "What writer/director Mark Phinney’s semi-autobiographical fiction film 'Fat' lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in brutal honesty, insight and genuine rage."
Matt Goldberg of Collider gave the film a more mixed review and a B- grade, but also noted its realistic depiction of the topic: "Fat still manages to hold together long enough to keep its emotional impact intact, and it serves as a cautionary tale without ever feeling preachy. It can disgust, depress, and frustrate, but it doesn’t patronize its audience. Phinney’s film isn’t designed to be motivational but observational. The distance provided by the documentary style makes the strong performances come to us. It’s only when the plot forces a maudlin conclusion that Fat can only mirror the pain of obesity by (to borrow a lyric from Nirvana) taking comfort in being sad."

<doc id="56739018" url="?curid=56739018" title="Sharp power">
Sharp power

Sharp power is the use of manipulative diplomatic policies by one country to influence and undermine the political system of a target country. 
History.
The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) popularised the term "sharp power" (in use since the early-19th century) in November 2017; it appeared in an article in "Foreign Affairs" magazine describing aggressive and subversive policies employed by authoritarian governments as a projection of state power in democratic countries, policies that cannot be described as either hard power or soft power. The NED article specifically names the Russian state-funded RT News Network and the Chinese state-sponsored Confucius Institute educational partnerships as examples of sharp power. According NED, autocratic states "are not necessarily seeking to "win hearts and minds" (the common frame of reference for soft power efforts}, but they are surely seeking to manipulate their target audiences by distorting the information that reaches them.
Since 2018 the term "sharp power" has been used in news articles, scholarly discussions, and Congressional hearings. Representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have used the phrase, dismissing Western claims that their country has engaged in sharp-power practices.
Overview.
Sharp power can include attempts by one country to manipulate and manage information about itself in the news media and educational systems of another country, for the purpose of misleading or dividing public opinion in a target country, or for masking or diverting attention away from negative information about itself.
The link between sharp power and authoritarian regime is, as stated Christophe Walker "This approach takes advantage of the asymmetry between free and unfree systems, allowing authoritarian regimes both to limit free expression and to distort political environments in democracies while simultaneously shielding their own domestic public spaces from democratic appeals coming from abroad.” making sharp power easier to use for an authoritarian regime than a democratic one.
Soft power policies can include student exchanges and the sponsoring of cultural and sporting events. Sharp power is distinguished from soft power, which are attractive policies that project a positive impression of one country and promote greater understanding with another country, ultimately to influence the decisions of another country through persuasion. Sharp power is also distinct from hard power, which are coercive policies by one country to compel another country into taking action or changing its decisions. Hard power can include military force, economic sanctions, and diplomatic threats.
Sharp power often has a digital element to it. In particular Chinese exercises in sharp power are carried out almost entirely online.

Zora (magazine)

The Zora (, ) was a literature journal published by Serb intelligentsia between 1896 and 1901 in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina under Austro-Hungarian rule. The "Zora" was published monthly, in Serbian Cyrillic. Its chief editor was Aleksa Šantić. Besides Šantić, members of its editorial team were Svetozar Ćorović, Jovan Dučić and Atanasije Šola (Šola was one of its editors although his name was not presented in the first several issues of Zora).
History.
The request to allow publishing of the "Zora" was submitted on 30 November 1895 to the Government in Sarajevo. Austrian intelligence reported that its editor, Aleksa Šantić, was involved with politics, but "within limits". Benjamin Kallay accepted positive opinion of the Government in Sarajevo, after extensive correspondence between Kotar governor - Government in Sarajevo - County of Mostar, and on 28 February 1896 allowed publishing of the journal. He also wrote detailed instructions to the Mostar County how to surveil and censor future journal to prevent it becoming political journal instead of literature one. The first edition was published on 30 April 1896.
The literature magazin "Zora" was published under patronage of "Serbian Singing Society "Gusle"". Šantić became the editor-in-chief of this magazine review "Zora" (Dawn; 1896–1901) published by Serbian Cultural Society in Mostar which was among the most important societies which struggled for preservation of Serb cultural autonomy and national rights. "Zora" became one of the best Serbian literature magazines. The journal Zora gathered members of the Serbian intelligentsia who strived to improve education of Serbian population necessary to reach economic and political progress. Šantić and Ćorović invited people to subscribe to Zora emphasizing that they founded this magazine to "inform part of Serbs who live here about the spiritual legacy of their greatest sons, with the best representatives of modern Serbian literature".
Legacy.
In honor of centinel of the birth of Aleksa Šantić an honorable the Zora was republished in 1968 in Mostar.

Visconti Park

The Visconti Park or Parco Visconteo is an area in Lombardy, northern Italy, between Pavia and Certosa di Pavia of about corresponding to what was once the private park of the Visconti family, lords and dukes of Milan.
The original park.
The park was initially conceived as part of the project of the Pavia castle, built after 1360 by decision of Galeazzo II Visconti. To the same period goes back the idea to reserve a large area, north to the castle, to the private leisure and hunting of the Visconti family. Thirty years later Gian Galeazzo Visconti added a further portion of land (Parco Nuovo, the New Park) to the first part (Parco Vecchio, the Old Park). With this extension the park reached to the north the Charterhouse of Pavia founded few years before by the Visconti as well with the purpose to host the family mausoleum.
The park was encircled by walls and accessible by gates. The total length of the wall along the perimeter of the park is estimated to be about 25 km. Inside the park manors, farmsteads, ponds with hydraulic arrangements and pathways were built. At its center the Mirabello Castle, seat of the Captain of the Park, was erected. In some part the vegetation was designed with recreational purposes or to accommodate animal species either autoctone or exotic. In other parts the agricultural activities were maintained in continuity with the external areas.
The original Visconti Park is considered an archetype of the modern parks as an area set aside by local authorities and modified with techniques of landscape architecture. In its hunting purposes it can be compared to the English deer parks. The complex of the Visconti Park, the Pavia castle and the Certosa di Pavia constitutes the first example in Europe of a royal palace connected to an enclosed park with a private chapel or other buildings. The nearest example visible today is the royal villa and park of Monza realized about four centuries later.
Disuse and decay.
After the rule of Ludovico Maria Sforza (1489-1494) the park was progressively abandoned and its features deteriorated. In 1525 it was the theater of the Battle of Pavia fought between French and Imperial–Spanish forces. The walls of the park were damaged by the armies while manoeuvring during the battle. In the following centuries the masonry of the wall, offering bricks for the reuse in the nearby peasant houses, went through a general demise up to its complete demolition.
The park nowadays.
The Visconti Park today has few signs of the original features, being mainly dedicated to agriculture like the area external to it. Of the Mirabello Castle, having originally a quadrilateral layout, only one side has survived. Remains of two gates are visible at Torre del Mangano and in San Genesio (Porta Pescarina). The other gates survive only in place names. 
To facilitate the visit of the park, bike routes and thematical tours are proposed by local authorities.

Brussels Soldiers' Council

A Soldiers' Council () was established in Brussels on 10 November 1918 after news of the naval mutiny at Kiel and the November Revolution reached German troops in German-occupied Belgium in the final days of World War I. Intended as a kind of revolutionary council and socialist and communist in inspiration, it was created after the soldiers mutinied against their officers and seized control of Brussels which had been occupied since August 1914. They tried unsuccessfully to create an alliance with Belgian civilians and socialists and there was sporadic fighting in the city between right-wing and revolutionary soldiers. At the same time, the Soldiers' Council struggled to maintain law and order. Its chief concern was to secure the repatriation of its men to Germany. After a few days, the council disbanded and the final German troops left Brussels on 16 November. The Belgian Army under King Albert I finally entered the city on 22 November 1918.
The Brussels soldiers' council was contemporary with another similar body established at Beverloo at the same time. Both looked to the more important soldiers' council at Cologne for nominal leadership.

FS Class 170

FS Class 170 was a class of steam locomotives acquired by Italian State Railways (FS) from Rete Mediterranea (RM) on nationalization in 1905.
History.
These locomotives were received by the Mediterranean Network in 1885 following the division of earlier railways between three major networks. They were locomotives for fast passenger trains and most came from the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI). They were all of foreign construction. The oldest were delivered from Koechlin of Mulhouse between 1873 and 1874 and accounted for more than half of the total quantity. The subsequent orders, made by RM, were to Maffei of Munich who delivered them between 1884 and 1889. Eight locomotives were built by the Société Franco-Belge between 1888 and 1889. They were finally acquired by FS in 1905 on nationalization. In the FS locomotive list, at 31 December 1914, 60 units were registered. They were divided into two groups with different technical characteristics and some functional and aesthetic variations.
Technical details.
The locomotive was built with a wheel arrangement, with very large 2.030 mm diameter wheels and a front axle with 8 mm side-play allowed. It was typical of the passenger locomotives of the time. It used saturated steam and had two outside cylinders with simple expansion. The boiler pressure was 10 bar. A three-axle tender of total mass 29 tonnes (26 tonnes in the second group) was coupled to the locomotives. The water capacity was 10 m³ and the coal capacity was 3.5 tonnes (3 tonnes in the second group). All locomotives were equipped with automatic compressed air brake equipment. Some machines were also equipped with a steam brake while only no. 1715 had a proportional compressed air brake. All the machines were able to provide steam heating for passenger carriages.

Seaview Harbor, New Jersey

Seaview Harbor is a harbor and an unincorporated community located within Egg Harbor Township in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States.
Location.
Located along New Jersey Route 152 (NJ 152), Seaview Harbor borders the Great Egg Harbor Bay, and is separated from neighboring Longport by Beach Thorofare. The harbor community is non-contiguous from the rest of Egg Harbor Township, separated from municipal facilities by about . Seaview Harbor shares a zip code with neighboring Longport, whose postmaster handles mail for the community. Longport also provides first response for fire and medical emergencies, as well as most police matters, at no cost to the township.
History.
Seaview Harbor subdivision was first envisioned in 1957 as a "planned community for the boating family", and housing units were gradually added. In the 1960s and 1970s, storms damaged bulkheads in the community, forcing residents to finance their own breakwater. By the mid-1970s, Egg Harbor Township began providing trash pickup. The township installed a public sewer system by 1994. In 2009, a traffic light was installed at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and NJ 152.
Within Seaview Harbor, there are currently 92 single-family homes, two vacant residential lots, a utility lot, and Seaview Harbor Marina. The namesake marina has 300 slips, a restaurant, a store, a fuel dock, and a private beach. The properties of Seaview Harbor, representing an area of , is assessed at over $100 million.
In 2012, a tax reevaluation rose taxes in Seaview Harbor by 60%. In 2014, 69 residents of Seaview Harbor submitted a petition to leave Egg Harbor Township and join nearby Longport. This represented about 80% of registered voters in the community. Among the concerns was confusion and lost mail, due to uncertainty whether the area was a part of Longport or Egg Harbor Township, as well as the high taxes. Over two years, the township held 25 meetings exploring the community's deannexation, at the cost of $87,800 in legal and engineering fees. Longtime Egg Harbor Township mayor James J. McCullough lives in Seaview Harbor, and recused himself from the secession hearings. The mayor of Longport, Nicholas Russo, was neutral on the matter. A 500-page report released in January 2016 concluded that Seaview Harbor did not meet the criteria to secede from the township. The report cited the lack of continuity with Longport, as the only connection is NJ 152. The secession would also negatively impact the rest of Egg Harbor Township, including a $505,000 loss in taxes. On November 30, 2016, the Egg Harbor Township Committee voted 4-0 to deny the deannexation.

Bundesstraße 301

The Bundesstraße 301 (abbr. B301) is a German federal highway in Bavaria, which leads in two parts from Abensberg to Fischerhäuser, a district of Ismaning.
Route description.
Northern section.
The northern section begins at Abensberg and runs through the Hallertau via Mainburg to Freising. From Abensberg to Attenkirchen it is also called "Deutsche Hopfenstraße" (). Because of the increasing traffic, among other things due to the connection of the Munich Airport, a five kilometers long bypass around Au in der Hallertau was built and released for traffic in December 2011. With the rededication of the B11 between Munich and Moosburg to the State Road 2350, the part of the B11 between the previous end of the B301 and Marzling, and the feeder road (previously B11a) was rededicated to B301, so that the route ends at the exit "Freising-Ost" since then.
Southern section.
The section south of Freising exists since 2013 and is also referred as "Isarparallele". The main road begins at the junction "Freising-Mitte" on the A92 and ends in Fischerhäuser on the B388. It complements the road links of the airport and was the upgraded former county road "FS44" (A 92-Hallbergmoos) and a new line which was built between 31 August 2009 and the traffic release on 30 July 2013 at a cost of around 29 million euros. The newly built route between Fischerhäuser and Goldach runs directly next to the tracks of the Munich East–Munich Airport railway. In the area of the junction to the airport shuttle from the A92, the main road next to this railway line also crosses the Neufahrner Spange which leads to the Munich–Regensburg railway.
Traffic volume.
For 2020, a traffic load of 20,000 vehicles per day is forecast for this section.
Future.
North-East bypass Freising (Nord-Ost-Umfahrung Freising).
For the almost bypass of Freising is already a plan approval decision before and the first construction work has begun. The route is to branch off at Erlau from the existing road and meet at Marzling on the State Road 2350 (former B11) and the above-described motorway feeder.
Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2030).
The first draft bill as part of the preparation of the "FTIP 2030" was made public on 16 March 2016. The publication of the draft bill was followed by a six-week public participation. After evaluating the comments received, a revised cabinet draft was available, in which the bypass around Mainburg was included in the urgent need. After the referendum at the end of July 2016, the Federal Cabinet approved the plan on 3 August 2016.

Sennertia

Sennertia is a genus of mites in the Chaetodactylidae family. There are more than 70 species. Some of these mites are parasites or commensals of bees, but the presence in some bees of specialized structures for carrying mites (acarinarium) indicates the mutualistic nature of the relationship of some species ("Sennertia sayutara", "Sennertia devincta"). Most species of the genus "Sennertia" settle on adult bees as heteromorphic deutonymphs, but the species "Sennertia vaga" has no deutonymph and settle on adult bees in the eating adult stages. Reproduction and feeding occurs during resettlement. Most species occur on small carpenter bees ("Ceratina") and large carpenter bees ("Xylocopa") of the family Apidae. A few species ("Sennertia" "vaga"-group) are associated with "Centris" ("Paracentris") in the Neotropics.
Distribution.
"Sennertia" are found worldwide, except for in the Antarctic. (The species" Sennertia antarctica" is likely erroneously named, as the species of bee it parasitizes is not found in the Antarctic).
Species.
There are 6 subgenera and more than 70 species. The genus was discovered by the Dutch zoologist A.K. Udemans ("Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans"; 1858—1943).

Battle of Zaraysk

In the Battle of Zaraisk, during the Time of Troubles, on April 9, 1608, Colonel Alexander Lisovsky in service of False Dmitry II, defeated the army of Tsar Vasily IV under Zahariya Lyapunov and Ivan Khovansky.
Prelude.
Zaraysk was occupied without a fight by Lisovsky detachments (1500 Cossacks: "Lithuanian people and Russian thieves"), as the city Cossacks surrendered the city and swore to the Pretender.
Battle.
To suppress the insurrection, an army from Ryazan land came out, to which 250 elite Arzamas warriors joined. The government army carelessly besieged the fort (with no guards appointed), and the sudden sally of Lisovsky's men from the Zaraisk Kremlin scattered them with little resistance.
Aftermath.
After the victory at Zaraisk, Lisovskiy swiftly captured Kolomna, where he captured many heavy guns. His army was strengthened by the remnants of former Bolotnikovites. However, the detachment of Lisovsky, heavily burdened by the convoy, was defeated by the Tsar's army at Medvezhiy Brod.

Berlin Homeless Shelter Association

The Berlin Homeless Shelter Association (or Berliner Asyl-Verein für Obdachlose) is a charity for the homeless based in Berlin, Germany.
Background.
The enormous growth of Berlin as an industrial city and metropole within the newly-formed German Empire led to a wave of immigrants which even the most speculative building programmes could not accommodate. In 1871 alone, more than 130,000 people moved to Berlin. They slept on the streets, in attics, the cattle sheds of the central slaughterhouse, the cheapest boarding houses and shacks. Alcoholism, thievery and prostitution were often their fate. Epidemics ran rife. In winter, tens of thousands more streamed into Berlin after the countryside harvest came to an end. Young girls arriving at the station in the hope of obtaining work as domestic servants were often lured away and forced into prostitution.
Beginnings.
The Berlin Homeless Shelter Association was founded in 1868 in Berlin by members of the Friedrichs-Werdeschen-Bezirksverein. The awareness that an individual is not necessarily responsible for his or her homeless condition and that police custody is also not a useful way to deal with the problem led to the founding of the homeless association by engaged and motivated Berlin citizens. Led by banker, Gustav Thölde, its members included industrialist August Borsig, head of the city council Friedrich Kochhann, chaplain Friedrich Gustav Lisco, physician Rudolf Virchow, factory owner, and socialist Paul Singer, and Chief of Police Lothar von Wurmb, amongst others. Thölde remained the association's chairman until his death in 1910.
The association, virtually a ‘Who’s who’ of the Berlin bourgeoisie, was notable for its large number of high-ranking members of Berlin society. Its articles included the daily presence of the members in the association's work. How far those mentioned kept to this requirement is unclear although this example is a characteristic feature of the bourgeoisie of that time. That the association was rooted in the more affluent levels of society meant that the association could exist functionally and financially for a comparatively long time. At the end of the century, it had 4–5,000 members and was financed from donations, legacies, foundations and bequests, as well as charity benefits which raised considerable sums of money for the association. However, many less affluent citizens and social democratic workers counted among its members.
The association was supported above all by liberal Berlin Jews. When a call for donations was made in the Vossischen Zeitung in 1893, many anti-semitic postcards were received in response: "I do not donate to the Berliner Asyl-Verein für Obdachlose because of its exclusively Jewish supporters."
First shelters.
The priority was the construction of a women's shelter. On 7 December 1868, the association had already signed a rental contract for a former artillery workshop on the corner of Dorotheenstaße and Wilhelmstraße. A call for donations went out to the Berlin population on 12 December. People were urged to join the association or support it with contributions. At this point, there was accommodation for 60 people who could sleep on metal beds with sprung mattresses in contrast to the unhygienic wooden beds of other establishments.
A men's shelter administered by Paul Singer followed in 1873, in Büschungstraße 4 in former Königstadt, near the women's prison. Today a memorial plaque can be found there.
In 1876, the association registered 105,000 stays and by the end of 1892, around 2.5 million.
The Wiesenburg.
In 1896, a new building in Wiesenstraße in Gesundbrunnen between the Panke canal and the Berlin Ringbahn (circle line) was ready to accommodate 700 men in the 12,000 m² complex. A large donation from Dr Moritz Gerson, amongst others, funded the construction; 400 workers completed the shelter in one year. The site had been carefully chosen: previous experiences with the neighbours of the Friedrichshain house, who felt harassed by the sight of miserable people and claimed that their children were endangered by the homeless, led the association to look for a site as shielded from the neighbourhood as possible. The shelter had a 50 m ‘private street’, to clear 700 men from the Wiesenstraße as quickly as possible, a small, attractive garden lay at the front, the circle line protected it to the north and the Panke canal to the west.
The shelter, called "Die Wiesenburg" in popular parlance, was designed by the architects, and . The house, still standing and in use today, provided conference rooms for the association and living accommodation for the shelter's employees. Paul Singer was the shelter's administrator, Georg Toebelmann and Rudolf Virchow took charge of hygiene. The shelter was fitted out to the most advanced standards of the day, produced its own electricity, had its own water supply, central heating and air conditioning. It provided dormitories and dining hall, showers and baths with warm water, a library and the possibility to have one's clothes disinfected and washed. Almost every room had electric lighting and running water, and the terrazzo floor was easy to clean. 
Compared to other shelters run by the church or the government, the homeless here were not forced to work nor required to attend religious services. They could remain anonymous. The police were not allowed to enter the premises. Until 1914, overnight guests were provided with soup and bread in the evenings and coffee and a bread roll in the mornings. This humane treatment of the homeless stood in stark contrast to, e.g., ‘’, a government-run shelter in Fröbelstraße, Prenzlauerberg, where homeless persons attempting to stay longer than five nights were sent to a workhouse in Rummelsberg to build irrigation fields outside the city. Or the ‘’ in Reinickendorferstraße, Wedding, run on lines dictated by Pastor von Bodelschwingh, who insisted on religious services and required the men to chop wood or break stones for their overnight stay.
In 1906, the shelter was extended to provide 882 places for men and 400 for women. The whole shelter was used not only by the homeless but also migrant workers, seasonal harvest workers and domestic workers. At this time, the shelter was providing far more than 300,000 overnight stays per year.
At the beginning of the 1st World War, a firm producing canned goods for the army moved into the women's shelter. By its end, the donation-dependent association was in financial difficulties, and its activities came to a halt for the time being. After the war, the men's shelter was used by commercial firms and some rooms were used as accommodation for Jewish immigrants from the East. In 1924, the SUM-Vergaser-Gesellschaft produced carburettors for motorbikes and aeroplanes on the site(later ), eventually taking over the whole of the women's shelter. The association was able to reorganise itself in 1926, and the men's shelter reopened, but only with financial help from the state, who insisted on applying the rules of state-run shelters, thus ending the anonymity of its visitors and the independence of the association. State funding ceased in 1931 due to the world financial crisis and the shelter closed forever.
In 1933, the ‘National Socialist People's Welfare’ (NSV) requisitioned the association's assets. Further industrial tenants moved in, among them a dye firm who produced the party flags for the 1936 Olympic Games (the concrete dyeing vats still stand in the ruin of the former bath and shower room). With the Third Reich's armament policy, SUM became a much larger firm and moved to bigger premises in Michaelkirchstraße, Kreuzberg, where forced labour was used to build weapons.
In the early 1940s, a tinned goods firm and the foundry company, Pemietsreider, who made weapons for the German war effort, moved in. Pemetsrieder (previously located in Moabit) was based in the Wiesenburg until 1980.
In 1944/45, large parts of the men's dormitories and the washrooms were destroyed by Allied bombing. The administration house and parts of the women's shelter escaped undamaged. Traces of the conflict are still visible; bullet and grenade splinter holes from the last days of the war dot the walls. The building lay on the last main battle line of the surrounded Third Reich capital: the circle line along its northern perimeter, defended by broken-down soldiers from the front, the home guard, policemen and Hitler Youth.
In the 1950s, various small companies moved in and bombed-out families lived in the still-standing parts of the shelter.
In the 1980s, an attempt to build high-rise flats on the area was blocked by the Cultural Heritage Office, who added The Wiesenburg to their list of protected buildings. Parts of the remaining buildings fell into disrepair, artists and craftspeople people moved in and repaired the rooms for their own purposes. Spiegel online described the Wiesenburg in 2015 as "a dreamy place… a secret tip. Crumbing walls, wild vines fall over empty windows, a birch tree spreads its roots into a stairway, mysterious doors. (…) A Swedish artist from Stockholm has his studio here, and dancers practise for their performances, an artist builds his wooden sculptures. There is a music studio, a concert room and a huge, wild garden. The city has few such places that are so enchanting."
Cultural activities.
Many figures from the literary and political worlds visited the Wiesenburg during the Weimar Republic to familiarise themselves with the association and become acquainted with the milieu. These visitors included Hans Fallada, whose character, Rieke Busch, a Wedding street urchin, described it as "Where the tramps and vagabonds sleep when they don’t have anywhere else to stay", in his book, "Ein Mann will nach oben".
The Wiesenburg was used as the setting for numerous films. Amongst others, Fritz Lang shot scenes from M and Fritz Weiss from "Der Vagabund" (1929). In November 1978, the men's reception hall served as the setting for the fire at the Danzig synagogue (also designed by Georg Toebelmann) during the Night of Broken Glass (Kristallnacht) in Volker Schlöndorff’s "The Tin Drum". In the same year, scenes from Hans Fallada's "" and in 1981, Rainer Werner Fassbinder's "Lili Marleen" were filmed here.
Planned renovation and reconstruction.
After a lengthy dispute about the association’s legal succession to the Wiesenburg, the courts eventually decided that it belonged to the Berlin state, who transferred it on 1 April 2014 to their municipal housing association, Degewo. At the end of March 2015, they informed the tenants that they would soon close off large parts of the complex as they were no longer secure and were in danger of collapse. The residents protested against this closure of areas that had developed over the years into spaces for art, culture and out-of-school educational locations for pupils in the district. Nationwide press coverage followed. At the beginning of April 2015, Degewo announced that current tenants would not be required to move out and that each step of the reconstruction would be carried out in dialogue with them.
In October 2015, the "Soziale Stadt" (Social City) committee of the district council held its meeting in the Wiesenburg and unanimously agreed that the association, Die Wiesenburg e.V., and the QM (neighbourhood management) Pankstraße should be involved in the planning and development stages. The association produced a development concept which was highly recommended in the committee meeting and selected for the ‘Players of Change’ conference for innovative urban development ideas in Holzmarkt, Berlin.
At the end of November/beginning of December 2015, Degewo closed all studios and workshops – again because of an alleged possibility of collapse. Discussions between Degewo and the tenants' statistician and lawyer reversed this decision and they were able to move back in three weeks later. Since January 2016, Degewo has continued to carry out further safety measures so that the current activities on the site can continue without danger to life and limb.
In 2018, Degewo plan to start construction of around a hundred flats in the ‘garden’ (the previous site of the men's and women's dormitories). The former reception halls of the men's and the women's shelters will become spaces for cultural activities, and part of the garden will become a ‘green classroom’. The studios and workshops will remain and be renovated to a basic standard to avoid sudden high rent rises for the current tenants.

The Icelandic Women's Super Cup (Icelandic: "Meistarakeppni kvenna") is an annual football game between the reigning champions of the Icelandic League (Úrvalsdeild) champions and the Icelandic Cup holders (or, if the same team holds both titles, between the title-holder and (usually) the team in second place in the Úrvalsdeild or occasionally the second placed team in the Icelandic Cup). It generally takes place at the start of the Iceland domestic season, in May and has been running uninterrupted since 2003 (when the holders of the 2002 titles met). Before that the competition was uninterrupted between 1992 and 1998. Title-holders from 1999, 2000 and 2001 did not play for this title.

John of Béthune (died 1219)

Jean de Béthune (died 1219), a member of the noble House of Bethune, was a French cleric who became the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese of Cambrai and ruler of the principality of Cambrésis in the Holy Roman Empire.
Origins.
Born around 1160, presumably at Béthune, he was a younger son of Robert V de Béthune (died 1191), hereditary Lord of Béthune and Advocate of the Abbey of Saint Vaast at Arras, and his wife Alice, daughter of Hugh III, Count of Saint-Pol. His brothers included: 
Early life.
Destined for a church career, by 1182 he was provost of the church of St Amé at Douai. An appointment to the church of St Piat at Seclin was however contested by Matilda of Portugal, widow of Philip I, Count of Flanders, who complained to Pope Innocent III. Innocent put the question to a panel of arbitrators and they in the end accepted Jean.
With his brother Baldwin, he was a supporter of Richard Lionheart and in 1198 was part of the English delegation to Cologne for the election and coronation of Richard's nephew and foster son Otto of Brunswick as King of the Romans.
Bishop of Cambrai.
For this, Otto nominated him to the bishopric of Cambrai in December 1200. He went to Cologne to seek investiture of the regalities from Otto, who granted them in September 1201.In Otto's ensuing conflicts with the Hohenstaufens, he was a loyal supporter.
In 1208 he was a potential candidate to become Archbishop of Cologne, one of the three most important sees in Germany, but objections were raised because he spoke no German (which suggests that he spoke only French, Latin and maybe Flemish). In 1209, as a prince of the Empire, he accompanied Otto to Rome for his coronation in St Peter's Basilica as Holy Roman Emperor.
At Cambrai, his position was complex. As bishop, he presided over an extensive diocese which covered a large part of present-day Belgium, including important cities like Brussels and stretching as far north as Antwerp. He was also secular lord of the town of Cambrai and prince of the independent principality of Cambrésis, which surrounded the city and formed part of the Holy Roman Empire. Relations between the bishops and the inhabitants of the town of Cambrai had often been tense, and in 1212 the townspeople obtained a charter from Otto's rival, Frederick, King of Sicily, granting them rights and privileges which curtailed the power of the bishop and the church.
The defeat of Otto and his allies at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214 meant that from then on the major power in the region was France, under the victorious King Philip II, while much of Germany recognised Frederick. Immediately after the battle, in which Philip had captured Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, Jean was one of three bishops asked by his wife Joan, Countess of Flanders, to negotiate the prisoner's ransom and release, but without success.
Jean was obliged to waive his loyalty to Otto and to accept the authority of Frederick, swearing him fidelity and obtaining a re-grant of the regalities from his hands. In 1215, Frederick granted Jean a new charter in which he recognised him as a prince of the Empire and as a kinsman.
In 1212, on the death of his brother Baldwin without a surviving son, he had inherited the lordship of Chocques near Béthune. Early in 1219, he joined the Albigensian Crusade, in which King Philip's son Louis led an army south and captured the town of Marmande in June, massacring its inhabitants. The force moved on to besiege Toulouse, which held out, and it was during this engagement that Jean fell ill and died on 27 July.
His body was taken back to his diocese and buried in front of the altar in the Cistercian abbey of Vaucelles.

Georgia Skovgaard

Georgia Maria Luise Skovgaard née Schouw (1828–1868) was a Danish embroiderer who is remembered above all for works depicting Danish flora, many of which were based on the artwork of her husband, the Golden Age painter P.C. Skovgaard. After her early death, her designs lived on after her student Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen used them to develop her own embroidery business.
Biography.
Born on 27 September 1828 in Copenhagen, Georgia Maria Luise Schouw was the daughter of the botanist and politician Joakim Frederik Schouw (1789–1852) and his wife Susanne Marie Augustine Peschier Dalgas (1798–1844). Brought up in a lively Grundtvegian home among visitors from the Danish world of culture, she was not given a formal education but acquired skills in drawing, painting and needlework from the artists who were friends of her parents. She perfected her skills after marrying the painter P.C. Skovgaard (1817–75) on 3 September 1851. It was N. F. S. Grundtvig himself who conducted the marriage ceremony at which the bride wore a veil with honeysuckle and wild flowers which she had embroidered herself from a design by Skovgaard.
The couple's artistic collaboration continued through their married life, frequently also inspired by artwork from their artist friends. Georgia Skovgaard sketched both classical monuments and naturalistic subjects while travelling in Italy with her husband in 1854–55. At the 1862 Scandinavian students meeting in Copenhagen, Skovgaard and her team sewed four banners as gifts for the various student associations. She instructed a number of other women in embroidery, first and foremost Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen who, after working for Skovgaard for a period, went on to open her own embroidery business together with Johanne Bindesbøll. It was Skovgaard who introduced the embroidery of Danish flora which was further developed at the beginning of the twentieth century by Gerda Bengtsson. Her husband also encouraged her to embroider depictions of animals including swans, dolphins, and deer which were often used in upholstery.
When only 39 years old, Georgia Skovgaard died in Copenhagen on 15 July 1868 while giving birth to a stillborn daughter. She is buried together with her husband in Copenhagen's Assistens Cemetery. Her patterns and designs continued to be used well into the 20th century by the embroiderers Konstantin-Hansen and Bindesbøll.
Exhibitions.
While Skovgaard's works were not exhibited during her lifetime, they featured at the 1895 Copenhagen Women's Exhibition and at the P.C. Skovgaard exhibition at the Kunstforeningen in 1917. More recently, they formed part of the P.C. Skovgaard exhibition at the Skovgaard Museum in Viborg (1967). Georgia Skovgaard was also represented in the embroidery exhibitions at the Danish Museum of Art &amp; Design in 1983 and 1990.
Family.
Skovgaard was the mother of three artists: Joakim Skovgaard (1856–1933), Niels Skovgaard (1858–1938) and Suzette Holten (1863–1937). Today there is a museum dedicated to the Skovgaard family.

Gargoyle (monster)

The gargoyle is a fantasy and horror monster inspired by the gargoyle architectural element. While they were believed in mythology to frighten away evil spirits, the idea of such statues physically coming to life is a more recent notion. Like golems, they are usually made of magically animated or transformed stone, but have animal or chimera traits and are often guardians of a place such as a cathedral or castle. They can also be depicted as vessels for demonic possession or as a living species resembling statues.
Description.
As evil constructs.
The notion of gargoyles as supernatural constructs brought to life by evil was introduced in "Maker of Gargoyles" (1932), a short pulp fiction story by Clark Ashton Smith where Reynard, a medieval stonemason, unconsciously infuses his hate and lust into two gargoyles that attack the town of Vyones and later kill him when he attempts to destroy them.
In the novelette "Conjure Wife" (1943) by Fritz Lieber, a dragon sculpture is animated by a witch and sent to kill an archaeology professor.
Such gargoyles also entered science fiction, such as in the "Doctor Who" episode "The Daemons" (1971).
As demonic vessels.
The notion of gargoyles as demonic vessels was introduced in "The Horn of Vapula" (Lewis Spence, 1932), in which a demon familiar is bound into a horned and goatlike gargoyle.
Gargoyles appear as horned canine statues in the movie "Ghostbusters" (1984), where they are possessed by the demonic spirits of Zuul and Vinz Klortho.
Gargoyles may also appear as vessels for formerly human souls, such as the Marvel Comics hero Gargoyle, who later is able to transform back into a human.
As a race of beings resembling statues.
The 1908 children's book "Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz" featured a Land of the Gargoyles, wooden creatures with hinged wings.
The film "Gargoyles" (1972) depicted a fictional race created by Satan to harry mankind.
A species of gargoyles also exists in "Dungeons &amp; Dragons".
Movies featuring races of gargoyle-like creatures include "Gargoyle" (2004) and "Rise of the Gargoyles" (2009), in which the creatures can lay eggs and turn into statues to blend in.
Friendly gargoyles.
The notion of a friendly gargoyle was used by the Disney show "Gargoyles" (1994–1997) in which gargoyles battle monsters to protect humanity. It originates from the folk belief of gargoyles as protectors. Friendly gargoyles also appear in the "Discworld" universe, such as Constable Downspout in "Feet of Clay" (1996), and in Disney's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1996), as Hugo, Victor and Laverne, who embody Quasimodo's subconscious.
In popular culture.
Gargoyles have occupied a prominent place in film, television, and gaming due to their distinctive characteristics.
Film and television.
"Gargoyles" is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television and distributed by Buena Vista Television, and originally aired from October 24, 1994, to February 15, 1997. The series features a species of nocturnal creatures known as gargoyles that turn to stone during the day. After spending a thousand years in an enchanted petrified state, the gargoyles (who have been transported from medieval Scotland) are reawakened in modern-day New York City, and take on roles as the city's secret night-time protectors. "Gargoyles" was noted for its relatively dark tone, complex story arcs, and melodrama; character arcs were heavily employed throughout the series, as were Shakespearean themes. The series also received favorable comparisons to "". A video game adaptation and a spin-off comic series were released in 1995. The show's storyline continued from 2006 to 2009 in a comic book series of the same title, produced by Slave Labor Graphics. IGN ranked "Gargoyles" 45th place on its 2009 list of top 100 animated series, stating: "A decent success at the time, "Gargoyles" has maintained a strong cult following since it ended more than a decade ago". Hollywood.com featured it on their 2010 list of six cartoons that should be movies. UGO.com included it on their 2011 top list of legendary medieval and fantasy TV shows.
The third season of the TV series "Riverdale" features a monstrous antagonist known as the "Gargoyle King."
Comics.
Gargoyle is a name shared by two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first Gargoyle, Yuri Topolov, appears in "The Incredible Hulk" #1 (May 1962), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The first Gargoyle received an entry in the "Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition" #17, where his real name was revealed. The second Gargoyle, Isaac Christians, is a human/demon composite and a member of the Defenders. He was created by writer J. M. DeMatteis and artist Don Perlin. Perlin's design was inspired by a sequence in "Prince Valiant" in which the titular hero disguises himself as a gargoyle. During his long run on "The Defenders", Gargoyle also was the co-star of "Marvel Team-Up" #119, written by his co-creator DeMatteis, who later described the issue as "one of my favorite "favorite" stories". In 1985 Marvel published a four-issue "Gargoyle" limited series, written by DeMatteis and drawn by Mark Badger. DeMatteis said of the series, "It was a psychological fantasy. You take the interior life and make it concrete... give it substance... and play with it."
Gaming.
"D &amp; D".
In the "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, a gargoyle is a grotesque winged monstrous humanoid creature, with a horned head and a stony hide. The gargoyle was one of the first monsters introduced in the earliest edition of the game, in the "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" "white box" set (1974), where they were described as a reptilian bipedal beast, Chaotic in alignment. The "kopoacinth", an aquatic version of the gargoyle, first appeared in the 1975 "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" supplement, "Blackmoor" by Dave Arneson. The gargoyle appears in the first edition "Monster Manual" (1977), where it is described as a ferocious predator of a magical nature, found among ruins; it attacks anything it can detect. The "marlgoyle", a more horrid form of gargoyle, first appears in the module "Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth" (1982), and later appears in "Monster Manual II" (1983) as the margoyle.
This edition of the "D&amp;D" game included its own version of the gargoyle, in the "Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set" (1977, 1981, 1983). The gargoyle was also later featured in the "Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game" set (1991), the "Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia" (1991), and the "Classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game" set (1994). The gargoyle and margoyle also appear first in the Monstrous Compendium Volume Two (1989), and are reprinted in the "Monstrous Manual" (1993), along with the kapoacinth.
The Greyhawk campaign setting module "Gargoyle" (1989) featured the gargoyle (of the Tors). In "Gargoyle", set in the City of Greyhawk, the player characters are hired by a pair of gargoyles to find their stolen wings. The "grist" (true gargoyle) appeared in "Vale of the Mage" (1990). The "guardgoyle" for the Forgotten Realms setting appeared in the "Ruins of Zhentil Keep" boxed set (1995). Four variant gargoyles appeared in the "Dragon's Bestiary" column of "Dragon" #223 (November 1995), including the "archer", the "grandfather plaque", the "spouter", and the "stone lion". These creatures were reprinted in "Monstrous Compendium Annual Three" (1996).
The gargoyle and kapoacinth appear in the "Monster Manual" for the 3.0 edition (2000–2002), and in the revised "Monster Manual" for 3.5 edition (2003–2007). The guardgoyle returned in "" (2005). The gargoyle appears in the "Monster Manual" for the 4th edition (2008–2014), including the "nabassu gargoyle".
Ordinarily, gargoyles are stone statues carved into a demonic shape and imbued with life by magical means, akin to a golem. However, their descriptions in the official source materials are sometimes unprecise and even conflicting; in the 2nd edition "Monstrous Compendium", for instance, their stats summary lists their diet as carnivorous, while the description of their ecology explains that a gargoyle requires neither food or water to survive. In some "D&amp;D"-related works, gargoyles and their kin (see "Variants", below) are even erroneously depicted as biological creatures capable of natural reproduction. A gargoyle is usually chaotic evil. Gargoyles are sentient, cunning, and malevolent to the extreme. Their favorite sport is to capture intelligent beings and slowly torture them to death. Due to its stone body, a gargoyle has the ability to hold itself so still that it appears to be a statue. Standard gargoyles possess wings which give them flight capability.
The gargoyle is fully detailed in Paizo Publishing's book "Classic Horrors Revisited" (2009), on pages 16–21.\
Video games.
"" is an action-adventure game for the original Game Boy. Developed by Capcom, it was released on May 2, 1990, in Japan, then North America in July, and lastly Europe in 1991. The playable character Red Arremer (Firebrand in the U.S.) made his debut in the video game series "Ghosts 'n Goblins" as an antagonist character, of which this is a spin-off. "Gargoyle's Quest" was followed by the NES prequel "Gargoyle's Quest II" in 1992 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System sequel "Demon's Crest" in 1994. According to the fictional game lore, Firebrand is a gargoyle predestined to carry on the namesake and identity of the Red Blaze – the powerful force that fought back the Destroyers long before this game takes place. As his destiny foretold, Firebrand saves the Ghoul Realm from brutal conquest by traversing the Ghoul Realm, building his powers, and preparing to fight against the Destroyers' king, Breager, so as to ensure the protection of the Ghoul Realm once more. "Gargoyle's Quest" was warmly received by contemporary and later critics alike, and sold well enough to warrant a prequel on the NES only two years later. Gargoyles also appear in the 1997 first-person shooter Blood by Monolith Productions and take two forms, one of flesh and one of stone
The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appears in the "Lego Marvel's Avengers" video game.
A video game adaptation of the Disney TV series, "Gargoyles", was released in 1995.
The popular MMORPG “RuneScape” features gargoyles as a slayer creature.
Others.
Animatronic gargoyle statues are a popular Halloween or haunted attraction commodity.
In "Monster High", Rochelle Goyle is the daughter of the gargoyles.

Dosmoche

Dosmoche is a festival celebrated in Ladakh, India. It is celebrated in Leh, Likir and Diskit monasteries. It is the last festival of New Year Celebrations, other one is Losar. The two-day Dosmoche festival is a gazetted holiday for Leh district and Zanskar Sub Division. Dosmoche is also known as the "Festival of Scapegoat" and is one of Ladakh's most popular prayer festivals.
History.
Dosmoche was started by the rulers of Ladakh. The festival was started during kingdom of King Lhachen Gongdup/ Lha-chen-Dnos-grub (1295–1320). He fought two battles with invaders from Nyungti (Kullu of Himachal Pradesh) to inhibit the exterminatory forces of the battles. Sacred mask dances which is known as Cham dance are carried out in the courtyard of the old chapel. It is below the gates of the Leh Palace. Lamas are drawn from different monasteries from across Ladakh on a rotation basis for this festival.
Celebrations.
High pitched sound of gyaling with the periodic sound of the cymbals echoed off the bare rocky slopes with the rhythmic beats of the drum. Monks looks attractive in multicoloured robes and various masks which represent the forms of various deities including Buddha. They danced to the beats with colorful fluttering surge to ward off evil and welcome universal peace and happiness. mask dances is an essential part of Tantric tradition of Mahayana Buddhism.
At a one-kilometre stretch from Moti-Market to the other end of Leh Bazaar thousands of stalls are also famous in two-day long festival. Thousands of people in colourful dresses got together at Leh bazaar for games like tambola and lotteries and shopping.
Schedule.
Since Ladakh follows the Tibetan lunar calendar and Dosmoche festival comes on the twenty-eighth and twenty ninth and day of the twelfth month Tibetan calendar, every year the festival falls on a different date of the Gregorian calendar.

Aurora Eugenia Latapí

Aurora Eugenia Latapí (México, 1911-2000) was a Mexican photographer, and the first woman to enter the Club Fotográfico de México. Her work has been associated with an avant-garde language that drew apart from the Pictorialist tradition that was in vogue at the beginning of the 20th century, due to the capture of geometric forms, the presence of foreground elements, and the process of overprinting.
Artistic trajectory.
Aurora Eugenia Latapí was born in Mexico, in 1911.
In 1926, when she was fifteen years old, she returned from a trip in Europe with a camera that had been given to her by her mother, Aurora Estévez de Latapí. Three years later, she began her career as a photographer. In an interview published in "Alquimia" magazine in the year 2000, she explains she began taking photographs as a hobby: “I enjoyed taking pictures, and since my mother liked it, I took them.” For this reason, she started studying photography at the American Photo Supply Co and at the industrial school Malina Xóchit. A few years later, she was admitted at the Academy of San Carlos, where she studied with the renowned Mexican photographer Agustín Jiménez.
In December 1929 she participated in the group show "Guillermo Toussaint y 11 fotógrafos mexicanos en la Galería de Arte Mexicano" at the National Theater (now Palacio de Bellas Artes) in Mexico City. The exhibit was organized by Carlos Mérida and Carlos Orozco Romero, and it featured works by sculptor Guillermo Toussaint, photographers Manuel Álvarez Bravo, Hugo Brehme, Rafael García, Librado García Smart, Agustín Jiménez, Ricardo Mantel, Luis Márquez, Juan Ocón and Roberto Turnbull, as well as Aurora Eugenia and her mother Aurora Latapí. Criticism of the show was positive and, according to José Antonio Rodríguez, this exhibition allowed Latapí to formally enter the Mexican photography scene, which was still ruled by the already weak Pictorialist style.
In November 1931, during her first year at San Carlos, she showed 50 pictures in the "Exposición Fotográfica Jiménez-Latapí" at Galería Excélsior, along with Agustín Jiménez. Latapí exhibited "still lifes" portraying organic materials or industrial objects, which allowed her to experiment with different mechanical processes such as overprinting negatives, and which she would push toward abstraction. In this second exhibition, her work spoke an avant-garde language that reflected, according to José Antonio Rodríguez, a more “mature” approach toward photography.
On this occasion, the critics’ opinion was divided. On the one hand, Latapí's and Jiménez's works were praised by some for “accurately expressing the aesthetic inquiries of our time”. On the other hand, an anonymous review was printed in "Helios" magazine (published by the Asociación de Fotógrafos de México, where the most influential Pictorialist photographers of Mexico came together), in which both photographers were accused of imitating the work of Edward Weston and Tina Modotti. It was common then, for Mexico-based photographers, like Weston and Modotti, but also like Latapí, Agustín Jiménez, and Lola and Manuel Álvarez Bravo to capture aspects of Mexican culture and landscape, as well as valuing high contrasts and compositional rhythms in photography, so it was frequent to find these similarities in photos taken by many artists in Mexico during those years.
In December 1931, La Tolteca, a Mexican cement company, and the newspaper Excélsior, organized a painting, drawing and photography contest, around the topic of the recently built and inaugurated cement factory in Mexico City's area of Mixcoac. The winning works were to be exhibited at the National Theater in an exhibition called "La Tolteca". Aurora Eugenia Latapí was awarded fourth place with the picture "Chalchiuhtlanetzin" (the first place was won by Manuel Álvarez Bravo; Agustín Jiménez won second; and third was awarded to Lola Álvarez Bravo). Once again, the jury's decision, which Diego Rivera was part of, was widely criticized in "Helios" magazine by members of the Asociación de Fotógrafos de México.
Latapí's series “La Tolteca” (1931) presents different views of the cement factory. Many of the photos show architectural structures covered with cement: a great wall with attached cylinders, grids, chimneys, towers; all of which contrast with metallic scaffolds, staircases and pipes. This large industrial landscape, however, is deprived of human form so, when one of the untitled photos shows someone climbing a scaffold tower in front of an architectural structure with three concrete cylinders and doors in the lower part, it becomes exceptional. As in other photographs by Latapí, the framing in the pictures of this series is mostly diagonal, and the closely captured large structures tend to exceed the limits of the frame. In this sense, and also due to the contrast between shadows and highlights, these compositions tend toward geometric abstraction.
After this show, Latapí's work was featured in many magazines, like "Jueves de Excélsior, Revista de revistas" and "Nuestro México," but according to José Antonio Rodríguez, it disappeared from the public sphere my the mid-1930s. Emma Cecilia García Krinsky, nonetheless, points out that the photographs Latapí took between the 1930s and 40s were very important for avant-garde photography in Mexico.
In 1950, she was the first woman to become a member of the Club Fotográfico de México: “I was sent out to develop, to do anything because they didn’t think I could do photography. So I took my photos to the right person, they liked it, and came up with something that they should not have done, put my photos in different classes [categories], to top it off I won a price in all of them. That’s why the men, as I was the first woman to enter, made me see my luck”. By the end of that year, Latapí founded the Salón Femenil (the Women Salon) of the Club Fotográfico de México, of which she would later become president.
During the 1950s and 60s, Latapí opened the commercial photographic studio “Foto Cui” in the Polanco neighbourhood, in Mexico City.
In 1961 she received an honorable mention in the National Photography Contest “Así es México”, and in 1963 she had her last solo show in the same contest.
After that and due to her husband's business activity she moved to the United States, but later returned to Mexico City where she died September 4, 2000.
Work.
In most of her photographs, Latapí used diagonal frames that make the captured objects and buildings exit the compositional space. The general composition of most of her photos is guided by strong, multiple and/or parallel diagonal axis that, along with shadows and highlights, provide the pictures with movement and depth. Diagonal frames, "close-ups", rhythm and contrasts between shadows and highlights, also create geometric patterns that render some of the images abstract.
Her preferred technique was gelatin silver. In her photos, objects like corncobs and zucchini, Mexican toys like "trompos" and "maracas", palm woven objects, or industrial buildings, among others, become the main subject. Textures and contrasts between them is also important: the detail of a corn leaf embracing the grains of its cob ("Mazorcas" or "Elotes", 1931); the smooth wooden finish of "maracas" on top of a palm woven "petate" ("Guajes", ca. 1940); or the skin of a hand holding a large metallic nail ("Obrero", 1931).
Many of her works are untitled, but some of the most representative titles are:

Typically, types of permissions cover functions that may have privacy implications, such as the ability to access a device's hardware features (including the camera and microphone), and personal data (such as device storage, the contacts list, and the user's present geographical location). Permissions are typically declared in an application's manifest, and certain permissions must be specifically granted at runtime by the user—who may revoke the permission at any time.
Permission systems are common on mobile operating systems, where permissions needed by specific apps must be disclosed via the platform's app store.
Mobile devices.
On mobile operating systems for smartphones and tablets, typical types of permissions regulate:
Prior to Android 6.0 "Marshmallow", permissions were automatically granted to apps at runtime, and they were presented upon installation in Google Play Store. Since Marshmallow, certain permissions now require the app to request permission at runtime by the user. These permissions may also be revoked at any time via Android's settings menu. Usage of permissions on Android are sometimes abused by app developers to gather personal information and deliver advertising; in particular, apps for using a phone's camera flash as a flashlight (which have grown largely redundant due to the integration of such functionality at the system level on later versions of Android) have been known to require a large array of unnecessary permissions beyond what is actually needed for the stated functionality.
iOS imposes a similar requirement for permissions to be granted at runtime, with particular controls offered for enabling of Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and location tracking.
WebPermissions.
WebPermissions is a permission system for web browsers. When a web application needs some data behind a permission, it must request it first. When it does it, a user sees a window asking him to make a choice. The choice is remembered, but can be cleared lately.
Currently the following resources are controlled:
Analysis.
The permission-based access control model assigns access privileges for certain data objects to apps. This is a derivate of the discretionary access control model. The access permissions are usually granted in the context of a specific user on a specific device. Permissions are granted permanently with few automatic restrictions.
In some cases permissions are implemented in 'all-or-nothing' approach: a user either has to grant all the requested permissions to an app, or be unable to use the app. It remains intransparent to the user when the permission is used by a program or app to access the data protected by the permission access control mechanism. Even if a user can revoke a permission, the app can blackmail a user by refusing to operate, for example by just crashing.
The permission mechanism has been widely criticized by researchers for several reasons, including;
There are some solutions, such as XPrivacy, which instead of providing access to the requested data instead of throwing an exception and crashing an app returning disinformation to make an app operate as if the permission was granted. Mockdroid is another instance of this approach. It is also possible to use static analysis to analyze the requested permissions. Further transparency methods include longitudinal behavioural profiling and multiple-source privacy analysis of app data access.

Battle of Bolkhov

In the Battle of Bolkhov on May 10–11, 1608, the troops of False Dmitry II managed to defeat the army of Tsar Vasily Shuisky.
Prelude.
From the Tsar's side at least 30 thousand soldiers (5 regiments) were assembled, Streltsy, Cossacks, noble cavalry and German mercenaries (from Livonia), under voevody Dmitry Shuisky and Vasily Golitsyn. On the side of the Pretender was only 13 thousand soldiers under the leadership of Lithuanian Prince Roman Rozhinsky, including almost 6.000 Polish-Lithuanian mercenaries.
Battle.
On the first day of battle, the Pretender's cavalry attacked first, consisting of heavy Hussars and Cossack cavalry. The attack was successfully repulsed by the Russian nobleman's cavalry and German mercenaries.
The next day, the frontal attacks of the Polish-Cossack forces were not successful because the Russian leaders placed their troops in a fortified camp. However, a deserter informed the hetman Rozhinsky of the strength of the Russian army, the location of the regiments, and also their unwillingness to fight for Tsar Vasily IV. Rozhinsky moved his reserves into the flank of the Russian army and resorted to cunning, ordering the inclusion of carts in this detachment, putting the battle banners on them, so that Russian soldiers would think that the army of False Dmitri was much larger. This caused confusion in the ranks of government troops, and their front crumbled under attack. The defeated army of Dmitry Shuisky fled.
Aftermath.
Part of the government troops (about 5 thousand) was besieged in Bolkhov, but after artillery bombardment surrendered and, recognizing the impostor as their sovereign, joined his army. False Dmitry II had the opportunity to attack Moscow. Kaluga recognized his power without a fight. The army of False Dmitry II came to Moscow and settled in the Tushino camp.

<doc id="56739840" url="?curid=56739840" title="Mr Jinks">
Mr Jinks

Mr Jinks (1926 – 1952) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was one of the best two-year-olds in England in 1928 when he won five of his seven races including the New Stakes, July Stakes, Lavant Stakes and Prendergast Stakes. In the following spring he took the Severals Stakes before recording his biggest success in the 2000 Guineas. He failed when favourite for the Epsom Derby but returned to form to win the St James's Palace Stakes. His performances subsequently deteriorated and he was retired from racing at the end of the year. He made little impact as a breeding stallion.
Background.
Mr Jinks was a "massive" grey horse with "big, spreading feet" bred in Northern Ireland by Dermot McCalmont who owned the horse during his racing career. He was trained by McCalmont's cousin Henry Seymour "Atty" Persse at Chattis Hill near Stockbridge in Hampshire. As a three-year-old Mr Jinks stood 16 hands high with a girth of 73 inches.
Mr Jinks inherited his grey colour from his sire Tetratema, the leading British two-year-old of 1919 who went on to win the 2000 Guineas and many important sprint races. As a breeding stallion, Tetratema sired many good sprinters and milers including Tiffin and Myrobella and was the British champion sire in 1929. Mr Jinks' dam False Piety was a granddaughter of Alicia, whose other female-line descendants included the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Golden Cloud.
Although a character named "Mr Jinks" appears in The Pickwick Papers, the horse was reportedly named after John Jinks, a former mayor of Sligo.
Racing career.
1928: two-year-old season.
Mr Jinks had acquired a considerable reputation before he ever appeared on a racecourse and when he made his debut in the New Stakes at Royal Ascot in June many "eager" spectators crowded the paddock to see the "powerful, strong-quartered, big-limbed colt." Ridden by Harry Beasley he duly took the race at odds of 9/4, recovering from a poor start to win "in the stle of an exceedingly useful colt" from Lord Astor's Cragadour. He was then sent to Sandown to contest the five furlong National Breeders' Produce Stakes, which at the time was the most valuable race of the season for two-year-olds, with prize money of over £7,000. He started joint-favourite but was beaten into second place by the filly Tiffin. In July at Newmarket Racecourse Mr Jinks returned to winning form when he won the July Stakes at odds of 4/11, beating the Coventry Stakes winner Reflector by half a length, and went on to win the Lavant Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in August by a short head from the filly Turbine, to whom he was conceding 10 pounds.
Mr Jinks came back in autumn to take the Prendergast Stakes at Newmarket at odds of 13/8 and finished second to Reflector in the Buckenham Post Produce Stakes. Mr Jinks ended his season by winning the Hurst Park Two-year-old Stakes in November.
He ended the season with earnings of £8,800 and was rated the joint-best juvenile colt of the season, equal with the Middle Park Stakes winner Costaki Pasha and a pound behind Tiffin.
1929: three-year-old season.
Mr Jinks began his second season by winning the Severals Stakes over five furlongs at Newmarket on 17 April. On 1 May, Mr Jinks, ridden by Beasley, started the 5/2 favourite for the 121st running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. The best fancied of the other 21 runners included Costaki Pasha, Gay Day, Cragadour and the Irish colt Trigo. The final stages saw the race evolve into a struggle between Mr Jinks and Cragadour, who were racing far apart on either side of the wide, straight course. Mr Jinks prevailed by a head from Cragadour, with Gay Day a length and a half away in third. After the race Beasley said "My horse was a bit lively at the post, but once away lie ran as smootha race as possible. I was about three lengths behind the leaders at the Bushes, and moved up to take the lead in the bottom of the Dip. After that I was not headed again".
Mr Jinks was then moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes (a trial race for the Epsom Derby) on 15 May. In a very close and "exciting" finish he was beaten a short head by Lord Derby's Hunter's Moon, with Midlothian in third place.
Despite his defeat in the Newmarket Stakes and doubts about his stamina, Mr Jinks started favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom on 5 June but began to struggle at half way and finished eleventh behind Trigo. Later that month at Royal Ascot the colt was dropped back in distance for the one-mile St James's Palace Stakes and won "very comfortaby" from seven opponents at odds of 6/4. After his win at Ascot, Mr Jinks began to be described as a "speed specialist". The colt was generally expected to follow up in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and started at odds of 4/7 but finished fourth behind Le Phare. In September Mr Jinks finished tailed-off in last behind Trigo in the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse.
Mr Jinks won one other minor race towards the end of the year and ended the season with earnings of £16,253, making him the second most financially successful racehorse of 1929.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Mr Jinks an "inferior" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
After his retirement from racing Mr Jinks stood as a breeding stallion. He made a fairly promising start to his stud career, but his later record was disappointing. He died in 1952 at the age of 26.

She was educated in the public schools, but without instruction in her special line, in which she continued to show development.
Career.
In 1879, she married John E. Mumaugh, of Omaha, Nebraska, where they afterward resided. She was soon identified with western art and artists.
 Broad in her ideas, she was not a follower of any particular school, and sought for herself nature's inspirations. Thrown on her own resources in 1885, with a two-year-old daughter to care for, worked diligently to be a recognized western artists. With the exception of a course of study in water-color under Jules Guérin, of Chicago, a summer course in oil with Dwight Frederick Boyden, of Paris, as well as a course with William Merritt Chase, her progress was due almost entirely to her own efforts. She delighted in landscapes, in which line she was always successful. She also designed holiday cards and gift tags for large firms, finding a big demand for them.
Mumaugh kept a studio in Omaha's Paxton block. As a teacher, her classes were always full. She conducted the art department in Long Pine Chautauqua for four years, and one season in Fremont, Nebraska. She served on the board of directors of the Western Art Association since its organization, in 1888.
Mumaugh died in 1933.

Elizabeth Angrnaqquaq

Elizabeth Angrnaqquaq (1916–2003) was an innovative Canadian Inuk textile artist active from the 1970s to early 2000s. Angnaqquaq's work explores textile creations while experimenting with non-traditional methods. Her style has been described as painterly for the way in which she fills the space between her figures and animals with embroidery.
Early life.
Angrnaqquaq was born in 1916 in the Northwest Territories, Canada in a traditional nomadic camp. She and her younger siblings were raised by their father after their mother died young. She lived a traditional Inuit lifestyle until the early she and her family moved to Baker Lake, Northwest Territories (now in Nunavut) in the 1950s to avoid poverty and starvation. Her son Harold worked at the sewing center in the late 1960s. In Baker Lake, Angrnaqquaq explored textile and mixed-media art practices where she used stitching as a method for creating figures in fabrics. Angrnaqquaq obtained fabrics through Jack and Sheila Butler, visiting art advisors to the Baker Lake region.
Career.
After establishing an art practice in which Angrnaqquaq explored figures of landscapes, animals, and textures through herringbone stitching, she began showing her works at Art Institutions around Canada. After establishing her art practice in textiles throughout Canada, Angenaqquaq was commissioned to create a public art commission for the Post Office at Wakefield, Ontario through the Public Works Department in 1976. Her work has been exhibited throughout North America, specifically in Toronto, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, and Winnipeg in both private and public commissions.
Angrnaqquaq worked well into her 80s, producing her last work in 2000. The work, entitled "Animals and People," explores bright colours and the situation of animal forms within an abstracted landscape. Animals and People was rendered in the same herringbone stitch which Angrnaqquaq was known for.
Angrnaqquaq died in 2003.

Parable of the Polygons

Parable of the Polygons is a 2014 explorable explanation created by Vi Hart and Nicky Case. The article focuses on a society of blue squares and yellow triangles which have slight personal biases against diversity, which leads to social segregation. It is based on game theorist Thomas Schelling's papers about residential segregation. The article was well-received, especially its visual and playable aspects, and was called a useful educational tool for topics like racial segregation.
Content.
The article is an interactive blog post, "part story and part game". It has a model consisting of a society of blue squares and yellow triangles, presented in a grid. At the top of the article, a crowd of triangles and squares are wiggling. Just under, it says, "This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world." The article first demonstrates step-by-step how institutional bias can occur even when there is little personal bias against diversity, and individuals are well-intentioned. The article describes the squares and triangles as "slightly shapist". In the first example, a square or triangle is happy only if at least a third of its neighbors are of the same shape as it is. The shapes prefer a diverse neighborhood, adopting a meh face in a homogeneous neighborhood. 
At this point, the article lets the reader interact with the model. The reader's goal is to make all residents happy with where they live, by moving only unhappy shapes. At first, the bias is easily managed; however, as the population grows, the shapes' bias quickly leads to visually segregated areas. The article reads: "Sometimes a neighborhood just becomes square, and it's not their fault if no triangles wanna stick around. And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square, but they can't help it if squares ain't interested." 
The reader can later execute automated simulations, and increase and decrease the shapes' bias. When the bias is increased, the segregation is more prominent. A subsequent iteration of the game shows that decreasing bias does not make a difference if the population started out segregated. Shapes then have to reject the default scenario of segregation in favor of seeking out the other shapes. Finally, the reader can generate new models using a sandbox. 
The article departs from Schelling's work by discussing a demand for "even the smallest bit of diversity" which reverses residential segregation; Case said that the article teaches that such segregation is "easily offset" with a "small amount of anti-bias", even if bias is still present. The article also departs from Schelling by concluding with encouraging words on how to enact change. The article concludes with: "If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life – that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors."
Development and release.
Vi Hart and Nicky Case, creator of "Coming Out Simulator 2014", teamed up following a talk on the lack of tech event diversity and women in STEM delivered by Hart, which convinced Case "of the necessity of active measures". The article applies ideas from game theorist and economist Thomas Schelling's 1971 paper "Dynamic Models of Segregation". 
Case described Schelling's model as "perfect – simple and fun to play"; Schelling played his own model on a chess board or graph paper with nickels and dimes, moving them one by one. Case said that they were "fascinated with taking models/systems from the arts [and] humanities, and translating them into game models/systems". The second part of the article was based on a "new surprising aspect of Schelling's model", which introduced a nonconformity bias. Case said that by playing around with variables, they found that "just as a "small" bias can turn a society segregated, a "small" anti-bias can reverse that". Hart said they knew that nonconformity would mix up the population, but that they were "pleasantly surprised to see it work even [at a] very minimum level". Case said that the article ends on an "optimistic note" that "small local changes really can change institutions from the bottom-up". Development of the article began in September 2014.
The goal of "Parable of the Polygons" was for readers to "learn to demand diversity". People are represented by abstract shapes because marking their races and genders would be "really weird" and "have the unfortunate implication that [the races and genders] are binary and immutable". A triangle was chosen because it appears in Hart's videos. The article contains few words, and the ability to move shapes is introduced "slowly and deliberately". Hart said that they felt that "it was important to start with moving the shapes by hand, so that later when shapes move automatically [the reader would know] there's nothing going on behind [their] back". The article provides readers with interactive sections governed by simple rules to help them prove the counter-intuitive results to themselves. Case said that there was "an effort made to keep players from being scared off by the big stuff"; thus, the article includes jokes, slang, and "cute and friendly shapes". Hart said that they wanted to make sure to explain systemic bias without changing the readers' "minds". Case said that a main message was "[not to] take it personally" because "large collective bias can exist even with small individual bias".
The article was released in December 2014; Hart noted that "matters of systematic bias [were] even more topical [at the moment]", and Case said, "There's a huge gap between the racial proportions of the police force and the neighborhoods they're policing, that both reinforces and results from racial tensions." Case said that Schelling's models could be identified in that "a black officer [had led] the police force one night" amidst the Ferguson unrest. Hart described the reaction to the article as "more positive than anything [Hart's] ever done" and "almost disturbingly eerie". Case said: "It's been surprisingly positive and polite, especially for something that touches on a touchy subject!" Hart said that they planned to "tweak some stuff after release", but did not because the reception was "so overwhelmingly positive". Case said that the article was doing "shockingly well", so any fixes "might weaken or confuse the message" when applied.
The art and code of Parable of the Polygons was made open-source, being released under the Creative Commons Zero public domain license. A remixed version which includes a green pentagon was made the same year and is featured at the bottom of the article: Several playtesters suggested more than two groups for the later simulations, and the authors wanted to include the green pentagon in the source code and on the bottom of the page to reinforce that race or gender aren't binary, but didn't want to complicate the model. Several translations were also created based on the source code, and are linked on the main header of the post.
Reception.
The critical reception for the article was overwhelmingly positive. Joanna Rothkopf of "Salon" called the article "an adorable and eloquent primer on issues of segregation". "Columbia Journalism Review" Chava Gourarie described the article as "a cute, engaging, playable explanation". Aatish Bhatia of "Wired" described the design and characters as "charming" and "delightfully animated".
The playable aspect of the article received praise. "Kill Screen" Jess Joho wrote, ""Parable of the Polygons" asks you to tackle Schelling's concepts in a way only a game could." Bhatia called the article "a truly interactive way of communicating an idea". Jesse Singal of "The Cut" called the article "a really well-done use of the web".
Singal noted the article's parallels to human behavior. Bhatia said that the article delivers an "effective, lucid and very relevant" lesson on real-world segregation, race and equality. Laura Moss of "Mother Nature Network" said that it "accurately illustrates racially segregated neighborhoods", and noted that the article illustrates "Schelling's three major findings": the effect of slight individual bias, the starting game state and the reluctancy to become more diverse, and the necessity of intervention "in creating and maintaining diversity". Joho said that "demonstrating a difficult reality while still maintaining a sense of actionable hope" was the article's "greatest achievement by far".
"Gamasutra" Phill Cameron praised the article for using triangles and squares and effectively dissociating itself from "the prejudices of real life". Bhatia said that the article does not get "embroiled in a heated political debate". Joho wrote that the article is "careful not to throw blame around", and that it constantly emphasizes that personal biases might be "unexamined, unintentional, or even unconscious". "The Washington Post" Ana Swanson said that the call to action is a "powerful" message. "Polygon" Megan Farokhmanesh wrote, "Half game, half informational post, "Parable of the Polygons" wants to encourage people to talk about topics like racism and sexism in healthy, constructive ways."
Amanda Montañez wrote in a "Scientific American" blog that the shapes assume that "their individual preference for diversity is sufficient to propel their society toward integration", but that "the social system in which they operate prohibits it". Montañez said that "true progress requires a more active, dramatic shift than expected" and that, in the article, "the complacent squares and triangles must abandon their preconceptions about the nature of 'shapism' and adopt a new, activist stance on integration". Montañez compared the idea of using two-dimensional geometric shapes to represent people to the 1884 illustrated novella "Flatland" by Edwin Abbott Abbott.

France–Syria relations

Relations between France and Syria have a long, rich historical background. Syria was a French League of Nations Mandate for two decades following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, before the last French troops were evacuated from Syria and Syrian independence was officially recognized and diplomatic relations between France and the newly created Syrian state were established.
France had an embassy in Damascus (closed down March 2012) and a consulate general in Aleppo and Latakia. Syria has an embassy in Paris and consulates in Marseille and Pointe-à-Pitre.
Despite the historical links between Syria and France, relations have often been strained as a result of the unstable condition of the Middle East's politics and France's foreign policies. France, since August 2011, insists that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, must step down, and ever since, France has been backing the Syrian opposition. France was the first Western country to give recognition to the SOC on 13 November 2012.
History.
Franco-Syrian War.
Following the Arab Revolt which resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans in Syria, British troops led by General Edmund Allenby, entered the city of Damascus in 1918 accompanied by troops of the Arab Revolt led by Faisal, son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca, and an Arab government was established in Damascus in October 1918. Although the Arabs hoped, trusting earlier British promises, that the newly established state would include all the Arab lands stretching from northern Syria to Yemen, in accordance with the secret Sykes–Picot Agreement between Britain and France, only the interior regions of Syria were given to the Arab kingdom. On 8 October, French troops disembarked in Beirut and occupied the Lebanese coastal region. The French immediately dissolved the local Arab governments in the region, with France demanding full implementation of the Sykes–Picot Agreement, with Syria under its control.
On 14 July 1920, General Henri Gourard gave King Faisal the choice between submission or abdication. Faisal abdicated and fled. However, the minister of war, Youssef al-Azmeh, refused to comply. With little remaining troops of the Arab army, Bedouin soldiers and civilian volunteers, Azmeh composed an army and met the 12,000 strong French forces under General Mariano Goybet at the Battle of Maysaloun. The French won the battle and Azmeh died on the battlefield along with many of the Syrian troops, with the survivors defecting. Damascus was captured with little local resistance on 24 July 1920.
French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon.
On 1923, following the Franco-Syrian War France was assigned the League of Nations mandate of Syria and Lebanon, starting from 29 September.
The mandate region was subdivided into six states. The states of Damascus, Aleppo, Alawites, Jabal Druze, the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta, and the State of Greater Lebanon. The drawing of those states was based on the sectarian demographics on the ground in Syria and was meant to prevent any unified nationalist revolts. However, nearly all the Syrian sects were hostile to the French mandate and to the division it created.
Great Syrian Revolt.
On August 23, 1925, Druze leader Sultan Pasha al-Atrash officially declared revolution against French rule in Syria. Calling upon unification of all Syrian sects, ethnic communities and religions against French rule, he managed to enlist the aid of large sections of the population in the nationwide revolt which was led by many notable figures from all around Syria such as Hassan al-Kharrat, Nasib al-Bakri, Fawzi al-Qawuqji and Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar.
Although the revolt was initially declared on 23 August, fighting had begun with the Battle of al-Kafr on July 22, 1925, one month before that. Many battles would follow, resulting in rebel victories. Whatsoever, France sent thousands of troops to Syria and Lebanon from its African colonies, equipped with modern weapons, compared to the meager supplies of the rebels. The French to regained many cities, although fierce resistance against their rule lasted until the spring of 1927, when the revolution was suppressed with the shelling of Damascus. The French sentenced al-Atrash and other national leaders to death, but al-Atrash escaped with the rebels to Transjordan and was eventually pardoned, returning after the signing of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, met with a huge public reception.
Independence.
Although Syria and France had previously negotiated a treaty of independence in September 1936, the treaty never came into force because of the French Legislature's refusal to ratify it. Following the Fall of France in 1940 during World War II, Syria came under the control of Vichy France until the British and Free French occupied the country in the Syria-Lebanon campaign. Pressured from Syrian nationalists and the British forces, France evacuated their troops on 17 April 1946, which marked the creation of the new, independent Syrian republic.
Post-Independence.
Franco-Syrian relations remained well following the independence, marked with a historical background and shared cultural relations.
In June 2000, following the death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, French President Jacques Chirac attended his funeral, being the only western head of state to do so. Whatsoever, following the death of Rafiq al-Hariri, which Chirac blamed on Syria, Syria was isolated diplomatically by France.
Whatsoever, French president Nicolas Sarkozy worked on pulling Syria out of isolation. He proposed for Syria to join the Union for the Mediterranean, with most EU countries complying and Syria joining the union, with Sarkozy later visiting Damascus and meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, making him the only western head of state to visit Syria following the assassination of Rafiq Hariri, blamed on Syria by western nations.
On 13 July 2008, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad visited Paris, meeting with President Sarkozy and attending the July 14 parade as a guest of honor.
Syrian Civil War.
Following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, France has called for President Bashar al-Assad to step down from power, and has provided opposition forces with non-lethal military aid, including communications equipment and medical supplies following the escalation of the armed conflict in 2012.
In August 2013, when the Syrian government was accused of using chemical weapons in the Ghouta area near Damascus, Paris called for military intervention but was isolated after the US president, Barack Obama, refused to act. Despite France not being involved militarily in the early phases of the conflict, in August 2014 French President François Hollande confirmed that France had delivered arms to Syrian rebels.
After the emergence of ISIL, France began conducting airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria, and in mid-November 2015, in the wake of the 13 November Paris terror attacks, France, citing self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, significantly intensified its air strikes in Syria, closely coordinating with the U.S. military.
Also mid November, France drafted a UN Security Council resolution urging UN members to "take all necessary measures" in the fight against Islamic State and al-Nusra Front.
The following day the French-drafted resolution was co-sponsored by the UK. 
On 20 November 2015, the UN Security Council unanimously passed the French-British drafted-sponsored resolution.
Also on 20 November, France dismissed Russia's suggestions that the French air strikes against oil installations in Syria were illegal, saying they were "an appropriate and necessary riposte" to attacks by Islamic State.
On 14 April 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement that France's "red line has been crossed", in reference to the previous attacks on Douma. Beginning at 04:00 Syrian time (UTC+3), France, the United States, and the United Kingdom carried out a series of military strikes involving aircraft and ship-based missiles against multiple government sites in Syria. They said it was in response to the Douma chemical attack against civilians on 7 April, which they attributed to the Syrian government. The Syrian government denied involvement in the Douma attacks and called the airstrikes a violation of international law. On 20 April, the Syrian government returned the Légion d'honneur award that was given to President Bashar al-Assad by France in 2001, stating that he would not wear the award of a “slave country” to the US. Following the French participation in US led airstrikes on Damascus and Homs and France "disciplinary procedure" for withdrawing the award.

He contributed theatre reviews to the "Courrier de Lyon" and wrote for the "Journal du Rhône", directed by his father.
In 1849 he became a magistrate as substitute for the Court of First Instance of Lyon.
On 2 June 1851 Grandperret married Alexandrine Emanuelle Félicie Martin (1826–1872) at Saint-Jean-le-Vieux, Ain.

He served in the Massachusetts Senate from 1917 to 1918. He returned to the House in 1919 and 1920 and again from 1923 to 1927.
From 1926 to 1939, Fitzgerald represented Ward 3 on the Boston City Council. He served as the council president from 1935 to 1937. He was defeated for reelection to the council by Joseph Russo. In 1941 he finished 5th in a Boston School Committee race where the top two candidates were elected. He ran for his old council seat in 1943, but lost to Russo 47% to 26%. In 1945, Fitzgerald was appointed Boston Fire Commissioner by acting mayor John E. Kerrigan.
In 1948, Fitzgerald ran for the United States Senate seat held by Leverett Saltonstall. He won the Democratic primary over four other candidates with 30% of the vote. Fitzgerald nearly pulled off an upset, but lost the general election to Saltonstall 53% to 46%. Fitzgerald ran again in 1954, but finished third in the primary behind Foster Furcolo and Joseph L. Murphy.
Later life and death.
In November 1966, Fitzgerald gave up operating his parking lot near North Station. He was later confined him to his home after he fell and broken his arm. At midnight on December 16, 1966, Fitzgerald died of a heart attack at his home in the West End.

François Couturier

François Couturier (born 2 May 1950 in Fleury-les-Aubrais, Orléans) is a French jazz pianist.
Biography.
Couturier began learning piano at the age of six. A year after earning his degree in classical piano and musicology in 1977, he met Jacques Thollot's quartet bassist Jean-Paul Céléa, with whom he formed a duo. Between 1981 and 1983, Couturier toured with John McLaughlin, with whom he also recorded. Over time, he played with French jazz musicians such as André Ceccarelli, Eddy Louiss, Michel Portal, François Jeanneau and with Daniel Humair. After first meeting during the 1985 edition of the Festival de Carthage, Couturier collaborated on Tunisian oud player Anouar Brahem's albums "Khomsa" (1994), "Le pas du Chat Noir" (2001) and "Le Voyage de Sahar" (2005), and the two have toured together several times since 2001.
In 2006, his album "Nostalghia – A Song for Tarkovsky" was released on the label ECM Records alongside soprano saxophonist Jean-Marc Larché, accordionist Jean-Louis Matinier and cellist Anja Lechner. The album is dedicated to the film director Andrei Tarkovsky and his films. The album's music was also presented at various festivals, first in Bergamo in 2006. Other albums with the "Tarkovsky Quartet" followed in 2011 and 2017. In 2007, he played in the quintet "Passaggio", with which he recorded two albums on Label Bleu, and in the "European Jazz Trio" with Céléa and Wolfgang Reisinger. He also plays in duo with the violinist Dominique Pifarély on his album "Poros" (1997) and with the pianist Jean-Pierre Chalet. With the countertenor Dominique Visse he recorded "From Machaut to Berio".

Its type section is located in the Spray River gorge at the southern end of Sulphur Mountain.
The Spray River Group includes marine fossils from the Triassic period.
Stratigraphy and lithology.
The Spray River Group was deposited on the continental shelf along the western margin of the North American craton. It is subdivided into two formations: the Sulphur Mountain Formation at the base and the Whitehorse Formation at the top.
The Sulphur Mountain Formation consists of dolomitic and calcitic siltstones, silty dolomites, dolomitic limestones, and very fine-grained dolomitic quartz sandstones. The Whitehorse Formation consists of dolomites, dolomitic siltstones and limestones, and dolomitic and calcitic quartzites.

Sad!

"Sad!" (stylized in all-caps) is a song by American rapper XXXTentacion from his second studio album, "?" (2018). It was released as the lead single from the album on March 2, 2018. The track was produced by John Cunningham, and written by XXXTentacion. The song is XXXTentacion's highest charting in the United States, peaking at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 following his death on June 18, 2018. The song has also amassed more than 1.5 billion streams on Spotify, being one of the most streamed songs on the platform. The song remains X's biggest hit single to date.
A music video for the song was released on June 28, via his YouTube channel. On August 13, 2021, the single was certified Diamond by the RIAA in the US, making it the best-selling emo rap song of all-time.
Background.
XXXTentacion began working with the producer for "SAD!", John Cunningham, in January 2018 after a preview of an acoustic song was uploaded to X's Instagram page showing Cunningham playing the guitar whilst X sung. On January 11, 2018, X uploaded a gaming video to his YouTube channel showing him playing the popular video game, "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds". The intro to the video was a preview for "SAD!" and X further previewed the song a month later in a video on February 4, 2018, using it for his intro, after speculation the song was titled "SAD n Low" following a mass amount of snippets uploaded to YouTube. X went on to preview the song one more time in a YouTube video before its official release a few days later.
Release and reception.
On March 1, 2018, X announced he was releasing two songs from his upcoming album "?", saying on Instagram "Dropping two songs from my album tonight at 12:00 am est, play them more times than you can count." "SAD!" was released on March 2, 2018, on Spotify, Deezer, iTunes/Apple Music and Tidal alongside "Changes".&lt;
"HotNewHipHop" compared "SAD!" to the singles on X's debut album, "17" due to its emo hip hop aesthetic, saying "Once again, the young Floridian is veering into emo territory — with a lo-fi synth string loop and crisp percussion, the melodic ballad showcases X's ear for melody." XXL noted how the "upbeat instrumental" varied from the lyrics that shown XXX "struggling with depression and suicide over an ex-lover." "Rap-Up" also pointed out the "emo-melodies" that surround the track and spoke on the theme of suicidal thoughts over an ill-fated romance. The song has also amassed more than 1.5 billion streams on Spotify, being one of the most streamed songs on the platform.
On May 10, 2018, "Billboard" reported that the song was removed from Spotify playlists after their newly enacted hate content and hateful conduct policy came into effect. Six days after the playlist removal, the song's streams dropped 17 percent per day in the United States on average.
Chart performance.
In the United States, "SAD!" debuted at number 17 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in the week beginning March 12, 2018, becoming XXXTentacion's highest debuting and highest-charting song in the country, gaining 66 million streams in 12 days. The song later rose to number seven, making "SAD!" XXXTentacion's first top ten entry in the US.
In the United Kingdom, "SAD!" was at number 33 by the midweek, becoming X's highest-charting song in the country next to "Jocelyn Flores", which peaked at 39, and his second top 40 entry. The song officially debuted at number 26, becoming XXXTentacion's first top 30 hit in the country. "SAD!" reached the top 10 in Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand. It also reached the top 20 in Ireland, and the top 40 in Norway.
"SAD!" amassed 10.4 million streams on Spotify on June 19, 2018, the day after his death, breaking the single-day record for streams on the platform.
Following XXXTentacion's death, "SAD!" reached number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 on the week beginning June 25, 2018, jumping from number 52, making him the first act to earn a posthumous Hot 100 number-one single as a lead artist since The Notorious B.I.G. with "Mo Money Mo Problems" in 1997, and overall, the ninth artist to have topped the chart posthumously. It also reached number 12 in the Netherlands. "SAD!" official audio reached one billion YouTube views on January 14, 2021.
Music video.
The music video for Onfroy's "SAD!" premiered one day after his memorial service at the BB&amp;T Center on June 28, 2018. The video was written and "creative directed" by Onfroy himself, and directed by JMP. In the video, an older X attends the funeral of his younger self. When X approaches the casket to look at his younger self, the younger X suddenly returns to life. The two begin fighting in the church and out in the alley. Before, during, and after the fight, a dark figure speaks to X, asking various questions and advocating for a way of thinking centered on love rather than hate. X defeats his younger self and leaves him lying on the ground in a completely white location. The video concludes with the words "LONG LIVE PRINCE X". The video has over 148 million views across YouTube as of August 2021.

Stick in the Wheel

Stick in the Wheel are a band with its origins in working-class East London, UK. It consists of vocalist and artist Nicola Kearey and Ian Carter, their producer, arranger and Dobro player. They bring a contemporary approach to folk music with raw minimalism, setting vocals to simple accompaniments and handclaps, along with progressive synths and beats informed by the street music of their heritage. They sing and perform both their own compositions and traditional songs, which hold a strong relationship to each other through their subject matter.
History.
Stick in the Wheel was formed by Ian Carter, Nicola Kearey and Rachel Thomas Davies, who had previously worked together on other projects including the dubstep group Various.
EP1.
This was recorded partly in their kitchens; Nicola Kearey plays autoharp. In 2013, Rachel Thomas Davies moved to Wales, at which point Nicola Kearey took on all the main vocals and was joined by Fran Morter.
Cuts.
Their second EP, Cuts, contained four traditional tunes, originally recorded for Radio 2, FATEA and other folk radio shows/compilations. 'Barbara Allen' was recorded for the Radio 2 Folk Show’s Cecil Sharp Collection, 'The Cruel Ship’s Captain' was recorded for the Folk and Friends show on Radio Warwickshire, 'Champions at Keeping them Rolling' was recorded for the Winter 2013 FATEA Brushstrokes Sessions and 'Marrabones' was recorded for the Loughton Folk Club 2013 charity CD.
Bones.
The third EP, Bones, was released a few weeks later and featured Ian Carter, Nicola Kearey and Fran Morter with Joolie Wood on violin and additional vocals from Rachel Davies. Bones was recorded in a kitchen and above a North London tube station. Described by fROOTS as startling for the way familiar folk songs "are served back to us as urban field hollers". The CD won fROOTS Editor’s Choice Of 2014 for Album of the year and was described as "2014’s breath of fresh air".
Towards the end of the year the band recorded live sessions for Xfm and BBC6 Music, and at the beginning of 2015 they were nominated for the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in two categories: the Horizon Award for Best Emerging Act, and for Best Traditional Song (Bedlam).
From Here.
Their debut album, From Here, was released in September 2015 on their own record label, From Here Records. It features Ewan MacColl’s song 'Champion at Keeping Them Rolling', the traditional song The Blacksmith, and Copper Family’s Hard Times of Old England alongside new song Me N Becky, a story of the 2011 London riots, looting, remorse and jail. The Guardian Newspaper described it as 'A powerful and original debut'. Bright Young Folk concluded its review with the following "From Here collects songs of and for the downtrodden, with honest, caustic yet poetic lyrics of everyday life that take no prisoners, combined with often sparse but mesmerising music. By positioning traditional selections alongside new material, Stick in the Wheel show that for most people, little has changed over the last few hundred years". The album won the 2015 fRoots Critics Poll For Albums Of The Year for new albums. In 2016 they were nominated for the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in two categories: the Horizon Award for Best Group, and for Best Traditional Track (Seven Gypsies).
Stick In The Wheel Presents From Here: English Folk Field Recordings.
As a way of giving something back to the scene that had, if not completely accepted them, at least accommodated them, the group set out to make a collection of live recordings of other musicians immersed in traditional music; what they called a snapshot of English folk music right now. They wanted to capture performances that were immediate and intimate. They recorded across the country in private and personal spaces, in down-time, and between gigs. Often recorded in less than an hour in locations as diverse as a stone cottage in Edale, a London bank vault, a Bristol back room, to a Robin Hood's Bay garden at dusk and a Bedford kitchen. The theme of the project was "From Here" and each artist's contribution was their response to that theme. They were recorded live, with two stereo mics and no overdubs. Artists involved included Martin Carthy, Eliza Carthy, John Kirkpatrick, Jon Boden and Spiro (band). Caught By The River said: "The idea behind this bountiful record... is so ingenuously ambitious and artfully executed, it feels both like the beginning of a major project of contemporary musicology and plays like a dream open-mic session at the perfect folk club". The project was supported by funding from Arts Council England.
Follow Them True.
Stick in the Wheel's 2017 album was a return to a group format with a thematic album, described by the Guardian as "precision folk with anger, lust and blood ". Nicola Kearey said in an interview that they had the picture for the cover early on, and she wanted to write songs based on the picture. The album is about rituals and cycles, how people are condemned to make the same mistakes of the past. It was recorded over a number of weekends in a warehouse in Basildon, where Simon Foote worked. They recorded in the open plan office and used various rooms as booths and the stairwell for percussion. The exception was "As I Roved Out" which was recorded later; Nicola Kearey sang the vocal into her phone and Ian Carter built the track around it.

Hold Fast.
In July 2020 the duo released an animated video for their new single Villon Song from the upcoming album "Hold Fast". The lyrics of the song come from W E Henley's 1887 free translation of the 15th Century Francoise Villon's "Tout aux tavernes et aux filles" into thieves' cant. The album also explores cant songs from "Musa Pedestris" as well as fragments and maxims from the "Exeter Book. Hold Fast -" an album of "hope and resistance" "-" was released in August 2021, with BBC6Music's Marc Riley stating it was "one of the albums of the year", with continued support from Iggy Pop on his BBC6Music show. The band recruited Sian Monaghan and George Hoyle to play drums and bass for their only show of 2020, in December at Hackney's Round Chapel.

Charivari (store)

Charivari was a clothing store in New York City. Its first store opened in 1967, it grew to have six stores and finally closed in 1998. It is known for championing avant-garde fashion designers in the 1980s. Its rise to prominence in fashion coincided with the gentrification of its neighborhood, Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Background.
During the 1970s and 1980s the store grew from one to five locations (four were on the Upper West Side, there was a store on West 57 and a sixth location on the Upper East Side was added in 1992). The Upper West Side locations were designed by Alan J. Buchsbaum. The store championed Japanese and European designers, significantly contributing to the revolution in fashion that took place in the 1980s. Some of the designers featured at Charivari included Azzedine Alaïa, Giorgio Armani, Ann Demeulemeester, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Perry Ellis, Jean Paul Gaultier, Katharine Hamnett, Marc Jacobs (who, as a teenager, worked at Charivari), Helmut Lang, Issey Miyake, Thierry Mugler, Dries van Noten, Miuccia Prada, Gianni Versace, and Yohji Yamamoto. Writing about the closing of the chain in The New Yorker, Rebecca Mead noted: "If, during the nineteen-eighties, you wanted your clothes to indicate that you were a) in the know, fashionwise; b) a bit of an intellectual; and c) not afraid of wearing unfinished seams or jackets turned inside out, or other things that might, if not worn with sufficient élan, look like fashion disasters, then you shopped at Charivari."
Jon Weiser who, with his mother Selma and sister Barbara Weiser founded and ran the stores, attributed the company's decline and eventual failure to poor financial planning, the recession in the 1990s and its own success: the availability of the avant-garde designers championed by Charivari in both the designers' own stores and at larger department stores made a store like Charivari unnecessary.
Timeline.
In 1967, Upon the debut of Charivari, the Upper West Side received its first glimpse in high fashion. Charivari was a family business company founded by Selma Weiser and her daughter Barbara as well as her son Jon.
In 1976, With the relocation of the men's store across the street, Charivari's rising status as a cutting-edge pilgrimage was secured. Alan Buchsbaum, a minimalist architect became the designer of several Charivari's expansion. Also in 1976, Esquire magazine ran a feature about America's 8 top stores and Charivari was picked for New York.

Dermechinus

Dermechinus is a genus of sea urchin in the family Echinidae found in deep water in the southern Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is monotypic, with Dermechinus horridus, sometimes called the cactus urchin, being the only species.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1879 as "Echinus horridus" by the American zoologist Alexander Agassiz, after being dredged from the deep seabed during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876. In 1942, it was allocated to the newly erected genus "Dermechinus" by the Danish zoologist Ole Theodor Jensen Mortensen, a specialist in sea urchins.
Description.
An unusual-looking bright-orange sea urchin, "Dermechinus horridus" is globular when young but sometimes grows to a height more than twice its width. The fine long spines grow in vertical rows and are interspersed with a dense mat of shorter ones. Pedicellariae and tube feet are also present, and the general appearance of the sea urchin is similar to a cylindrical cactus.
Distribution.
"D. horridus" has a global but discontinuous distribution on the continental slope in oceans in the southern hemisphere; this includes Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The depth range of this sea urchin is .
Ecology.
This sea urchin tends to perch on rocks, in rows at right angles to the current, and has a relatively small mouth, leading to the speculation that it might be a filter feeder, an unusual feeding method among sea urchins. Commenting on this suggestion, sea urchin expert F. Julian Fell pointed out that "Dermechinus horridus" lived in zooplankton-rich waters and that its upright posture resembled that of a filter-feeding sea cucumber; the long spines formed combs and the short spines would be suitable for transporting small particles to the mouth at the base of the animal, with the tiny jaws adequate for ingesting them. So this feeding method is a possibility, but direct observation is needed.

TATA-box binding protein associated factor 7 like is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TAF7L gene.
Function.
This gene is similar to a mouse gene that encodes a TATA box binding protein-associated factor, and shows testis-specific expression. The encoded protein could be a spermatogenesis-specific component of the DNA-binding general transcription factor complex TFIID. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2009].

Serenade (poetry collection)

Serenade is a volume of poetry by Dutch poet J. Slauerhoff. First published in 1930, the poems in the collection are mostly personal and lyric poems. Critics have noted that some of the poems are inspired by 19th-century French poetry and are sexual in nature, and they have responded in various ways, with assessments ranging from "childish" to "pure lyric". The themes of desperation and the desire to escape bourgeois life, common in Slauerhoff's other poetry, are found in "Serenade" as well, and two of the poems were used in an obituary for the poet, who died eight years after the publication of this volume.
Content.
The collection comprises 27 poems of between 6 and 48 lines. Four of the poems form a tetralogy called "For the children", containing a creation myth, a poem in which the dead lovingly address children, a narrative poem about a child that fell from the stars, and a poem in which a child compares the stars to a herd of animals and questions why they do not wander.
Many of the poems discuss sexual love. P. N. van Eijck noted that compared to earlier poems by Slauerhoff the speaker seems to adopt a less antagonistic attitude toward the women addressed in the poems, and figures as a lover (albeit a powerless and unsatisfied one) rather than a desperate man who opposes everything on principle. Van Eijck notes the dependence of many of the poems (and that of his "Saturnus") on the French poetry of the 1850-1900 period, and considers their genesis to be mostly sexual.
Other readers focused on the sense of desperation, of never being at home, that is found in some of the poems; A. G. W. Severijnen cited from two poems in "Serenade" in an obituary on the occasion of Slauerhoff's death. In "De voorpost" ("The outpost") and "In mijn leven..." ("In my life"), Severijnen sees Slauerhoff's disgust with ordinary bourgeois life, the desire to escape the mundane and to wander the earth.
Publishing history.
First published in 1930 by The Halcyon Press of Maastricht and Brussels (with E. du Perron having corrected the manuscript), it was reprinted four times by A. A. M. Stols (Maastricht/The Hague, in 1938, 1942, 1946, and 1954), and twice by Emanuel Querido (Amsterdam, 1978 and 1982). It was published (unchanged from the first edition) in 1982 by Nijgh &amp; Van Ditmar as part of Slauerhoff's collected poetic works.
Critical responses.
Hendrik Marsman thought that on the whole "Serenade" was bad, full of trivial material, and written in a very pedestrian style—the best that could be said about a lot of the poems was that they were not awful. Particularly the fourth poem of the "For the children" cycle invoked his wrath; he thought it childish. Marsman also commented that he just could not get used to Slauerhoff's rhythm with its frequent syncopation, masculine rhymes, and monosyllabic phrases. The collection's bright side is a half a dozen poems which, according to Marsman, are Slauerhoff at his most powerful and personal.
E. du Perron responded directly to Marsman's commentary in a lengthy review of Slauerhoff's poetry. Du Perron sees no weak spots in the collection, liking even the poems that Marsman did away with as childish. He separates them in two categories—lighter and of higher tone, and heavier and more serious, and claims to not want to miss a single stanza of "Serenade". He noted "De Voorpost" and "In mijn leven..." as among the serious ones, the same poems Severijnen focused on in his obituary. Anton van Duinkerken also cites "Voorpost" as emblematic of Slauerhoff's life and desire.
Long after Slauerhoff's death, Victor E. van Vriesland revisited "Serenade" and Marsman's critique; van Vriesland argues that "Serenade" is the best Slauerhoff published before 1930, that he managed to overcome most of the "errors of his virtues". Those errors include capriciousness and a nonchalance intended to show his antipathy against the pose of literariness. In "Serenade", van Vriesland argues, Slauerhoff left behind the "anecdotal character" of his earlier work. He praises the collection for its "pure lyric" and its "refined technique" which still retained the unexpected and concise expression he had already demonstrated.

Rina Yerushalmi

Rina Yerushalmi (born March 1, 1939) is an Israeli theater director and choreographer. Yerushalmi received an honorary doctorate from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2001 and the Israel Prize in Theatre in 2008, among other awards and recognition.
Biography.
Yerushalmi was born March 1, 1939 in Afula, in northern Israel, and was raised in Haifa. Her mother, Haya (Angilovich) Yerushalmi, and father, Saul Yerushalmi (originally Yerusalimski), immigrated to Israel from Russia in 1920 and 1917, respectively. Her mother was a nurse, and her father was an engineer. Yerushalmi began studying dance at age six. At age 20, after her mandatory service in the Israeli Defense Force, Yerushalmi moved to London, where she studied Laban movement analysis with Kurt Jooss and stage management at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Back in Israel, Yerushalmi studied the Lee Strasberg method with Nola Chilton and the Feldenkrais method with Moshe Feldenkrais. Yerushalmi moved to the United States in the late 1960s to pursue her MFA in theater directing at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Early career (1970-1988).
Yerushalmi's final project at Carnegie Mellon, under the mentorship of Professor Leon Katz, was an adaptation of Buchner's Woyzeck. In 1970, after finishing her MFA, Yerushalmi moved to New York City and began working with Ellen Stewart's La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan. She was a resident director at La MaMA from 1972–1978. Yerushalmi directed a number of productions at La MaMa throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including: "Toy Show" (1970); "Ta, Ta, Tatata" (1970); "Shekhina: The Bride" (1971); "Some Such Things" (1978); "Glasshouse" (1980); and "Yossele Golem" (1982). She also choreographed and performed in "An Ecumenical Theatrical Liturgy on the Rights of the Child" (1979) and performed in "Shradanjali" (1982) at La MaMa.
During this time, she also founded a branch of La MaMa in Tel Aviv, which was active from 1972–1974.
Later career (1988-present).
In 1988, Yerushalmi directed a production of "Hamlet" at the Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre. Following this production, in 1989, Yerushalmi founded the Itim Theater Ensemble, for which she continues to serve as artistic director. The theater is dedicated to the performance of classical texts as contemporary theater.
Two of Yerushalmi's major productions with the Itim Theater Ensemble have been the Bible Project Parts I and II (1995-2000) and "Mythos" (2001/2002). The Bible Project consisted of "Va-Yomer, Va-Yelech" ("And He Said, And He Walked") and "Va-Yishtahu, Va-Yera" ("And They Bowed, And He Saw").
Yerushalmi currently teaches acting and directing at Tel Aviv University.

Im Che

Im Che (; 1549 – 1587) was a literate Confucianist Yangban in Joseon.
Works.
Im penned the following sijo upon the death of famed gisaeng, Hwang Jini.
The following two poems were exchanged between Im Che and his lover, gisaeng Hanu (한우; 寒雨). Im was known for his liaisons with Hanu and Hwang Jin Yi. The term in line 3, ch'an bi (찬비), literally translates as "freezing rain." It uses the same Chinese characters as the poetess' name (寒雨), but with a different pronunciation, and was intended by both poets as a pun. 
Hanu's particular gift is to echo the style of the original that Im wrote to her, while improving on it with a teasing, very human tone. The translation employs a formal tone to match Im's original; and then follows with the simpler and more lyric style used by Hanu. In both cases, the line "rain has frozen" seemed to best communicate the double entendre of the originals.
When about to die, he grieved and left the words below.
Kō Bun'yū introduce this line as Im Che's indignation because in the history, this is not only barbarians outside of the Great Wall, but even Tibetans from southwest conquered Chinese world once, or occupied the capital and threatened the city, however only Korea never even became a threaten to China. What Korea do is to treat Great China with the utmost courtesy and show loyalty to father.

George Cockshott

George Cockshott (7 May 1875 in Preston, Lancashire – 1953 in Hampshire) was born into a legal and sporting family in Southport, where he practised as a solicitor in the family firm of Bucks, Cockshott and Cockshott. His brother Francis was an Athletics Blue in each of his three years at Cambridge as well as working for a time in the family firm. George served as a justice of the peace and was also an active and gifted amateur yacht designer. His claim to fame comes through his design of the 'International' 12 Foot Dinghy. Although the international status of the class was revoked by the IYRU (now World Sailing) in 1964, it is still raced actively across the world. George retired to Hampshire in later years, dying there in 1953.
Early life.
George was educated at Uppingham School and King’s College Cambridge. As a boy he took a keen delight in building and sailing model yachts, and while at school built for himself a rowing and sailing boat. He joined the Cambridge University Cruising Club shortly after its formation in 1893. On coming down from Cambridge and commencing practice as a solicitor in the family firm, he spent several seasons as ‘forward hand’ racing in the Southport ¾-rating class and the Menai Straits 1-rating class. In 1906 he married Mary Eileen Beatrice Kent of Wicklow, Ireland (b 28 Nov 1985) and they had two sons.
Sailing and Yacht Design Activities.
George owned the "Unona", a half decked centre board boat, and designed and sailed for two seasons a boat in a ‘restricted class’ of 12-foot dinghies with a fair measure of success. In 1901 he became owner of the 12 ton cutter "Eurynome", a boat long famous as a cruiser-racer in Irish, Clyde and Welsh waters. Although Cockshott preferred cruising to racing and considerably reduced her spars and canvas, she was successfully raced under his flag for several seasons in a strong handicap class. In 1903 he won a trophy, engraved with the name of his boat - Eurynome. This trophy he later (1950) presented to the Cambridge University Cruising Club.
In 1904, he again entered the ¾-rating class as part owner of "Imp". He also owned the yacht "Sthoreen", an able and comfortable cruising yawl of 16 tons, built from his own designs, and launched in the spring of 1906. In addition to his own yacht "Sthoreen", Cockshott designed one 20 tonner, several smaller yachts and motor launches, and a tender to the Southport lifeboat, all of which were built to his designs. He also designed a new racing class for the West Lancashire Yacht Club in 1906 from which nine boats were built and are now known as the West Kirby Star Class. The five remaining Stars transferred to West Kirby SC in 1922, and the class there has been added to over the years.
'International' 12 Foot Dinghy.
In 1912 Cockshott won a design competition for a small sailing and rowing dinghy. The requirements for this dinghy were:
The hull was to be clinker, planked in spruce on bent timbers. Cockshott's design became known worldwide as the 'International' 12 Foot Dinghy. The design was granted informal international status in 1914 and full international status was confirmed by the IYRU (now World Sailing) in 1919.
In 1920 the 12 foot dinghy was used in the Summer Olympics as the first one design class. The dinghy was also used as an Olympic class in 1928, Amsterdam. The International status of the class was revoked in 1964 by the IYRU - but the dinghy is still raced widely across the world.

Pande family

The Pande family or Pande dynasty (Also spelled as Panday or Pandey) (; or ) was a Kshatriya (Rajput-Chhetri) political family that directly ruled Nepali administration affairs since the 16th century to 19th century as Mulkaji and Mukhtiyar (Prime Minister). This dynasty/family was one of the four noble family to be involved in active politics of Nepal together with Shah dynasty, Basnyat family and Thapa dynasty before rise of Rana dynasty. Pande dynasty is the oldest noble family to hold the title of Kaji. This family was decimated from political power in 1843 CE from the political massacre conducted by Prime Minister Mathabar Singh Thapa as a revenge for his uncle Bhimsen's death in 1839.
The family is descended from nobleman Ganesh Pande of the Gorkha Kingdom. Kalu Pande and Tularam Pande were descendants of Ganesh Pande. Pande dynasty and Thapa dynasty were the two chief political families who alternatively contested for central power in the Nepalese court politics. The Pande family was divided into two section Kala Pandes and Gora Pandes who were always aligned to opposite political factions. The Pande aristocratic family of "Gora" (White) Pande section was connected to Thapa dynasty through daughter of Chief Kazi Ranajit Pande, Rana Kumari who was married to Kaji General Nain Singh Thapa and to Rana dynasty through Nain Singh's son-in-law Bal Narsingh Kunwar. The Pande family of "Kala" (Black) Pande section was maritally linked to Basnyat Family through Chitravati Pande who married Kaji Kehar Singh Basnyat.
Ancestral Background.
Ganesh Pande was the first Kaji (Prime Minister) of King Dravya Shah of Gorkha Kingdom established in 1559 A.D. The Pandes were considered as Thar Ghar aristrocratic group who assisted the administration of Gorkha Kingdom. Kaji Kalu Pande (1714–1757) who belonged to this family became a war hero after he died at the Battle of Kirtipur. These Pandes were categorized with fellow Chhetri "Bharadars" such as Thapas, Basnyats and Kunwars.
The inscription installed by son of Tularam Pande, "Kapardar" Bhotu Pande, on the Bishnumati bridge explains their patrilineal relationship to Ganesh Pande, Minister of Drabya Shah, the first King of Gorkha Kingdom. The lineage mentions Ganesh Pande's son as Vishwadatta and Vishwadatta's son as Birudatta. Birudatta had two sons Baliram and Jagatloka. Tularam and Bhimraj were sons of Baliram and Jagatloka respectively. Kaji Kalu Pande was the son of Bhimraj. Bhotu Pande mentions Tularam, Baliram, and Birudatta respectively as his ancestors of three generations. However, Historian Baburam Acharya contends a major flaw in the inscription. Ranajit Pande, the second son of Tularam was born in 1809 Vikram Samvat. Baburam Acharya assumed 25 years for each generation where he found Vishwadatta to have been born in 1707 Vikram Samvat. Thus, on this basis, he strongly concluded that Vishwadatta could not have been the son of Ganesh Pande, who was living in 1616 Vikram Samvat, when Drabya Shah was crowned King of Gorkha. He points that the names of two more generations seem to be missing.
Caste Background.
Historian Baburam Acharya speculates that Ganesh Pande was a Brahmin, however, there was no conclusive evidence to the claim. He makes the assumption based on the claim of ancestry from Ganesh Pande by Pande Brahmins of Upamanyu gotra. He further assumes that Baliram and Jagatloka were Brahmins due to their Brahmin-looking name and assumes Tularam and Bhimaraj as Chhetri.
Relation between Kalu and Tularam.
As per Historian Baburam Acharya, Tularam was a brother (first cousin) of Bhimraj, the father of Kalu Pande. However, Historian Rishikesh Shah contends that Tularam was a brother of Kalu Pande.
Dominance of Damodar and catastrophe on Pandes.
Damodar Pande was appointed as one of the four Kajis by King Rana Bahadur Shah after removal of Chautariya Bahadur Shah of Nepal on 1794. Damodar was most influential and dominant in the court faction irrespective of post of Chief Kazi (Mulkazi) being held by Kirtiman Singh Basnyat. Pandes were the most dominant noble family. Later due to continuous irrational behaviour of King Rana Bahadur Shah, situation of civil war arose where Damodar was the main opposition to the King. He was forced to flee to the British-controlled city of Varanasi in May, 1800 after military men parted with influential Kaji Damodar.
After Queen Rajrajeshwari finally managed to assume the regency on 17 December 1802, later in February she elected Damodar Pande as the "Mul Kaji" (Chief Kaji). Damodar Pande, Pande family and faction, were responsible for treaty with British which incensed exiled King Rana Bahadur. The Treaty of 1801 was also unilaterally annulled by the British on 24 January 1804. The suspension of diplomatic ties also gave the Governor General a pretext to allow the ex-King Rana Bahadur to return to Nepal unconditionally.
Troops sent by Kathmandu Durbar changed their allegiance when they came face to face with the incoming ex-King Rana Bahadur. Damodar Pande and members of Pande factions were arrested at Thankot where they were waiting to greet the ex-King with state honors and take him into isolation. After Rana Bahadur's reinstatement to power, he ordered Damodar Pande, along with his two eldest sons, who were completely innocent, to be executed on 13 March 1804; similarly some members of his faction were tortured and executed without any due trial, while many others managed to escape to India. Among those who managed to escape to India were Damodar Pande's sons Karbir Pande and Rana Jang Pande.
Resurrection of Pandes.
During the Anglo-Nepalese War, Rana Jang Pande had informed Ranabir Singh Thapa that the British would be off guard during Christmas. Following this advice, Ranabir Singh was able to obtain a major victory during a battle in Parsa. This won the Pandes the trust of Ranabir Singh, which eventually led to their pardon by King Girvan and subsequent return to Nepal. In November of 1834, Ranjung Pande, the youngest son of Damodar Pande, petitioned the king to restore the lands and properties of the Pande family. To the surprise of the court, the king accepted the petition. The king, however, had not taken immediate action on this request. With royal support, Ranjung immediately sent a request to the Chinese Amban in Lhasa requesting they restore the families historical relation in Tibet. He had also accused Bhimsen Thapa of supporting the British which at the time were one of China's main enemies. After this, the Amban had then requested to the king that Ranjung be sent as a diplomat to Peking in the next diplomatic quinquennial year. By 1836, Rana Jang Pande was stationed as a captain in the army in Kathmandu. He was aware of the disunity between Samrajya Laxmi and Bhimsen Thapa; and thus he had secretly expressed his loyalty to Samrajya Laxmi and had vowed to help her in bringing Bhimsen down for all the wrongs he had committed against his family. Factions in the Nepalese court had also started to develop around the rivalry between the two queens, with the Senior Queen supporting the Pandes, while the Junior Queen supporting the Thapas. Pandes spread news of child born out of an adulterous relationship between Mathabar Singh Thapa and his widowed sister-in-law and the resulting public disgrace forced Mathabar to leave Kathmandu and reside in his ancestral home in Pipal Thok, Borlang, Gorkha. 
The weakening of power of Thapas in absence of Mathabar and Bhimsen in Kathmandu helped King Rajendra Bikram Shah to establish a new personal battalion, Hanuman Dal, and by February 1837, both Rana Jang Pande and his brother, Ranadal Pande, had been promoted to the position of a "Kaji"; and Ranajang was made a personal secretary to the King, while Ranadal Pande was made the governor of Palpa. Ranajang, the leader of Pandes, was also made the chief palace guard, the position formerly occupied by Ranabir Singh and then Bhimsen which curtailed Bhimsen's access to the royal family and reduced Thapas from the power. After the incarceration of the Thapas in the poisoning case in 1837, a new government with joint "Mukhtiyars" was formed with Ranga Nath Poudyal as the head of civil administration, and Dalbhanjan Pande and Ranajang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they started to make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country. After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranajang as "Mukhtiyar" and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole "Mukhtiyar".
Fearful that the Pandes would re-establish their power, Fatte Jang Shah, Rangnath Poudel, and the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi Devi obtained from the King the liberation of Bhimsen, Mathabar, and the rest of the party, about eight months after they were incarcerated for the poisoning case. However, Ranganath Poudel, finding himself unsupported by the King, resigned from the "Mukhtiyari", which was then conferred on Pushkar Shah; but Puskhar Shah was only a nominal head, and the actual authority was bestowed on Ranajang Pande. Sensing that a catastrophe was going to befall the Thapas, Mathabar Singh fled to India while pretending to go on a hunting trip; Ranbir Singh gave up all his property and became a sanyasi, titling himself Abhayanand Puri; but Bhimsen Thapa preferred to remain in his old home in Gorkha. The Pandes were now in full possession of power; they had gained over the King to their side by flattery. The Senior Queen had been a firm supporter of their party; and they endeavored to secure popularity in the army by promises of war and plunder.
At the beginning of 1839, Ranajang Pande was made the sole "Mukhtiyar". However, knowledge about Ranajang's war preparations and his communication with other princely states of India, fomenting anti-British sentiments, alarmed the Governor-General of the time, Lord Auckland, who mobilized some British troops near the border of Nepal. In order to resolve this diplomatic fiasco, Bhimsen was recalled from Gorkha releasing consfication after which he suggested some of the battalions under Ranajang's command to be given to other courtiers, thus severely weakening Ranajang's military power. After the ostracization of Thapas on fabricated cases with forged papers, Bhimsen,
the leader of Thapas, attempted suicide due to indignity after hearing rumors of his wife to be publicly disgraced on 28 July 1839. Five months after Bhimsen's death, Ranajang Pande was again made Mukhtiyar (prime minister); but Ranajang's inability to control the general lawlessness in the country forced him to resign from prime minister's office, which was then conferred on Pushkar Shah, based on Samrajya Laxmi's recommendation. Pushkar Shah and his Pande associates were dismissed, and Fatte Jang Shah was appointed Mukhtiyar (prime minister) in November 1840 due to British intervention. After the death of Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Junior Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fateh Jang and his administration supported the King, the Thapas supported the Junior Queen, while the Pandes supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jang's ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned.
Ultimate Fall of Pandes.
Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the highest authority of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son's power. The Queen, seeking support of her own son's claims to the throne over those of Surendra, invited eldest Thapa dynast Mathabar Singh Thapa back after almost six years in exile. Upon his arrival in Kathmandu on April 1843, an investigation of his uncle Bhimsen's death took place, and a number of his Pande enemies were massacred. As for Ranajang Pande, he had by that time contracted mental illness and would not have posed any threat to Mathabar. Nevertheless, Ranajang was paraded through the streets and made to witness the execution of his family members, after which he was forced to commit suicide by poison.
Pande Palaces.
As Thapathali was abode of the Thapas, Lazimpat was abode of Pandes. Lazimpat Durbar was property of "Kaji" Bir Keshar Pande.

Chloë Bass

Chloë Bass (born 1984) is an American conceptual artist who works in performance and social practice. Bass's work focuses on intimacy. She was a founding co-lead organizer of Arts in Bushwick from 2007-2011, the group that organizes Bushwick Open Studios. She is an Assistant Professor of Art and Social Practice at Queens College, CUNY, and holds a BA from Yale University and an MFA from Brooklyn College. Bass is also a regular contributor to publications like Hyperallergic.
Early life and education.
Bass was born in New York City in 1984 and lived on the Upper West Side. In 2002 she moved to New Haven to pursue a BA in Theatre Studies at Yale University. Two labor strikes in 2003, including a dining hall workers' strike, strongly affected Bass's undergraduate experience, and influenced her later involvement with organizing.
She completed her MFA in Performance and Interactive Media at Brooklyn College in 2011.
Career.
Bass moved to Bushwick in 2006, after her undergraduate degree programme. In Bushwick she became a co-lead organizer of Arts in Bush-wick (2007-2011), and helped to organize Bushwick Open Studios, a project of which she is now critical, saying that "ultimately the damaging effect [of BOS] has been greater than the fun." While living in Bushwick, Bass worked to register the area's voters and, as a result of a displacement mapping project, gained a seat on Community Board Four, which she held until 2012. In 2011, she moved to an apartment in Bed-Stuy, where she currently lives. In 2014 she was the Create Change resident for The Laundromat Project in Bed-Stuy, creating a work called "The Department of Local Affairs". For this work she collected information in the form of writing, drawing, and conversation by and for locals, examining what this looked like in contrast to information collected by companies for advertising or tourism.
Her ongoing eight-chapter project exploring individual social interactions, "The Book of Everyday" "Instruction", has been presented at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and other venues. Chapters from this work have included creating poetic installations in bathrooms and inviting gallery goers to smell jars of spice. Her work has been exhibited at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts, Cooper Union, The Bronx Museum of the Arts, the Neuberger Museum of Art, the Knockdown Center, and Momenta Art, amongst other venues. She is the recipient of residencies at The Laundromat Project, Bemis Center, Triangle Arts Association, and Lower Manhattan Cultural Counsel (LMCC) Workspace residency, and was nominated for the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Grant.
In 2019 the Studio Museum in Harlem commissioned her first institutional solo exhibition, "Wayfinding" (2019) at St. Nicholas Park.

1st Ayrshire and Galloway Artillery Volunteers

The 1st Ayrshire and Galloway Artillery Volunteer Corps was formed in 1859 as a response to a French invasion threat. It transferred to the Territorial Force (TF) in 1908 and its successor units fought with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division in Palestine during World War I, and in and Burma during World War II. It continued in the Territorial Army (TA) until amalgamation in 1967.
Artillery Volunteers.
The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle and Artillery Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need. The 1st Administrative Brigade of Ayrshire Artillery Volunteers was formed with its headquarters (HQ) at Irvine, North Ayrshire, in November 1860. It comprised the following Ayrshire Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs):
In 1863, the following corps were added to the brigade:
The first commanding officer (CO) of the administrative brigade was Major Sir Edward Hunt-Blair, 4th Baronet of Dunskey, Wigtown, appointed on 8 May 1861, who was replaced on 17 July 1863 by Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon Greville Vernon, whose his second-in-command (with the rank of major) was Captain (later Admiral) John Eglinton Montgomerie, Royal Navy. Hunter-Blair was reappointed (with the rank of lieutenant-colonel) on 4 September 1866.
In 1863, brigade HQ moved from Irvine to Ayr, and in May 1880 the brigade was consolidated as the 1st Ayrshire &amp; Galloway Artillery Volunteers, with headquarters at Ayr and 11 batteries as follows:
Position artillery.
The AVCs were intended to serve as garrison artillery manning fixed defences, but a number of the early units manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. At that time they were not officially supported by the War Office (WO). The concept was revived in 1888 when some Volunteer batteries were reorganised as position artillery to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. In 1889, a position battery of 16-pounder Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) guns was issued to the 1st Ayrshire &amp; Galloway and manned by the two Kilmarnock batteries. In that year the HQ moved to Kilmarnock.
In 1892, the existing position battery took the number 1, absorbing the 6th and 7th Companies. In 1901, two more batteries of 9 Pounder Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) guns were issued to the corps, which took the numbers 2 and 3 and absorbed the Irvine and Ayr Companies, and an extra personnel formed as a 6th Company at Kilmarnock. The 8th to 11th Companies took the numbers 7 to 10.
Royal Garrison Artillery.
In 1882 all the AVCs were affiliated to one of the territorial garrison divisions of the Royal Artillery (RA) and the 1st Ayrshire &amp; Galloway AVC became part of the Scottish Division. In 1889 the structure was altered, and the corps joined the Southern Division. In 1899 the RA was divided into separate field and garrison branches, and the artillery volunteers were all assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). When the divisional structure was abolished their titles were changed, the unit becoming the 1st Ayrshire and Galloway Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) on 1 January 1902, with its HQ at Kilmarnock. The following year the position batteries were redesignated as heavy batteries.
In 1903, 4.7-inch Quick Firing (QF) guns replaced the RML armament of all three heavy batteries. The final organisation of the unit until 1908 was as follows:
The corps carried out its gun practice at Irvine. It used the Ayrshire Rifle Association range at Irvine for musketry, except the 7th to 10th Companies, which had ranges near their own headquarters.
In 1900, over 600 men of the unit volunteered to serve in the Second Boer War, but as artillery men were not required they were not accepted. Twenty-eight men served in South Africa during the war with other units.
Territorial Force.
When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force in 1908 under the Haldane Reforms, the 1st Ayrshire and Galloway RGA (V) formed the II (or 2nd) Lowland Brigade in the Royal Field Artillery (RFA). It also provided a nucleus for the Lowland Mounted Brigade Transport &amp; Supply Column, Army Service Corps. The new unit had the following organisation:
II Lowland Brigade, RFA
The II Lowland Brigade was part of the TF's Lowland Division. The batteries were each issued with four 15-pounder guns.
World War I.
Mobilisation.
The Lowland Division had been attending annual camp on the Ayrshire coast when the order to mobilise was received at 17.25 on Tuesday August 1914. Mobilisation began the following day at unit drill halls. On 12 August the division was ordered to concentrate at Bedford and entrainment began on 15 August. Concentration was completed by 17 August and the division formed part of First Army (Home Forces) in Central Force.
On the outbreak of war, units of the TF were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August the WO issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. Then on 31 August the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.
1/II Lowland Brigade.
1/II Lowland Brigade embarked with the rest of the division for the Mediterranean in May 1915, and landed at Alexandria the following month. However, it was not employed in the Gallipoli Campaign and remained in Egypt. It rejoined the rest of the division at El Qantara in March 1916 and the following month it was re-armed with 18-pounder guns. It was redesignated CCLX (or 260) Brigade, RFA, on 25 May 1916, and renumbered CCLXI (261) Brigade on 15 September. It transferred to 7th (Meerut) Division when the 52nd left for the Western Front in April 1918 and served with this Indian Army formation in Palestine until the end of the war. It was placed in suspended animation in 1919.
2/II Lowland Brigade.
2/II Lowland Brigade served with the 2nd Lowland Division (65th (2nd Lowland) Division from August 1915) in Scotland and England. It was redesignated CCCXXVI (or 326) Brigade, RFA, in May 1916. Early in 1917 the division was sent to Ireland. It was broken up in early 1918, but 326 Bde remained at Kildare until 27 October 1919 when it completed its disbandment.
Interwar years.
The 2nd Lowland Brigade reformed in 1920, and was redesignated as the 79th (Lowland) Brigade, RFA, the following year when the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA). It became a 'Field Brigade, RA', when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery in 1924. It continued to be part of 52nd (Lowland) Division and had the following organisation:
Field Brigades were termed Field Regiments from 1938 onwards.
World War II.
Mobilisation.
The TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis of 1938, with existing units splitting to form duplicates before the outbreak of World War II. 79th Field Regiment reorganised as follows:
79th (Lowland) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery
130th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery
The establishment of a field battery was increased to 12 guns organised into three Troops.
79th (Lowland) Field Regiment.
79th Field Regiment mobilised in 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division. Apart from a period in June 1940 when the rest of the division was briefly deployed to France, the regiment served with the 52nd (L) Division throughout the war, including the from October 1944 to VE Day. It was placed in suspended animation in 1946
130th (Lowland) Field Regiment.
130th Field Regiment mobilised in 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division (the duplicate of 52nd (Lowland)) and served with it through the early years of war. The regiment received its 'Lowland' subtitle in 1942. It left the 15th (S) Division on 4 January 1942 and sailed to India, where it joined first 14th Indian Infantry Division and later 36th Indian Division, with which it served in the Burma Campaign. 36th Indian Division became 36th British Division in September 1944 and continued fighting in Burma.
Postwar.
When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the 79th reformed at Ayr as 279th (Lowland) Field Rgt, while 130th reformed at Troon (later returning to Kilmarnock) as 330th (Lowland) Medium Rgt. Both were in 85 (Field) Army Group Royal Artillery, which was redesignated HQ RA 52nd (Lowland) Division in 1950.
In 1961 the TA was reduced, and most of 279th Fd Rgt amalgamated with 280th (Lowland – City of Glasgow) Medium Rgt to form 279th (City of Glasgow &amp; Ayrshire) Fd Rgt with the following organisation:
Surplus personnel of 279th (Ayrshire) Fd Rgt were transferred to 576 (General Transport) Company, Royal Army Service Corps.
When the TA was reduced to the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967, the regiment merged with 277th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Field Rgt and 278th (Lowland) Field Rgt to form 'S (Ayrshire)' and 'T (Glasgow)' Btys in the Glasgow-based Lowland Regiment, RA. The Lowland Regiment was reduced to a cadre in 1969 and disbanded in 1975, but in 1986 105 (Scottish) Air Defence Regiment was designated as its successor unit.
Uniforms.
The original uniform of the 1st and 2nd Ayrshire AVCs was blue tunics with red collars, cuffs, and piping, edged all round with black braid and with four rows of black braid across the chest. Blue trousers with black stripe with red piping were also worn, along with blue peaked caps with a black lace band, scarlet piping, and a silver grenade in front. Black waist-belts were worn. The original uniform of the 1st Wigtown was blue with scarlet facings, white belts, and silver badges.
Commanding officers.
The commanding officers of the unit included:
Honorary Colonels.
The following served as Honorary Colonel of the unit:

Carol Flax is an artist who has worked in both theater and film, and marketing and communications. She retired and moved to Cape Cod (2013). She has been using the surrounding landscapes to create her “Cut Paper Mosaics” which is the main medium for her relatively new life as a professional artist.
Current Residency and Works:
Professional Affiliations:
Elected Member, Audubon Artists, Inc., Past President of the Society of Cape Cod Craftsmen
Where Work is Displayed:
The Rice Gallery at Woodruff Art Center, Mashpee Commons, Mashpee, MA
October 8, 2017: Creative Hands Gallery, Sandwich, MA
Education.
Flax attended Heidelberg College and earned a BA in English, in addition to receiving an MA in Speech &amp; Theater from the University of Michigan.
Artistry.
Technique.
Flax is considered a visual artist for her work in representational collage. This is a style that she created in her twenties, but did not receive any recognition for at the time. The artist describes her own process, calling it “Cut Paper Mosaics," where she essentially recycles paper from materials such as magazines. She then cuts the paper and glues pieces to her surface of choice, often a collage board, using a brush-stroke pattern to create the illusion of a painting.
Influence.
While aspirations of an early art career did not work out for Flax, she kept the idea of Cut Paper Mosaics in the back of her mind. Eventually when she retired to Cape Cod in 2013, she revived and refined this idea and began her career as a professional artist. Now she plays with the idea of "upcycling" to turn used paper into art. Additionally, Flax enjoys creating her works to resemble paintings in an attempt to fool viewers when they first encounter her work. She enjoys the aspect of searching for the colors and textures she needs for each landscape. Flax is an Elected Member of Audubon Artists, Inc. (at the Salmagundi Club, NYC); and artist member of: Fuller Craft Museum, the Cotuit Center for the Arts, the Sandwich Arts Alliance and the Arts Foundation of Cape Cod.
Awards.
Most notably, Flax received the Audubon Artists Silver Medal of Honor in 2016 for her collage "Mayflower Beach iii." Additionally, she won the Work on Paper Prize for her painting "Gray’s Beach Low Tide" in the 2014 National Prize Show, juried by James Welu.

Euura venusta

Euura venusta is a species of sawfly belonging to the family Tenthredinidae (common sawflies). The larvae feed within the leaf-stalk (or petiole) of willows ("Salix" species) forming a gall. The sawfly was first described by Carl Gustav Alexander Brischke in 1883.
Description of the gall.
The gall is formed in the petiole and is 8–10 mm long and 2–4 mm wide at the base. It contains one larva, along with its frass, and can be found on eared willow ("S. aurita"), goat willow ("S. caprea"), grey willow ("S. cinerea"), downy willow ("S. lapponum") and "S. silesiaca".
"Euura venusta" is one of three closely related species known as the "Euura amerinae" species subgroup. The other member of the group is "E. testaceipes" (Brischke, 1883).
Distribution.
The sawfly has been found in central and northern Europe and the Russian far east, including Armenia, Belgium, Great Britain, Luxembourg, Norway, Russia and Sweden.

Barbara Benedek

Barbara Benedek (born 1948) is an American screenwriter best known for co-writing the 1983 film "The Big Chill", for which she received a Writers Guild of America Award and several award nominations.
Career.
Benedek was a psychiatric researcher prior to becoming interested in screenwriting. Her first entertainment industry job was as sitcom storywriter and editor for Witt-Thomas-Harris.
Her first film screenplay was for the 1983 comedy-drama film "The Big Chill". For her work on the film she received, along with co-writer Lawrence Kasdan, the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1984. She was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, and was runner-up for the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award.
She went on to write screenplays for "Immediate Family" (1989) and "Men Don't Leave" (1990). In his two-star review of "Men Don't Leave", Roger Ebert speculated that Benedek's screenplay started out "a good deal more realistic and honest," but that it was subject to detrimental revisions in the filmmaking process.
Benedek was an uncredited writer for the 1990 film "Pretty Woman". According to director Garry Marshall, "We had five different writers on "Pretty Woman" ... In all the rewrites, the part of Vivian, the prostitute, came quite easily. It was the character of the businessman, Edward Lewis, that presented the most problems. Only Barbara Benedek, the sole woman writer in the group, got the voice of Edward down by creating a Donald Trump-style executive with a vulnerable side."
In 1995 Benedek wrote the screenplay for "Sabrina", a remake of a 1954 film of the same name. It began as a fully original screenplay. Due to similarities to the 1954 film, producer Scott Rudin suggested adapting that story instead.

List of Romanian-built warships of World War II

During and up to the Second World War, the naval industry of the Kingdom of Romania produced numerous medium and small size warships, of varying types, as well as auxiliaries. Warships were produced mainly for the Romanian Navy, but later Romanian naval facilities and products also benefited the "Kriegsmarine", among others.
Facilities.
The most important Romanian shipyard was at Galați, followed by the one at Constanța and finally the ones at Severin and Brăila. Galați benefited of the country's only dry dock, built in 1937. It also had two floating docks which could lift 200 and 300 tons respectively. The entire facility employed 500–800 people. Constanța, although lacking a dry dock, had by far the largest floating dock in the country, able to lift up to 8,000 tons. Brăila also had a floating dock for small craft, which could lift up to 100 tons. Severin had no dry or floating dock, but for much of the interwar it was the only other port in the country besides Galați able to produce anything larger than barges, lighters and small river craft. Maximum annual building capacity amounted to 1,500 tons as of 1933. This facility employed 100 people.
Warships produced for the Romanian Navy.
"Mihail Kogălniceanu"-class.
In 1907, despite lacking a dry dock, the Romanian shipyard at Galați was able to co-build a class of four 700-ton river monitors for the Romanian Danube Flotilla: the "Mihail Kogălniceanu" class. The four vessels of this class were built in sections at STT in Austria-Hungary, transported to Romania then assembled and launched at Galați. Each monitor had an overall armour thickness of 70–75 mm. During World War II, all four monitors were fitted for service at sea as anti-submarine escorts, each being armed with three 120 mm naval guns in single armored turrets, one 76 mm naval/AA gun, two 47 mm naval guns and two depth charge throwers (one of 760 mm and the other of 700 mm). The four warships were in service throughout both world wars. "Mihail Kogălniceanu" engaged in battle and damaged two Soviet river monitors during the first month of "Operation Barbarossa". She also shot down one Soviet aircraft on 29 June 1941.
"Amiral Murgescu".
"Amiral Murgescu" was a multi-purpose warships, serving as both minelayer and escort ship. With a standard displacement of 812 tons and a full load displacement exceeding 1,000 tons, she was the largest Romanian-built warship of World War II and also the first sea-going warship built in Romania. "Amiral Murgescu" was laid down on 1 August 1938 and launched on 14 June 1939. Her commissioning took place on 2 March 1941 She measured 76.9 meters in length, with a beam of 9.1 meters and a draught of 2.5 meters. She was armed with two 105 mm SK C/32 dual-purpose naval/AA guns, two Rheinmetall 37 mm guns and four Oerlikon 20 mm guns. She could carry up to 135 mines. She was also fitted with two depth charge throwers. With 12 Soviet aircraft shot down and numerous Soviet warships sunk or damaged by her mines, "Amiral Murgescu" was the most effective Romanian Navy warship of the Second World War.
"Marsuinul" and "Rechinul".
"Marsuinul" was designed by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw in the Hague, her design being an improvement of the earlier "Vetehinen"-class of the Finnish Navy. She was laid down at the Galați shipyard in 1938 and launched on 4 May 1941. She had a standard (surfaced) displacement of 620 tons, a length of 58 meters, a beam of 5.6 meters and a draught of 3.6 meters. Her power plant consisted of two MAN diesel engines and two electric motors powering two shafts, giving her a top speed of 16 knots on surface and 9 knots in immersion. She was armed with one 105 mm deck gun, one 37 mm anti-aircraft gun and six 533 mm torpedo tubes (four in the bow and two in the stern), her crew amounting to 45.
"Rechinul" was a minelaying submarine, also designed by Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS) and built at the Galați shipyard in Romania. She was also laid down in 1938 and launched on 22 May 1941. She had the same power plant as her sister, with a slightly faster surface top speed of 17 knots, due to her standard (surfaced) displacement of 585 tons (35 tons lighter than her sister). Her submerged top speed was however the same, 9 knots. She was armed with four 533 mm torpedo tubes (all in the bow), one 88 mm deck gun, one 20 mm anti-aircraft gun and could carry up to 40 mines in 10 vertical tubes (5 tubes on each side). Her crew amounted to 40.
"DB-13"-class.
Four vessels of the German M1940 type were acquired by the Romanian Navy in 1943. They were built locally from German materials. These Romanian warships had a standard displacement of 543 tons and a full load displacement of 775 tons. They measured 62 meters in length, with a beam of 8.5 meters and a draught of 2.3 meters. Armament consisted of two 88 mm guns plus one twin 37 mm and three single 20 mm anti-aircraft guns, as well as two depth charge throwers. Two-shaft triple-expansion coal engines generated an output of 2,400 hp resulting in a top speed of 17 knots and a range of just over 1,000 nautical miles at that speed. Each of the four vessels ("DB-13", "DB-14", "DB-15" and "DB-16") had a crew of 80. In 1951, their power plants were converted to oil. It is possible that, although launched in 1943, none of the ships was actually completed by the end of the war, but in 1953.
Small warships and auxiliaries.
The "Vedenia" class was a unique derivation of the British Power Boat MTB. By design, the six vessels of this class represented the Dutch version of the Power boat. They were built under licence at the Galați shipyard in Romania, being laid down in 1939 and commissioned in 1943. The six boats, numbered 4 to 9, were named "Vedenia", "Vântul", "Vijelia", "Viforul", "Vârtejul" and "Vulcanul". "Vijelia" and "Viforul" were named after their Vospers type predecessors, which were sunk in November 1941 by Soviet mines. Each of the six boats was armed with two 20 mm anti-aircraft guns and two 457 mm (18 inch) torpedo tubes. The six boats were in service until at least 1954.
As of 1942, the first military vessel known to have been built in Romania was still in use. She was a 10-ton steam launch, used for border patrol. Built at Galați in 1900, she measured 14 meters in length, with a beam of 2.40 meters and a draught of 1 meter. Her top speed was of 8 knots with a crew of 5.
In regard to auxiliary vessels, barges of up to 1,700 tons were built at Galați before the war. Two such barges were fitted for coastal defense as floating artillery sections, each barge being armed with two guns: one with 47 mm guns and the other with 152 mm guns. These two armed barges were towed by two military tugs of over 600 tons each, built at Galați in 1941. The two tugs were named "Vârtosu" and "Stoicescu". These maritime vessels were supplemented by a 420-ton river steamer, built prewar at the same shipyard. In 1942, Romania launched its first native-built tanker. Named "SRT-128", she was also built at Galați.
Warships assembled for the "Kriegsmarine".
In order to boost Axis naval strength in the Black Sea, the OKW ordered to the region the transfer of six E-boats of the 1st S-flotilla, the last to be released from action in the Baltic Sea before refit. The Romanian port of Constanța was elected as the S-flotilla's headquarters. Transporting the six boats overland from Germany to Romania was an impressive logistical feat. The superstructure and all weapons were removed, leaving only the hull. After a long road journey of 60 hours, the boats arrived at Ingolstadt, where they were transferred back to water and towed towards Linz. Upon reaching the Austrian city, the superstructure was rebuilt, then the journey continued down the Danube to Galați, where the main engines were installed. The E-boats then continued on their own power towards Constanța, where refitting was completed.
Six U-boats of the rather small coastal submarine Type IIB, which at the time served as training vessels in the Baltic Sea, were assigned to the Black Sea theatre. Starting from May 1942, they were partially dismantled in Kiel, to reduce weight and size. Toppled over 90°, and fitted with additional floating devices, the stripped down hulls, weighing 140 tons, were shipped through the Kiel Canal and on the Elbe up to Dresden-Übigau, where they were placed on two 70 ton Culemeyer road transporters hauled by Kaelble tractors. The boats then traveled at an average speed of 5 mph over the Reichsautobahn (modern day A4 and A9) to the slipway in Ingolstadt. Traveling down the Danube, one obstacle was the old Stone Bridge of Regensburg with its arches. Eventually, the submarines arrived in the Romanian port of Galați where they were re-assembled.
Romanian shipyards also built numerous "Siebelfähre" type landing craft for the local "Kriegsmarine" forces. Further production of landing craft and invasion barges was also realized, all from pre-fabricated parts delivered by Germany and Italy.

Igo Hatsuyōron

Igo Hatsuyōron (囲碁 発陽論, literally : "On yang production in the game of go", often abbreviated Hatsuyōron) is a collection of 183 go problems (mostly tsumego), compiled in 1713 by the Japanese go master Inoue Dōsetsu Inseki.
Until the end of the 19th century, the "Hatsuyōron" remained a closely guarded secret of the Inoue house, where it was used to drill the best disciples in the tactics. It became public after the collapse of the Four go houses; several incorrect editions are published, before the discovery in 1982 of a copy that is close to the original now lost.
"Igo Hatsuyōron" is considered the most difficult of such collections, and as such is still used for training Go professionals. It contains many problems so complex that false or incomplete solutions were given in the first editions, and in particular an exceptional problem by its theme and its depth, rediscovered in 1982, and which is not yet completely solved in 2015.
History.
Inoue Dōsetsu Inseki, the fourth head of the Inoue house and Meijin from 1708 to his death in 1719, is best known for his role as guardian of the young Dōchi after the death of his master Dōsaku; his exceptional skill as a composer of go problems was only discovered after the collapse of the Four go houses from 1868, during the Meiji Restoration.
In 1713, Dōsetsu compiled "Igo Hatsuyōron" from a collection of more than 1500 problems, many of which were composed by him or improved from previous problems. The book is designed to serve the training of the best disciples, and to this end contains only the problems, without any indication on their solution. For more than 150 years, it was kept secret, being studied only one problem at a time, under the direct control of the Inoue house; the very existence of the book was ignored by the other three houses (Hon'inbō, Hayashi and Yasui).
The "Hatsuyōron" became public after 1868 (passing from hand to hand in the Hon'inbō house), and a first edition is published in 1914 by Hon'inbō Shūsai, enriched with solutions and comments; from that moment, the book acquired its reputation of the "most difficult collection of go problems". Two other editions, mostly from Shūsai’s, but improving and detailing the solutions, appeared in 1953 (under the direction of Hideyuki Fujisawa) and in 1980 (under the direction of Utaro Hashimoto). These editions, however, are based not on the original manuscript (which is thought to have been destroyed in a fire), but on incorrect copies, into which some problems from "Xuanxuan Qijing" (the oldest Chinese classics) slipped.
In 1982, Araki Naomi discovered a previous copy apparently containing only the problems of the original version, including two previously unknown; the responsibility of a new edition was entrusted to Hideyuki Fujisawa (then Kisei), which caused him to look more closely at one of these two problems (the number 120), to conclude that this is "The most difficult problem ever composed"; he publishes an article on this subject, detailing the remarks of the complete edition.
From 1988, an analysis of the solutions of the 1982 edition by Chinese professionals led them to question some of the Japanese conclusions; Cheng Xiaoliu published in 2010 a revised edition of their comments, under the title of "Wéiqí Fāyánglùn Yánjiū" (围棋 发 阳 论 研究, Research on Hatsuyōron).
Content.
The exact initial composition of the collection is unknown, and the order of the problems is probably corrupt; Cheng Xiaoliu noted that in the edition of 1914, the first problem has no solution, and suggests that it could have been placed in first position by some rival school, to discredit the book.
The copy used in the 1982 edition, however, is considered fairly close to the original work composed by Dōsetsu, and also contains a written postface by his hand, in which he explains in particular the meaning of the title of the collection and how it should be studied; this copy contains 183 problems, divided into six sections:
Most of these problems (except perhaps those of the last two sections) can be considered life and death problems; the "Hatsuyōron" does not deal with issues of strategy, but only aims to develop the capacity of tactical play. These problems, however, are not "realistic" in the sense that they would come from situations that can be met in a real game; they seek above all to show extraordinary moves and maneuvers, and to force one to envisage well-hidden resistances; moreover, one of the conventions chosen for these problems is that "all the stones of the initial setting must be useful", which Dōsetsu sometimes exploits for additional artistic effects, as displayed by the example of problem 43.
Almost all these problems are at the level of professional players (and are still used in their training), that is to say that an amateur player cannot solve them in a game situation, without the mental aid of laying stones on the board; some of them are so difficult that they are probably insoluble under these conditions, even by the best players; this is particularly the case of the seven problems covering the entire goban, including the astonishing problem 76, which he gives the title "the bait catches the fish".
The most difficult problem ever composed.
In 1982, a copy from the 19th century was found, containing two problems not included in previous editions. The manuscript was entrusted to Fujisawa Hideyuki (then Kisei) to make a new edition commented on it, but, assuming that the problem 120 had been copied badly, he handed it over to one of his disciples, Yasuda Yasutoshi, to try to rectify it. He finally saw the unprecedented sacrifice maneuver which is the main theme of the problem, and after about a thousand hours of collective work, Fujisawa believed that the problem is solved, and published its solution, translated in "GB World" number 29 under the title "The Most Difficult Problem Ever", accompanied by a complimentary comment, mentioning "the surprising novelty of the theme and forms, the precise calculation of the fights, and the delicate balance of trade and score, all of which make this unique problem the masterpiece of a lifetime".
The statement of the problem (figure on the right) is a position that could almost be drawn from a real game, accompanied by the caption "Black plays and wins the game"; the solution is, in the main variant, a long series of battles using tactics unthinkable even for professional players, containing in particular a sacrifice of twenty black stones that White is obliged to refuse as long as possible, and completing, after more than one hundred and fifty moves, end-game subtleties ("yose") finally ending in a Black victory by one or two points.
This analysis is not disputed by the Chinese edition of "Hatsuyōron" in 1988, although this edition contains an improvement of the main sequence, bringing the margin of Black's victory to three points. But in 2005, a German amateur player, Joachim Meinhardt, discovered an unexpected resistance of White confirmed by professionals, this line of play questions all previous solutions. At the end of 2007, another German amateur, Thomas Redecker, observed that a seemingly mediocre play by Black, which had never been envisaged until then, played at the opportune moment (at move 67) of the main variant), perhaps allows the situation to be saved and decided to publish all of the analyses on a website, later in the form of a book. They are enriched (first with the help of a wiki) by many amateur and professional players, and a winning line for Black was confirmed by professional players starting in 2012, but, in 2015, new variations appeared again; the problem cannot therefore be considered as completely resolved.
From 2016 onwards, the spectacular progress in artificial intelligence led some optimistic amateurs to believe that a solution could be obtained by computer, but attempts in this direction were disappointing until 2019. However, in October 2019, a significant improvement in the deep learning techniques used made it possible to discover new variations based on moves never before envisaged, showing that a definitive solution has still not been reached.

Evelyn C. White

Evelyn Corliss White (born March 29, 1954) is an American writer and editor. Her books include the collection "Black Women's Health Book: Speaking for Ourselves" and the biography "Alice Walker: A Life".
Early life and education.
Evelyn C. White was born on March 29, 1954 in Chicago, Illinois to Amanda Cantrells and Andrew S. White. She was one of five siblings. White grew up in a working class neighborhood in Gary, Indiana and attended Alain L Locke Elementary School.
After graduating from Wellesley College in 1976, she worked for a theatre company in Denmark. Returning to the United States, she studied theatre at the University of Washington and began writing professionally while living in Seattle. She graduated from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1985.
In 1991, White earned a Master's degree in public administration from Harvard University.
Career.
White joined the staff of the "San Francisco Chronicle" in the mid-1980s. She published her first two books, "Chain, Chain, Change: For Black Women in Abusive Relationships" and "Black Women's Health Book: Speaking for Ourselves", with Seal Press, a small feminist press based in Seattle, Washington.
"Black Women's Health Book" included chapters from Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and Toni Morrison. Writing for the "New York Times", Linda Villarosa observed that some of the book's topics were "unavoidably depressing" but noted that "when the essays hit home, they hit hard". "Publishers Weekly" summarized the book's 41 different writings as covering "the vast spectrum of the black women's health experience as patient, healer and witness". In the "San Francisco Chronicle" Patricia Holt concluded that the book "breaks the silence, bursts the taboos, and mends many hearts along the way".
While White was teaching at a writing center in Oregon, one of her students brought her into contact with the novelist Alice Walker, who had read newspaper articles that White had written for the "San Francisco Chronicle". After a decade of White's work on Walker's biography, "Alice Walker: A Life" was published by Norton in 2004, with "The New York Times" calling it a "rich, complex story" and "Publishers Weekly" describing it as a "vibrant narrative".
White currently lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and has contributed to publications like "The Coast", "The Nova Scotia Advocate", "Halifax Examiner".

The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis

"The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis" is an episode of the American comedy television series "The Big Bang Theory". It first aired on CBS in the United States on December 15, 2008. It is the eleventh episode of the second season of the series and the twenty ninth episode overall.
Plot.
Leonard (Johnny Galecki) assists award winning scientist David Underhill (Michael Trucco) with his research. Leonard is overjoyed to be helping Underhill but becomes jealous when the handsome scientist starts dating Penny. This quickly ends in a break up when Penny discovers nude photos of his wife on his phone. Leonard only learns of this when he comes to Penny's apartment to confront her about their own on-off relationship. When he realises his mistake, he and Penny cuddle to comfort each other.
Sheldon (Jim Parsons) who disdains Christmas as a pagan ritual is disconcerted when Penny (Kaley Cuoco) brings him a Christmas gift. He now feels obligated to buy her a gift that matches the value of her gift to him, and enlists Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar) to help him with this task which they reluctantly agree to. After deciding on a basket of bath items he discovers a large selection, so not knowing what Penny will get him, he buys the entire range to cover all contingencies. Penny's gift to Sheldon is a napkin both autographed and used by Leonard Nimoy. Sheldon, overwhelmed since he now possesses Nimoy's DNA and can grow his own Leonard Nimoy, gives Penny all the gift baskets and also a rare "Sheldon" hug.
Reception.
The episode received largely positive reviews. Donna Bowman of "The A.V. Club" said "I wasn't feeling this episode until the epilogue — and then it became so wonderful that it almost spilled over into acts one through three".
IGN's James Chamberlain called the entire episode good, while calling the end "golden", saying "...the end was nearly perfect."
TV Critic called it the best episode of the season, praising the episode for "Combining character development and humour in a blend which this show can do really well."

Blue Views

Blue Views is the fifth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack, then a member of the supergroup Mike + The Mechanics. It was Carrack's first solo album in seven years; in the interim period between solo albums, he had recorded one album as a member of Squeeze, one album as a member of Spin 1ne 2wo, and two albums as a member of Mike + The Mechanics. "Blue Views" was originally released in 1995 on I.R.S. Records in the UK and most other territories. In the US, it appeared on the Ark 21 label.
The album was produced by Carrack's erstwhile Mike + The Mechanics bandmate Peter Van Hooke, who had left the group the previous year. "Blue Views" spun off two UK top 40 hits: "Eyes of Blue" and a re-recording of "How Long", which Carrack had originally written and sung 22 years earlier as a member of the band Ace.
In the US, "Eyes of Blue" was a minor hit on the Adult Contemporary (AC) charts, while the track "For Once in Our Lives" was a major AC hit, peaking at #3.
The song "Love Will Keep Us Alive", a Carrack co-wrote, had been previously recorded by The Eagles for their 1994 album "Hell Freezes Over".
Reception.
AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls "Blue Views" "solid adult contemporary pop", and while criticizing some of the "spotty" material, writes that "Carrack's vocals are terrific and the sound is appealingly polished."

Li Tournoiement as dames

Li Tournoiement as dames ("The Ladies' Tournament") is part of a medieval German short story collection called Mären. This collection was written, or at least composed, by an anonymous author shortly before 1300. While scholars have included it as a type of French fabliau, being contested due to the varying ownership of Alsace-Lorraine, it has stood out as a "unique" or "experimental" text for its time. It is studied as a text in German and French Medieval literature. 
Plot.
The characters in the story are from an elite or upper class status. Their society is made up of knights, thus it revolves around battle. They hold the values of chivalry and honor in high regard. When their land is attacked the men are forced to leave for war, and the women are left behind in a community of their own. In this new society the women settle disputes by holding discussions among themselves, and leadership is won by developing the best rhetorical skills. During a debate on whether or not women gain honor or share the same honor as men a challenge is presented to the group, "the women are to put on the men's armor, mount the men's warhorses, and joust against each other in the pursuit of honor." In the battle the woman who wins is the poorest among them, and was forced to ride bearing the name of a famous knight, rather than a familial name. Once their story has traveled through the land, and this famous knight has heard of her victory, he comes to meet this poor maiden. He feels pity for her, so he gives her dowry and marries her off to a rich man. 
Scholarly importance.
This text gives insight to the marriage system present in medieval central European society, and its closes tie with the importance of status. It also reveals to what degree women may have been involved in medieval french militancy.

Hoy (Lake Constance)

Hoy is an uninhabited island in Lake Constance in Germany. It lies 400 metres east of the island of Lindau in the Bay of Reutin and 100 metres south of the lakeshore near the mouth of the "Oberreitnauer Ach" ("Lindauer Ach").
Geography.
Description.
The island is roughly rectangular in shape, with a length of nine metres and a width of five to six metres. It covers an area of 53 m². The island of Hoy is part of the quarter and "Gemarkung" of Reutin in the borough of Lindau, which, until 1922, was an independent municipality. A willow tree dominates the tiny island, its crown covering most of the surface area. The shore of the island is enclosed by a wall, the top of which is 2 metres above the surface of the lake.
Nature reserve.
Hoy and the surrounding Bay of Reutin ("Reutiner Bucht") is designated as a nature reserve. It has certain similarities with an artificial island in the lake of Chiemsee, the Schalch, which is also in Bavaria.
History.
According to locals, Hoy is occasionally (but incorrectly) called Galgeninsel ("Gallows Island"), but the real Galgeninsel, a former imperial execution site, lies 550 metres further east and has been a peninsula since the mid-19th century.
In reality, Hoy is a small artificial island, which was built by the then owner of the nearby "Villa Seeheim" (on the left, eastern bank of the Lindauer Ach river, opposite the town council offices). Construction was started on 20 February 1922 and, in 1934, the completion of the island was celebrated with the raising of a flag, singing and speeches.
The island was used in the years that followed as a private bathing island; it also had a bathing hut, which burned down in 1945.

Rappahannock Academy was a military academy founded in 1813 in Virginia. Located on a hill near the Rappahannock River, the site was deemed well situated and brick buildings were constructed. The school's name was changed to Rappahannock Academy and Military Institute (RA&amp;MI) in 1847.
William Mahone taught at RA&amp;MI from January 1848 until July 1849. It was as large as Virginia Military Institute by 1860. Subjects taught at the school included military science and uniform requirements. The American Civil War (1861 - 1865) disrupted the school's program and drew most of its students into service.
The historic Mount Church (built circa 1750) was given by the state of Virginia to the school. Charles A. Lewis headed the school twice.
The school and its property were sold off in 1873.

Chelsea Barracks bombing

The Chelsea Barracks bombing was an attack carried out by a London-based Active Service Unit (ASU) of the Provisional IRA on 10 October 1981, using remote-controlled nail bomb. The bomb targeted a bus carrying British Army soldiers just outside Chelsea Barracks. The blast killed two civilians and injured 40 people, among them 23 soldiers.
Background.
In early October 1981, the Irish hunger strike, in which ten Irish Republican prisoners died, had just come to an end. The strike, started by Bobby Sands, was an attempt by the prisoners to have their political status reinstated. During the strike, Sands and another IRA volunteer, Kieran Doherty, were elected to the British and Irish parliaments respectively. The IRA resolved that action should be taken against the British Army or British Government to match the sacrifice made by the strikers.
Bombing.
An IRA's Active Service Unit (ASU) in London decided to target members of the British Army Irish Guards regiment and planned to bomb two bus loads of guards on 10 October, as they were entering Chelsea Barracks. The IRA unit assumed that would be a place where passing civilians were unlikely to get caught in the blast. The device, believed to be a remote-controlled bomb, was hidden in a laundry van near the barracks, close to the junction of Ebury Bridge Road and St. Barnabas Street.
The bomb was detonated as a single bus passed, carrying 23 Irish Guards. Two other bus loads of Irish Guards were travelling a few minutes behind the one that was hit, so it seems that the bombers missed their main target. Two civilians, Nora Field, 59 and John Breslin, 18, were killed in the blast, and 40 people were injured, 23 of them soldiers, eight of whom received severe injuries. It was the worst attack carried out by the IRA in England since the London Hilton bombing, which killed two civilians and injured over 60 others.
Aftermath.
The IRA said in a statement the day after the bombing from Dublin that "the attack was aimed at a party of British soldiers". The statement added:The attack is attributable to the state of war which exists between the British government who occupy Northern Ireland and the oppressed Irish people who strike out through the Irish Republican Army. We await the hypocrisy which will undoubtedly follow from British political leaders whose attitude to Irish victims of their violence in our country only strengthens our conviction in our cause and methods.
The IRA continued bombing targets in England. A week after the Chelsea bombing, the IRA seriously injured Lieutenant-General Sir Steuart Pringle when a booby-trap bomb exploded under his car. Pringle survived his injuries but lost his right leg. On 26 October 1981, Kenneth Howorth, a police explosives officer, was killed trying to defuse an IRA bomb placed in a Wimpy Bar in Oxford Street, London. A month later on 23 November 1981 a bomb exploded at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich injuring two people.
A year later, on 20 July 1982, two bombs killed 11 British soldiers, and injured 50 soldiers and civilians, during the Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings. This was the deadliest IRA attack against the British Army in England during The Troubles. In December 1983, six people were killed and 90 injured in London when an IRA car bomb exploded outside Harrods apartment store. The IRA's most notable attack in Britain during that period occurred in Brighton in October 1984, when five people were killed and dozens injured in the Brighton hotel bombing, which was an attempt to kill British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Convictions.
In 1986, Paul Kavanagh and Thomas Quigley, then aged 29, were given life sentences for the bombing in Chelsea, as well as the booby-trap bomb in Oxford Street. They were released in 1999 after the Good Friday Agreement.
INLA bombing attempt.
Four years after the Chelsea Barracks bombing, on 11 November 1985, the Irish Republican Socialist-Revolutionary paramilitary organization the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) again attempted to bomb Chelsea Barracks. An INLA unit placed three bombs right outside the barracks, each weighing about . They were packed with nuts and bolts designed to cause maximum damage, but all three bombs were found and defused before they went off. Patrick McLaughlin, from Derry, was arrested in 1986 over the bombing attempt and was sentenced to life imprisonment. McLaughlin claimed he was innocent that he was a victim of a miscarriage of justice. In the book "INLA: Deadly Divisions" Henry McDonald and Jack Holland wrote: "McLaughlin is almost certainly an innocent man ... His links to the bomb team seem to be no more than accidental". A campaign claiming his innocence gathered some momentum in the 1990s. He was released in 1999 as part of the Good Friday Agreement.

<doc id="56740880" url="?curid=56740880" title="Women in Zoroastrianism">
Women in Zoroastrianism

The role of women in the Zoroastrian and Parsi communities remains controversial and significant. Gender roles in the community have slowly been evolving as societal norms around them progress. 
Formal rights for women.
Formal institutions, such as laws and courts, have led women within this community to find themselves both at the center of a tradition and compromised by it. 
Role of trusts.
Within the Parsi community, religious spaces are managed and funded by charitable trusts. It is through this mechanism that Parsi women's rights in such religious spaces are determined within the Parsi community in India.
Parsi personal law.
Personal laws are those that apply only to a certain community, class, or group of people within India, often with reference to one's religion, faith, and caste. Such Personal Laws vary according to religion and as such there are Personal Laws for the Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and Parsi communities. 
The Parsi Personal Laws are dictated by the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act of 1936. The act was written and adopted on April 23, 1936, and later amended in 2001. Parsi Personal Laws only address marriage between two Parsis of the opposite sex. The main purpose of the Personal Laws are to outlaw child marriage, incest, and polygamy. 
The most notable articles within the act include Article 6 that requires for every marriage under the act to be registered. Article 32B dictates that divorce must be filed by both husband and wife on the ground of both parties living separately for a year or more, an inability to live together, and the mutual agreement of separation. Article 34 furthers this with the protocol that any married person can sue for a judicial separation on the same conditions that a divorce might be filed.
The Parsi Personal Laws function in accordance with the Special Marriage Act of 1954. This act states that it is compulsory for all marriages to be registered, regardless of the religious identity of the individuals involved. The two acts, while functioning together, are often at odds with one another with relation to intermarriage, and the validity of such marriages.
Inheritance law.
Parsi Laws of Inheritance dictate that any non-Parsi woman who is the wife, or widow, of a Parsi man cannot receive inheritance from their husbands. However, the children of such a couple, born to a non-Parsi mother and a Parsi father, are entitled to the inheritance of their fathers.
Intermarriage rights.
Intermarriage is the term used to refer to married couples that are of different religious faiths. More and more Parsis are marrying outside the community. Parsi woman marrying a non-parsi is allowed to enter the fire temple and participate in religious activities.
Before December 2017, a Parsi women who marries a non-Parsi man was automatically considered to have converted to the religion of her husband. She was forced to renunciate her identity as a Parsi. She no longer had access to the legal protections and religious spaces that are governed by the Parsi trusts. This included places of worship, known as Agyaris or fire temples, and sacred burial sites. On December 14, 2017 Supreme court overruled the verdict of High Court of Gujarat which stated the denial of parsi woman to enter fire temple. A parsi woman marrying a non-parsi is now allowed to enter the fire temple and tower of silence and participate in other religious activities. 
The children of an intermarriage can only be recognized as Parsi if their father is a Parsi and their mother is a non-Parsi. In the case that their father is a non-Parsi and their mother is a Parsi, they are not allowed to identify as Parsi nor be raised as such. Such children are, like their Parsi mothers post-marriage to a non-Parsi man, unable to enter the Agyaris nor be accepted into the faith group through the ritual, the Navjote.
Notable court cases.
There have been a series of judicial cases concerning women's rights within the Parsi community that have been escalated to the High Courts of India. Such cases have brought legal, media, and popular attention to progression towards greater rights for Parsi women. 
One such case is that of a Parsi women, Goolrukh Gupta, who married a Hindu man and was subsequently barred from entering all Parsi sacred spaces as an intermarried women. Gupta sued the local Parsi trust in her town of Valsad, Gujarat that imposed the restriction on her. Her case was soon escalated to the Gujarat High Court. Gupta made the case that she was married under the Special Marriage Act of 1956 and thus her civil marriage should be recognized in all communities. However, the High Court ruled in favor of the trust and Gupta remained a Hindu, and not a Parsi, in the eyes of the trust and legal system.
A second famous case is the Parsi Punchayet Case of 1909. In this case, Sir Dinshaw Petit sued the Bombay Parsi Panchayet (BPP). His case was that the funds from the BPP trust were being restricted from Parsi converts, as people who could also benefit from the offerings of the trust. In this case, Ratanji D. Tata and his wife, a born French woman, were both plaintiffs. Mrs. Tata had converted to the Parsi religion, and yet as a convert, the BPP barred her from entering any agiarys and disabled her from being buried in the sacred site, the Tower of Silence or the doongerwadi. Again, the High Court ruled in favor of the trust.
In a third case, in December 2017, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of women's rights. Despite both being married to non-Parsi men, two Parsi sisters were granted the right to attend their father's burial at the Tower of Silence. In this case, the Court ruled against the Mumbai Parsi trust that was banning both the women. The Court however, could not secure the right of the women to pray.
Informal rights for women.
Ritualized Spaces and traditions also influence the rights and role of women in the Zoroastrian community, in a more informal, yet pervasive, manner.
Ritual spaces.
In addition to legal restrictions, women in the Parsi community face restrictions in ritualized, religious spaces as well. One of the most notable examples of this is that women are often not allowed into the doongerwadi and other sacred burial grounds for Parsis throughout India.
Community spaces.
Parsi women also face discrimination in community spaces, such as social clubs. Many such clubs in Mumbai have adopted the British idea of a "gentleman's club" by only granting membership to males. One prominent example of this is the Ripon Club. Following backlash from the community, the Ripon Club began granting membership to females. Approximately 10% of their members are female, all of whom are considered to be "lady associate members". Such members must attain their membership either through a Parsi father or a Parsi husband who is a member. They do not have voting rights within the club.
In religious scripture.
The rights of women within the Parsi faith can be analyzed through scriptures and ancient Zoroastrian texts, such as the Avesta. However, the scriptures can be analyzed and perceived in many different ways. 
The result is two main camps of text interpreters - a liberal camp and an orthodox camp. Those who read the text with a liberal perspective state that the Parsi prophet, Zarathustra, has always addressed both men and women through his words and actions. The orthodox view states that no one who is half Parsi, whether male or female, born to a Parsi mother or father, should be considered to be a Parsi at all. These people believe that laws and access, even those that allow children born to Parsi fathers and non-Parsi mothers, should only be made more strict and restrictive.

Luis Argudo

Luis Argudo (born December 13, 1995) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a midfielder for Swedish club Norrby IF. He previously appeared at the semi-professional level for Carolina Dynamo, played professionally with Columbus Crew SC and Inter Miami, and spent time on loan with Hartford Athletic.
Argudo was born in New York City and attended Francis Lewis High School in Queens. He played two collegiate seasons at Elon University before transferring and playing his final two seasons at Wake Forest University, finishing as national runner-up with the Demon Deacons in 2016. He also appeared during the collegiate off-season with Carolina Dynamo. Columbus Crew SC drafted Argudo in the third round of the 2018 MLS SuperDraft; he eventually signed for the club almost two months later. After two seasons with the Crew, including his first professional goal, Argudo was selected by Inter Miami in the 2019 MLS Expansion Draft. He made just one appearance for Miami, then moved overseas the following year to join Swedish club Norrby IF. A native of the United States, Argudo is also eligible to play for the Colombian or Ecuadorian national teams through his parental heritage.
Early life.
Born in New York City, Argudo attended Francis Lewis High School in Fresh Meadows, Queens. He was a four-year varsity soccer player for the Patriots, finishing his prep career with 13 goals and 20 assists. At club level, he played for Albertson SC under Paul Riley. He also played for New York Ecuador in the NYC Futsal League.
Argudo committed to play college soccer at Elon, one of five members of the last recruiting class for head coach Darren Powell before his resignation.
College and amateur.
Argudo made his debut for new head coach Chris Little and Elon on August 29, 2014, starting against Stetson in the John Rennie/Nike Classic. He went on to appear 18 times as a freshman, starting 10 matches and tallying a goal and an assist. His first collegiate goal came on October 11, the third tally of a 5–0 victory over Northeastern. As a sophomore, Argudo appeared 21 times for an Elon team that was Colonial Athletic Association co-regular season champions and qualified for the NCAA Tournament for just the fourth time in the school's history. Although he did not score, he provided two assists during the season and started both NCAA Tournament matches. After two seasons, 39 games, and one goal for the Phoenix, Argudo transferred to Wake Forest.
Argudo debuted for the Demon Deacons on August 26, 2016, coming off the bench in a 1–0 defeat against Saint Louis. He worked his way into the starting lineup by September, tallying an assist against NC State in his first start for Wake Forest. Argudo scored for the first time in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, helping his team defeat Coastal Carolina 2–0. He tallied one goal in 25 appearances on the season as the Demon Deacons fell to Stanford in the national championship game. As a senior, Argudo had his best collegiate season: eight goals and six assists in 23 matches. He scored five times in the season's first four games, scored the game-winning goal against Elon on October 17, and converted during the penalty shootout in the ACC Tournament championship game. Argudo was named to the All-Atlantic Coast Conference Third Team following the season; he concluded his two seasons at Wake Forest with nine goals in 48 appearances.
Carolina Dynamo.
Before his senior season at Wake Forest, Argudo appeared for Premier Development League club Carolina Dynamo. He made his debut on May 25, 2017 in a 2–0 defeat against North Carolina FC U23. He found his scoring touch in the back half of the season, with goals on June 17 against Wilmington Hammerheads and on July 13 against Tobacco Road FC. Argudo finished with two goals from 10 appearances in his lone season with Carolina.
Club career.
Columbus Crew SC.
Initially, Argudo was not selected to take part in the 2018 MLS Combine; however, he was added to the Combine roster just two days before the event began after an injury to Drew Skundrich. On January 21, Columbus Crew SC drafted Argudo with the 67th overall pick of the 2018 MLS SuperDraft. After taking part in the team's preseason camp, he officially signed with Columbus on March 1. Argudo made his professional debut just two days later, replacing Pedro Santos in the 77th minute of a season-opening victory against Toronto FC, the defending MLS Cup champions. He missed three matches in April due to a MCL sprain but returned to the pitch on May 9 to earn his first start of the season in a victory over Philadelphia Union. Argudo went on to appear 21 times across all competitions in his rookie season, including two appearances in the 2018 MLS Cup Playoffs. The club picked up his contract option on December 9, 2018.
2019: Loan to Hartford.
After making just one appearance in Columbus through the first two months of the season, Argudo was sent on loan to USL Championship club Hartford Athletic on April 11, 2019. He was joined in Hartford by Crew teammate Jon Kempin. Argudo made his club debut two days later, starting and playing 90 minutes in a 4–1 defeat against Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC. After appearing just once more for Hartford, he was recalled by the Crew on April 23. He broke into the Columbus lineup over the summer with the club shorthanded due to injuries and international duty, going on to make 23 appearances for the Crew in all competitions. On July 17, Argudo provided his first MLS assist during a draw against Chicago Fire; ten days later, he scored his first professional goal as part of a 3–2 victory over New York Red Bulls. After finishing the season with one goal and three assists across 25 matches with both clubs, Argudo had his contract option picked up by the Crew.
Inter Miami.
After being left unprotected by Columbus, Argudo was selected by Inter Miami with the seventh overall pick of the 2019 MLS Expansion Draft. He made his debut, and his lone appearance for the club, during the group stage of the MLS is Back Tournament. He played 11 minutes off the bench in a defeat against Orlando City. Argudo was waived by Miami on September 5, having appeared on the bench just four other times outside of his one appearance. At the end of the season, he was not selected in the 2020 MLS Re-Entry Draft.
Norrby IF.
Ahead of the 2021 season, Argudo went on trial in Major League Soccer (MLS) with expansion club Austin FC. He scored the first unofficial goal in the club's history, coming in a friendly against OKC Energy on March 19, and remained in Austin through the beginning of the 2021 MLS season. However, at the end of April he was released without a contract. He moved to Sweden in May to train with IK Sirius, but again did not earn a permanent contract. Argudo ended his search for a club on June 17, signing with Superettan club Norrby IF on a one-year deal with an option for two further seasons.
Personal life.
Argudo was born in the United States to a Colombian mother and an Ecuadorian father. He lived in Ecuador as a child and possesses passports from all three countries. He has expressed interest in representing either Colombia or Ecuador saying, "If there is an opportunity, obviously one would accept the possibilities when they arrive."

Ja'Tovia Gary

Ja'Tovia M. Gary is an American artist and filmmaker based in Brooklyn, New York.
Biography and career.
Gary was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, in a Pentecostal church community. Before becoming a filmmaker, Gary pursued a professional career in acting, but she soon became disheartened by the reductive roles and characters that she was offered in the film industry. In "Filmmaker" magazine, Gary described this disillusionment as an impetus for her shift from acting to filmmaking: "I was getting debasing roles. In "Grand Theft Auto IV", I was the voice of a drug dealer's battered girlfriend, and you as a player would opt to save me or not. I wanted control over my image."
Gary's work seeks to liberate the distorted histories through which Black life is often viewed, while fleshing out a nuanced and multivalent Black interiority. Through documentary film, archival footage, and experimental video art, Gary charts the ways in which structures of power shape our perceptions around representation, race, gender, sexuality, and violence. Gary has also focused on themes such as black feminist subjectivity and has confronted the often painful history of these subjects by featuring archival footage in her work. In conversation with Michael B. Gillespie, a film theorist and historian at the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University, Gary describes her process:I am simultaneously creating and destroying, remaking and unmaking. My intimate interaction with the archive... expresses my desire to be a part of it, to make my presence felt in and on that history while also interrogating it.Gillespie notes that "Gary renders film blackness as cinema in the wake, an assemblage of work that poses new circuits and aesthetic accountings of blackness, sociality, and obliteration."
In June 2013, Gary was among the founding members of the New Negress Film Society, a collective of black women filmmakers that seeks to create a community and raise awareness of black female voices and stories in the film industry.
Gary earned her MFA in Social Documentary Filmmaking at the School of Visual Arts. She also completed a Dual Bachelor of Arts in Documentary Film Production and Africana Studies at Brooklyn College. Gary also holds a Documentary Filmmaking Certificate from the LV Prasad Academy in Chennai, India.
The artist's professional production credits include post-production and archival assistant for Spike Lee's "Bad 25" and Shola Lynch's "Free Angela" and "All Political Prisoners", as well as assistant editor on "Jackie Robinson", a two-part biographical documentary directed by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns, and David McMahon, which premiered April 2016 on PBS.
She has taught at The New School and Mono No Aware in New York City.
Gary was a 2018–2019 Radcliffe-Harvard Film Study Center fellow at Harvard University. She is represented by the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York, and by the Galerie Frank Elbaz in Paris.
Exhibitions.
Gary's work has been screened internationally at venues such as the Ann Arbor Film Festival, the Edinburgh International Film Festival, Frameline, the New Orleans Film Festival, Gdansk Animation Festival, BlackStar Film Festival, and Tampere Film Festival. Gary's work has been exhibited at cultural institutions worldwide, including the Brooklyn Museum, The Kitchen in New York City, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, MoMA PS1, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Museum of Modern Art, among others.
In 2020, Los Angeles's Hammer Museum and the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York each presented Gary's experimental film "The Giverny Document".
Awards.
Gary's work has earned her a Creative Capital award, as well as support from DOC Society, the Jerome Foundation, and Sundance Institute. In 2016, Gary participated in the Terra Summer Residency program, in Giverny, France.
In 2017, Gary was named one of the 25 New Faces of Independent Filmmaking in "Filmmaker" Magazine.
Permanent collections.
Gary's work is held in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Art, Design &amp; Architecture Museum of UC Santa Barbara, Studio Museum of Harlem, and, the Memorial Art Gallery. Gary's work is part of The On February 26, 2018, the Whitney released a video by artist Shellyne Rodriguez where she responds and discusses Gary's film "An Ecstatic Experience".

Vanuatu Labor Corps

The Vanuatu Labor Corps was a labour unit of the United States Armed Forces consisting of New Hebrides natives. The unit was established in 1942 and dissolved in 1945. During its service it provided crucial logistical support to the Allied war effort during the Guadalcanal Campaign. It was jointly led by Major George Riser and Thomas Beatty, while its size fluctuated between 1,000 and 10,000 men.
Background.
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States officially entered the Pacific War on the side of the Allies. In an attempt to halt the rapid Japanese expansion southward, which threatened Australia's marine communication lines, American troops occupied the Anglo-French New Hebrides Condominium in early 1942. The first American troops landed on Efate in March, establishing joint rule with the colonial authorities. In May, the construction of a large airfield was initiated amidst the arrival of reinforcements. American military facilities were erected in Port Vila, Port Havannah and Espiritu Santo. Those included eight coastwatching stations, ammunition depots, airfields, ports, encampments and water supply systems. They played an important role as a transit point for the transportation of military equipment and the evacuation of wounded personnel during the course of the Guadalcanal Campaign. At the peak of the campaign Espiritu Santo became the second-largest American base in the Pacific, housing 40,000 people. By 1943, the New Hebrides had lost much of their strategic importance and the bases shifted their focus to rear line support.
Service.
The arising situation necessitated the recruitment of indigenous Ni-Vanuatu population into a labor unit. At first, the Americans used the colonial authorities as middlemen during the hiring process as they had previously done with Solomon Islands Labour Corps and the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit. However frequent disagreements between the French and the British in combination with complaints from the laborers regarding the quality of the food they were served, prompted the Americans to assume control. By the end of 1942, the Vanuatu Labor Corps numbered 1,000 people who worked three-month-long tours each. Once the labor resources of Efate had been exhausted recruits started coming from Tanna, Ambae and smaller islands eventually swelling the unit's numbers to 10,000 men. Workers were separated into 20-man groups, led by a single person who could speak the local language, Bislama. Those were divided between the US Army and US Navy, and supervised by Major George Riser and Thomas Beatty respectively.
While the recruits had to build their own huts for accommodation, other necessities such as food, clothing, dogtags, medical care and cigarettes were provided for them by the American military. Workers were paid 7.50 USD per month, with the wages purposefully lowered as colonial authorities feared post-war inflation. They also imposed restrictions on the attire, eating habits, length of contracts, the number of workers and their interactions with foreigners. Those were dropped once the Americans took over the unit's management. The men normally worked 10-hour days, with a single day off every 14 days. Tasks performed included stevedoring, mosquito eradication, hospital work and supply delivery. Although no member of the corps died in combat, deaths from disease, work-related accidents and overwork were not uncommon. The formation was dissolved following the departure of the Americans from the island in 1945. The mass participation of Ni-Vanuatu men in the Labor Corps had a significant effect on the John Frum movement, giving it the characteristics of a cargo cult.

Vogelinsel (Lake Constance)

The Vogelinsel is an island in Lake Constance with an area of around 600 square metres. It lies around 230 metres northwest of the mouth of the Leiblach opposite the "Gemarkung" of Reutin of the town of Lindau. On the island is the red mole beacon at the harbour entrance of the marina in Lindau-Zech. The island has been designated as a bird reserve.
According to "BayernAtlas", the Vogelinsel does not belong to any plot of land or any "Gemarkung" and thus does not belong to the borough of Lindau. It is therefore not incorporated, but nevertheless is part of German territory, as it lies within the "Halde", the area of Lake Constance up to a water depth of 25 metres.
Nearby island.
Another, even smaller, unnamed island () is located about 900 metres north of the aforementioned Vogelinsel, only about 50 metres west of the shore of the mainland. This island is also not incorporated and is roughly south of the "Villa Leuchtenberg". It is an island under normal conditions. When the lake level rises only a tree rises above the water. At low water, there is a causeway to the nearby shore.

Running Wild (1954 TV series)

Running Wild was a comedy sketch show originally broadcast by BBC television, the first TV series by English comedy double-act Morecambe and Wise. The first attempt by the pair at a television series, it aired for a single series of six episodes in 1954. "Running Wild" was Morecambe &amp; Wise's first collaboration with Ernest Maxin, who subsequently worked with the duo on their second BBC television show.
History.
From the late 1940s onwards, Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise had been steadily building a reputation for their comedy on the national variety circuit. In September 1951, the duo made their first appearance on television with a guest spot on a BBC show called "Parade of Youth", while they began making regular appearances on BBC Radio, first as semi-regular participants on "Variety Fanfare", and then with their own show, "You're Only Young Once", on the BBC Northern Home Service. The success that they began to achieve through their appearances on radio, combined with guest appearances on television, eventually led to the BBC offering them a television series of their own.
Ronnie Waldman, the head of BBC Light Entertainment, was in the process of attempting to devise an idea of television variety programming, rather than televising stage based variety. As part of this, he sought to sign up acts that could adapt to the demands of working on television, which required a huge amount of material. In 1953, Morecambe &amp; Wise made an appearance on the television show "Stars in Blackpool", which led to them meeting Waldman, who started forming plans for the duo to headline their own television series. However, although the duo had performed in Southern England on the variety circuit, their broadcasting career had largely taken place in Northern England, which led BBC producers to suggest that their act might not work with southern audiences. Bryan Sears, who was assigned as the new show's producer, eventually attached a group of six writers to the production, which received the title "Running Wild". The series was given an initial run of six episodes, to be broadcast live fortnightly from the BBC Television Theatre in Shepherd's Bush.
Reception.
Following the broadcast of the first episode, the reviews were poor, with the most notable coming from Kenneth Bailey in the People on Sunday 25 April;
Such was the impact of that review that Eric Morecambe carried a copy of it with him for the rest of his life. The poor reception that the first show received, combined with only minor improvements in the quality for the second and third episodes, led to Morecambe and Wise suggesting to Ronnie Waldman that the remainder of the series be cancelled. In spite of their reservations, Waldman remained steadfast in his confidence in the duo and the production, and it eventually ran for the full six episodes. The Reaction Index, an indicator of the audience's approval of a television programme, given as a score out of 100, had slowly increased over the course of the series, while the reviews had improved. Nevertheless, the criticism that the duo had personally received meant that their personal morale and enthusiasm had evaporated by the end of the run.
Aftermath.
Following the conclusion of "Running Wild", Morecambe and Wise returned to the variety circuit. Unlike with the television show, where they had had little influence over the writing or direction of what appeared on the screen, when they appeared on stage, the duo had full control of their material and routines. Their initial appearances after their television experience were uniformly positive; their first post-television appearance, at the Ardwick Hippodrome in Manchester, which came after a period where they had re-written their act, saw them receive a standing ovation. Their initial success led to further variety bookings and a return to radio. Two years after the failure of "Running Wild", Morecambe &amp; Wise were invited to do a series of guest spots on "The Winifred Atwell Show" on ATV. These were successful enough to lead to guest appearances on other television shows, followed by a six-month tour of Australia in 1958. On their return, with a realisation that live variety was on the wane and television was becoming more popular, they decided to focus on TV work, with a view eventually to having their own series. They would eventually achieve this in 1961 when they were signed to ATV and began work on "Two of a Kind".
Archive status.
"Running Wild" was broadcast live, with no telerecording made. Although the ITV3 tribute series "Morecambe &amp; Wise Forever" displayed an original script from "Running Wild" which stated that it was to be recorded, there is no evidence of whether this occurred and, if so, that any copy survived.
In 2011, the BBC broadcast "Eric and Ernie", a dramatization of the early years of Morecambe and Wise's career written by Victoria Wood. This told the duo's story up to their return to variety following their first television series, and featured recreations of several scenes from "Running Wild".

Cima volcanic field

Cima volcanic field is a volcanic field in San Bernardino County, California, close to the border with Nevada. The volcanic field covers a surface area of within the Mojave National Preserve west of the Cima Dome and consists of about 40 volcanic cones with about 60 lava flows. The volcanic cones range from simple cones over multi-cratered mountains to eroded hills, and lava flows are up to long. At least one lava tube exists in the field and can be visited.
Volcanic activity in the field commenced in the Late Miocene and after a pause between 3 and 1 million years ago continued into the latest Pleistocene. The youngest cone is known as the Black Tank cone and formed about 15,000 years before present, although it is possible that it was formed through two separate eruption events; formerly it was considered to be of historical age.
Geography and geology.
The Cima volcanic field lies in the eastern Mojave Desert of California, between the Shadow Valley in the northeast, the Cima Dome in the east and the Soda Lake Valley in the southwest. Southwest of the field is Kelbaker Road which crosses some lava flows, and dirt roads such as the Indian Springs Trail and the Aiken Mine Road crisscross between the volcanoes.
Interstate 15 passes north of the field and just south of older volcanic units, while California State Route 127 runs west and southwest of the field, The city of Las Vegas is northeast of the area. The Cima volcanoes are part of the Mojave National Preserve and since 1973 they make up the Cinder Cones National Natural Landmark.
During the Holocene and until recent times, humans engraved petroglyphs into the lava flows. One cinder cone was quarried to obtain materials for road construction. The volcanic field has been the subject of soil sciences and landscape development research.
Regional.
Volcanism is widespread in the western United States and occurs in various forms at various places. Among the better known are the Cascade volcanoes created by subduction off the western coast of North America, which include the caldera of Mount Mazama (created by a large eruption in the early Holocene) as well as stratovolcanoes such as Mount St. Helens and mafic volcanic fields. Other volcanic centres in the United States are those associated with Yellowstone Caldera and Snake River Plain, those along the margins of the Colorado Plateau, volcanoes linked to the Rio Grande Rift and Jemez lineament, and finally volcanoes in the western Basin and Range Province such as the Cima volcanic field.
Generally, volcanic activity was widespread in the dry regions of the western United States during the Tertiary and Quaternary, forming several volcanic fields. An earlier phase of felsic volcanism during the Tertiary was followed during the Quaternary by more basaltic volcanism, often in the form of short-lived volcanic vents. Examples of this kind of volcanism are the Cima volcanic field, the San Francisco volcanic field (Arizona), the Southwest Nevada volcanic field (Nevada) and the Zuni-Bandera volcanic field (New Mexico).
The Cima volcanic field is part of the Mojave Desert, which in turn belongs to the Basin and Range Province and features both mountains exceeding height which trend in southeast–northwest direction, with broad valleys between the mountains.
Local.
There are about 40 cones in the Cima volcanic field. The cones are as much as wide and high, and are concentrated between elevations of on a south-southwest tilting slope. Some cones are well preserved with intact craters, while others have been reduced to hills by erosion. Some cones have more than one crater. North of the main field lie two outcrops of older volcanic rocks (Miocene to Pliocene); other than this separate older outcrop volcanic activity appears to have occurred without any preferential alignment. Several washes such as Willow Wash, Black Tank Wash and Indian Creek cross through the field and have eroded lava flows.
The youngest cone () in the southwestern part of the field is called Black Tank cone. The Black Tank cone is the source of a long lava flow, which at first forms a levee-bound channel and then narrows out into a lobate shape. It also shows traces of a lava tube and has a volume of . This flow may have been preceded by a previous lava flow which was later buried by the main flow. An older vent lies just south-southwest of the Black Tank Cone.
The field presents black and red volcanic rocks in the form of cinders, exposed feeder dykes and lava bombs, as well as agglutinates which are exposed in gullies and eroded vents. Bombs and cinders cover the less eroded cones, which are also sometimes surrounded by base surge deposits. At some vents, tuff rings formed through phreatomagmatic activity. Erosion has dug gullies and larger valleys in the older cones, including one deep gorge.
Volcanic material covers a surface area of about within an area of . The volcanic field was emplaced on a basement of Tertiary age, which comprises both crystalline bedrock and thick gravel deposits. Other rock formations in the area are of ProterozoicPaleozoic to Mesozoic (Teutonia batholith) age, and the region is considered to be part of the Ivanpah uplift.
Lava flows.
The cones have given rise to about 60 lava flows. Lava flows reach lengths of , thicknesses of and have surface features similar to pahoehoe or aa lava depending on how steep the slopes they flowed down were. The lava flows display structures like levees, finger-like and lobe-like edges at the lava flow margins, spines and spires and material from the cones that was rafted away by the lavas. One can distinguish between long, gently sloping flows which dominate the field, and shorter, steeper rougher flows covered by blocks with sizes of up to . One major lava tube lies in the Cima field and is accessible through a skylight; it is long and wide. In some places flows surrounded basement outcrops, forming kipukas. In accordance to the slope of the area, most lavas flowed westward.
Younger flows often show crisp lava flow features while older flows are almost always mantled with younger material and have lost their original surface features. The oldest flows have flat or gentle surfaces and their source vents are heavily degraded. Lava flows are also in part covered by wind-transported or erosional material and desert varnish.
Composition.
The field has erupted alkali basalt, basanite and hawaiite. Phenocrysts include clinopyroxene, olivine and plagioclase. There are also xenoliths including dunite, gabbro, granite, and notably ultramafic to mafic xenoliths. The rock composition has not changed much during the history of the Cima volcanoes. Temperatures of have been estimated for the lava erupted by the Black Tank cone.
The magma erupted in the field ultimately appears to originate from the lithospheric or asthenospheric mantle with little contribution of crustal components, unlike earlier felsic volcanism. Upwelling of asthenosphere material appears to be responsible for the volcanism at the end, possibly associated with the change in the tectonics of the region from subduction-dominated to tectonics of a transform boundary. Fractional crystallization, magma ponding in the crust, differences in the mantle sources and partial melting processes have been invoked to explain certain compositional differences in the erupted rocks.
Climate and vegetation.
The climate of the area is warm and dry with average temperatures of and average precipitation amounting to . Most precipitation falls during winter, with only small amounts of rain falling during summer as monsoonal rainfall. Before the beginning of the Holocene, the climate was wetter and this facilitated the development of soils on lava flows. During the Holocene, playas became sources for wind-blown dust which accumulates on the lava.
Vegetation in the area is classified as scrub, with plants including brittle bush, creosote bush, Mormon tea and white bursage. Joshua trees grow at higher elevations. Some of these species arrived during the Holocene, while others became established during the Pleistocene or appeared and disappeared repeatedly. Vegetation grows in clusters separated by soil covered by desert pavement. The youngest cone is unvegetated and little vegetation has developed on other recent volcanic vents and lava flows.
Eruptive history.
Early research postulated a Pleistocene age for the northern part of the field and a Holocene age for the southern; later radiometric dates indicated Miocene ages for the northern parts of the field. More recent research showed Miocene ages for the northern volcanics and Pleistocene ages for the southern. An eruption rate of 8 events per 100,000 years and a magma output of has been estimated for the Cima field.
According to potassium-argon dating, volcanic activity started in the Miocene and continued to the end of the Pleistocene. Activity has been subdivided into five phases, the first between 7.6 and 6.5 million years ago, the second between 5.1 and 3.6 million years ago, the third between 1.1 and 0.6 million years ago, the fourth between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago and the fifth and last between 200,000 and 10,000 years ago. The radiometric ages have been corroborated by morphological and paleomagnetic information. Volcanic activity paused between 3 and 1 million years ago.
The oldest volcanic phase left a heavily dissected volcano in the southeastern part of the field, while the subsequent phase involved lava flows in the northern part of the field that take the form of eroded mesas. The final three phases formed lava flows and the volcanoes in the southern part of the field. Eruptions commenced as maar-forming eruptions and continued with the growth of cinder cones and lava flows. Unlike regular cinder cones which usually erupt only once, some cones at Cima experienced more than one eruption and were active over hundreds of thousands of years.
The Black Tank cone, the youngest cone in the field, has been dated to 15,000 ± 5,000 years before present by several methods. Some evidence suggested a historical age for one of the southern lava flows, with earlier radiocarbon dating yielding an age of 330–480 years. Several chronological data imply that the lava flow was formed during two separate eruptive episodes, one 20,000 years ago and the other 11,500 - 13,000 years ago. The lava flow was probably laid down in less than a week of time, and the growth of the cone was influenced by wind, which transported tephra east-southeastwards where it fell out and formed a tephra blanket.

Shen Yuan

Shen Yuan (; born 1959 in Xianyou, Fujian), is a Chinese-born French artist. She graduated from China Academy of Art in 1982, and then started to practice in the Xiamen Dada group, an artists group that is known for exploring radical avant-garde art in Southern China. She moved to Paris, France with her husband Huang Yong Ping after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.
As a contemporary artist, Shen Yuan's art often reflects on Chinese cultural and political realities. She has strong messages of feminism and gender roles in her artworks. Topics include issues such as labor (child labor, women workers), slums, and social conflicts. Her artistic process often makes use of on-the-spot investigations and local creative methods to work together with local children or people to complete the work.
She has been featured in many exhibitions. Her and her husband's works were featured in Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's group exhibition "Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World", and in exhibition "Hong Kong Foot" at Tang Contemporary Art in Hong Kong.
Early life.
Shen Yuan was born to a family of artists. She took up painting under encouragement from her father. In the new art movement known as '85, the artists of Xiamen Dada engaged in contemporary art within the context of a tense political climate. In 1990, Shen Yuan and her husband Huang Yong Ping left China and resettled in Paris. In this city vibrant with artistic activity, they encountered a newly found creative freedom. Nonetheless, the displacement presented a new host of challenges including cultural confrontation, language barriers, and the pressures of life in a new environment.
Art works.
Having moved to Paris, Shen Yuan's works often discuss the topics of immigration experience, identity, travel and life. The identity of immigrants prompted her to enter a new phase of creativity. When she first arrived in Paris, she lived in an old abandoned hospital. Because of the language barrier, she could not express her thoughts or defend herself. This experience of isolation was encapsulated in the sole work of the exhibition "Perdre sa salive" (1994), where nine tongues made of ice were mounted on the walls. After the ice melt, the knives buried inside appeared—the soft tongue became a dangerous weapon, just as language could cause harm.
The symbol of the tongue in Shen Yuan's work has multiple layers of meanings. Conceptually, it is dualistic—both material as part of the body, and spiritual as an instrument to express the mind. “In my creation, the tongue is more representative of the latter, namely language and tools. I like ice as a material because it has a fragile and easily melting side, but when you hold it in your hand, it is biting.” Visually, it is in the process of constant change and instability.
Personal life.
Shen Yuan is married to the renowned contemporary artist, Huang Yong Ping. They have carried out a number of collaborative projects. "We both have a strong personality, but we understand and support each other." When asked about her husband in an interview, Shen Yuan said, “When we first came to Paris, we decided not to have children. But then some years later, I felt the urge of wanting a kid." They have a daughter, born in 1995.

The demographics are changing.

Locomotives SFAI 301-311

Locomotives SFAI 301-311 of the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) were a group of steam locomotives derived from the rebuilding of some machines in the 31-80 series.
History.
The machines, built by Stephenson in 1857-1858 with a wheel arrangement, were modified with the installation of a new firebox. At the same time the wheel arrangement was modified to to provide greater adhesive weight. Between 1877 and 1882, six engines were rebuilt and numbered 292 to 297. Between 1884 and 1885, four more engines were rebuilt and one new one was purchased. The entire group was then renumbered as 301-311.
Ownership change.
In 1885, with the creation of the great national networks, the machines were incorporated into the stock of the Rete Adriatica, which classified them as class 110 with numbers 1101-1111. They were all scrapped before 1905, so they did not transfer to the Ferrovie dello Stato.

Lola Pashalinski

Lola Pashalinski is an American theatre artist known for her work as a founding member of Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company.
Early life.
Born Regina Hirsch in Brooklyn, New York, her father was an insurance salesman. Pashalinski spent her young adulthood "bounc[ing] around from odd job to odd job 'mostly in publishing' and briefly attended college before dropping out."
Career.
Pashalinski became involved in theatre as an assistant director with John Vaccaro's Playhouse of the Ridiculous, a resident company at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, during the 1960s. She left the Playhouse of the Ridiculous with Ludlam when he and John Vaccarro had a disagreement during rehearsals for "Conquest of the Universe" in 1967.
Ludlam then founded his Ridiculous Theatrical Company, and Pashalinski was a founding member, working with the company from its establishment in 1967 until 1980. During those years, she appeared in 17 of the company's productions, including as Lola Lola in "Corn" (1973), Brunhilde in "Der Ring Gott Farblonjet" (1977), and Miss Cubbidge in "Bluebeard" (1970). Black-Eyed Susan, Mario Montez, and John Brockmeyer also performed in that production of "Bluebeard", which took place at La MaMa. Mary Brecht and Leandro Katz did design for the production. She also performed alongside Black-Eyed Susan, Brockmeyer, and Ethyl Eichelberger in Eichelberger's "Phedre and Oedipus" at La MaMa in 1977.
After leaving the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Pashalinski appeared in a range of theatrical productions and in film and television. In 1981, she played the jester Trinculo in "The Tempest", directed by Lee Breuer at Central Park's Delacorte Theater. She then worked with Richard Foreman, appearing in his 1983 production of "Egyptology (My Head Was a Sledgehammer)" at The Public Theater and his 1987 production of "Film is Evil, Radio Is Good" at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She performed in Tom Eyen's "Give My Regards to Off-Off-Broadway" at La MaMa in 1987. 
She also worked several times with director/choreographer David Gordon, appearing in his 1983 collaboration with JoAnne Akalitis and Philip Glass, "The Photographer", at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, his 1992 production of "The Mysteries And What's So Funny" at the Joyce Theater, also with music by Glass, and his 1996 production of "Punch and Judy Get Divorced". In 1999, she portrayed Gordon in his "Autobiography of a Liar" at Danspace Project. 
She also appeared in film and television, including as the psychiatrist in Mary Harron's "I Shot Andy Warhol", as Narc in Peter Sellar's "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez", as Mona Black in "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close", as Hedy Wormenhoven on "One Life to Live", and in smaller roles in All Good Things, "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd", and "The Equalizer".
In 1999, she and her partner Linda Chapman performed in a play they wrote called "Gertrude &amp; Alice: A Likeness to Loving", based on the relationship between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. "I've always loved Gertrude Stein and felt that as a gay woman, I understood her in a way that many biographers did not," Pashalinski told journalist Simi Horowitz for a profile published in "Backstage" in 2005. "I wanted to explode the myth of what Stein was about... and the play gave me the chance to work with Linda."
Awards.
Pashalinski won Obie Awards for Distinguished Performance by an Actress for her performances in the Ridiculous Theatrical Company productions "Corn" (1973) and "Der Ring Gott Farblonjet" (1977), and for her performance in "Gertrude &amp; Alice" (2000).

Night Bird Flying

"Night Bird Flying" is a rock song written by Jimi Hendrix. It is a complex piece with multiple guitar parts and reflects a variety of styles. Lyrically, Hendrix continues to explore an idealized feminine figure, as in his 1967 song "Little Wing".
Hendrix recorded the piece in the summer of 1970 at his new Electric Lady Studios with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Billy Cox. He proposed the song for his fourth album and it is one of the few that are seen as largely complete. "Night Bird Flying" was initially released on the first Hendrix posthumous album, "The Cry of Love" (1971). The song is included on several subsequent Hendrix compilations.
Composition and recording.
Hendrix used elements of the song's rhythm pattern in jams at TTG Studios in Los Angeles in October 1968. In early 1969, he started to develop it as "Ships Passing in the Night" and several demos were recorded before Hendrix attempted a proper recording in his newly built Electric Lady Studios on June 16, 1970. After 32 takes, he completed the master. Overdubs were recorded on July 19 and August 22, before a final mix was accomplished on August 24, 1970. Hendrix and all involved in the recording were very pleased with the song and it was presented on the opening party of Electric Lady on August 26.
Releases.
The song was chosen as a B-side for "Dolly Dagger" and a master for a single was prepared by Reprise Records. However, the single was cancelled when Hendrix died on September 18, 1970. In 1971, the song was included on the posthumous Hendrix album, "The Cry of Love". In the UK, it was released as the single B-side to "Angel" on Track Records. Later, the song was included on "Voodoo Soup" (1995) and "First Rays of the New Rising Sun" (1997), which were further attempts to present Hendrix's planned but unreleased fourth studio album. An alternate version appears on the 2000 box set "The Jimi Hendrix Experience".
Critical reception.
Critic Matthew Greenwald, in a song review for AllMusic, called "Night Bird Flying" "[a]nother great example of Jimi Hendrix utilizing his Electric Lady recording studios as a composing tool", due to Hendrix's numerous guitar overdubs. He added that "[t]he song ends with a rousing, in-studio jam that again finds Hendrix capable of intertwining guitar lines with a dizzying symbiosis."

At the Stage Door

At the Stage Door, also known by its working title Women of Conquest, is a 1921 silent American romantic drama film directed by Christy Cabanne. It stars Billie Dove, Huntley Gordon, and Miriam Battista, and was released on December 11, 1921. The film gives a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes reality of life in the New York theater, as seen by a small town girl trying to make it in the big city. The picture received mixed reviews. This was Dove's first time on film, having moved over from the Ziegfeld Follies.
Plot.
Mary Matthews is the elder sister of Helen, who is the favorite of their widowed mother. Growing up, she continually has to accede to Helen's wants and preferences. However, when the selfish Helen steals Mary's fiancé, Mary leaves home to try and make a life in New York City. She gets a part as a chorus girl in a Broadway production, but refuses to give in to the wanton lifestyle so prevalent among the other dancers. One night she is being pursued by the stage manager to join the gang in going out to one of their parties, but she keeps refusing. The stage manager becomes more and more aggressive, until he is on the verge of forcing her to accompany him. Mary is saved by the intervention of Philip Pierce, the heir of a socially prominent family, who punches out the stage manager.
The two become friends, and there is a growing attraction. However, at the insistence of his friends, who feel that "all chorus girls are alike", Philip makes a dishonorable proposition to her. Afterwards he realizes his mistake and apologizes, and the two reignite their mutual attraction. He eventually proposes to her, and tells her that the following evening he will meet her and present her with an engagement ring.
However, he fails to show up at the rendezvous, and in the papers the next morning there is an announcement of his engagement to a wealthy socialite. Mary is crushed. That night, despondent over being let down once again, she is on the verge of giving in and accompanying "the gang" on one of their licentious evenings out. Philip arrives just in time to prevent her from making a mistake. He explains that he missed the rendezvous because he indeed went to see his fiancée, who had arrived home unexpectedly from Europe. But he went to see her to break off their engagement, so that he could marry Mary. Unfortunately, Philip's mother jumped the gun on the wedding announcement. The two are reconciled and are married.
Production.
Having left the Ziegfeld Follies shortly before, this was Billie Dove's film debut. Most of the film was shot on several sets at Robertson-Cole's West 61st Street studio in New York City, while several scenes were shot on location inside the Park Theatre, as well as outside of its stage door. The working title of the film was "Women of Conquest". During filming in November, dozens of members of the press were invited on set to watch the shooting of one of the scenes. One scene shot on location in the Park Theatre included the use of over 600 extras as audience members. The film was released on December 11, 1921.
Reception.
"Exhibitors Herald" gave the picture a positive review, calling it "A rapidly moving and interesting story of a small town girl who has to give up everything for her more favored sister, and her adventures and misadventures after becoming a chorus girl." They called it one of Cabanne's best films, and praised the overall casting of the movie. They highlighted Billie Dove's acting as "brilliant", and also were impressed with Miriam Battista. They were less impressed by the cinematography, which they described as simply adequate. "Variety", on the other hand, was less impressed with the picture, while finding the photography "exceptionally good." They felt the picture was over-melodramatic, and the ending somewhat farcical, lowering the overall quality of the entire film. They felt the supporting cast was adequate, but they were impressed with the comedic talents of Doris Eaton. "Motion Picture News" took the opposite view, holding that Cabanne's vision of New York theater life had "... all the piquancy of theatrical life to fascinate the picture public, and it has also wholesome and at times gripping drama, and plenty of human interest drama." They felt that Cabanne did not give the stereotypical picture of backstage life, but a more realistic interpretation. They felt that the cast was "well-nigh perfect" in their performances, particularly highlighting the work of Billie Dove, stating "... an actress with exactly the wistful, appealing expression needed for such a part." Their overall impression was that the film was a "delightful, absorbing story of theatrical life."

How Do You Live? (film)

 is an upcoming Japanese animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli. The film is named after the 1937 novel written by Yoshino Genzaburo.
Premise.
The film centers around how the real-world novel "How Do You Live?" features prominently in the protagonist's life.
Production.
Miyazaki commenced animation work in July 2016, later confirmed by studio executive Toshio Suzuki. With Miyazaki coming out of retirement, Studio Ghibli re-opened with many of the past collaborators working on the project.
In October 2017, Studio Ghibli announced the film will be titled "How Do You Live?". Toshio Suzuki said that Miyazaki is working on the film for his grandson as his way of saying "Grandpa is moving onto the next world soon but he is leaving behind this film".
A release date has not been announced, although the film was at one point intended to be released near the time of the 2020 Summer Olympics.
Suzuki said in August 2018 the projections were for 2021 or 2022 completion. In a late 2019 interview with NHK, Miyazaki stated that the film is not to be expected anytime soon; he said that in his younger age he used to produce 10 minutes of animation every month, but now his speed is reduced to 1 minute per month. As of October 2019, the film was confirmed to be 15% complete. In May 2020, Suzuki told "Entertainment Weekly" that 60 animators were working on the film; an estimated 36 minutes of the film had been completed after three years of production. Suzuki said, "we are still hand-drawing everything, but it takes us more time to complete a film because we're drawing more frames" and they are "hoping it will finish in the next three years." In December 2020, Suzuki stated that the film was working with no deadlines, similar to "The Tale of the Princess Kaguya" (2013) which took eight years to make. He said that the animation was half-finished with production running faster, due to COVID-19 restrictions requiring them to work at home, and the film will be 125 minutes long. He also revealed that Miyazaki wanted to adapt "Earwig and the Witch" (2021) while he was developing "How Do You Live?". His son Gorō Miyazaki took the helm of "Earwig"s adaptation and directed it.

100th Anniversary of the Estonian Republic

The 100th Anniversary of the Estonian Republic (or more commonly used Estonia 100) is an official government program for the celebration of the Republic of Estonia's 100th anniversary. The official anniversary was marked on 24 February 2018, while related celebrations and events took place from April 2017 to February 2020.
Historical background.
On 12 February 1919, the Estonian Provisional Government decided to consider 24 February to be the date of the independence of Estonia from Russia, which occurred when World War I was nearing its end. However, Estonia's independence came to a "de facto" end during World War II when the country was illegally occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, then by Nazi Germany in 1941, before it was returned to Soviet rule in 1944 when it became the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. As a result, a government in exile was established.
As political upheavals took place throughout the Soviet Union in the 1980s, during the events of the Baltic Way, Estonia declared sovereignty on its territory in 1988, which restored its "de facto" independence on 8 May 1990 and declared Soviet rule illegal. Following the aborted coup in Moscow, the country's full "de facto" independence was restored after the Soviet troops failed to seize the Tallinn TV Tower on 20 August 1991. The Soviet State Council recognized the Estonian independence on 6 September 1991. Since 2004, Estonia has been a member of NATO and the European Union.
Events.
The centenary celebrations of the Republic of Estonia took place over three years, beginning in April 2017 to mark a century since Estonia's administrative borders took their current form, peaking while events on various important dates took place throughout 2018 and 2019, and coming to a grand close on 2 February 2020 when the 100th anniversary of the Tartu Peace Treaty was honoured.
Centennial parade.
A military parade on Freedom Square in Tallinn was held on the occasion of the 100th anniversary. 1,100 troops and more than 100 pieces of military equipment took part in the parade. The parade was led by Gen. Riho Terras, while President Kersti Kaljulaid was present to greet the different units.
All service branches of the Estonian Defence Forces took part in the parade as well as soldiers from countries from NATO and other military partners of Estonia. The foreign countries that were represented were Finland, France, Georgia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and the United States.

Ruia Morrison

Dame Ruia Mereana Morrison (born 8 May 1936) is a retired New Zealand tennis player. She is Māori from the Te Arawa and Ngāti Tūwharetoa iwi (tribes). Morrison was the first New Zealand woman and the first Māori person to play at Wimbledon and reached the quarter-finals in 1957. She also won 13 national New Zealand tennis titles.
Early life.
Morrison was born in 1936 at Tikitere, a small farming community between Lake Rotoiti and Rotorua in New Zealand's North Island. She was the third of nine children born to Hingawaka (Waki) Morrison and Tanira Kingi.
In 1944, the family moved from Tikitere to live in Te Koutu, Rotorua. Shortly afterwards, Hingawaka Morrison, a rugby and tennis player, built two tennis courts in the community. Morrison, aged 8 years old, wanted to play on the courts but as she was so young her father made her a wooden bat and coached her while she practised on the walls of their house instead. 
Morrison attended Rotokawa and Rotorua Primary Schools, Rotorua High School, and Te Puke High School. In 1953 Aucklander Mrs Mowbray saw her playing tennis in Rotorua and invited her to stay with her in Auckland; Morrison moved to the city and boarded with Mowbray while having her first formal tennis lessons, at the Eden-Epsom Tennis Club. Hoani Waititi, a teacher at St. Stephen's School, saw Morrison playing and approached St. Stephen's sister school, Queen Victoria School for Maori Girls, and made arrangements for her to enrol as a boarder and receive tennis coaching. After finishing high school, Morrison attended Auckland Teachers' College, where she continued to play tennis and also began a long tennis partnership with Heather Robson.
Adult life.
Morrison won the national singles title in 1956 and it became clear that for her to make progress in tennis she would need to compete overseas. Waititi formed a fundraising campaign to help Morrison travel to England to compete at Wimbledon. The campaign was successful, raising more than enough for the trip, and Morrison and Robson left New Zealand in 1957 for England. 
At Wimbledon, Morrison reached the fourth round, beating Billy Woodgate, J.L. Debford and Sheila Armstrong and then losing to American player Betty Pratt, ranked fourth in the world. Pratt invited Morrison, along with the Wimbledon champions Althea Gibson and Maria Bueno, to the Caribbean the following year for international tennis tournaments at Montego Bay, Jamaica, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
In 1958, Morrison reached the third round of Wimbledon. In 1959, she competed at the British Hard Court championships, losing to Christine Truman in the quarterfinals. She won the Guildford Championships by beating South Africa’s Joan Cross, and the mixed doubles with Mexican Gustavo Palafox as her partner. The same year, Morrison and Pat Nettleton reached the third round of the ladies' doubles at Wimbledon and Morrison made the fourth round of the mixed doubles with Brian Woolf from New Zealand. In the Wimbledon singles, Morrison reached the fourth round, losing to the eventual champion Maria Bueno.
In later years, Morrison won the New Zealand national singles title an additional five times and the national doubles title several times as well. In 1961, Morrison donated the excess money from the 1956 fundraising campaign to the Maori Education Board rather than travelling to Wimbledon again. Despite not competing internationally that year, she still won the national singles and doubles titles in 1962.
In 1959 and 1960, Morrison entered the W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills tournament in Auckland, winning the women's title in both years; in 1960 she won the doubles and mixed doubles. In 1965, Morrison and Elizabeth Terry were selected to travel to Melbourne to compete in the Federation Cup. They beat Argentina but lost to Australia.
When Morrison retired from international tennis she donated her remaining winnings to the charitabe foundation which Waititi had founded to support Māori achievers. 
Recognition.
In the 1960 New Year Honours, Morrison was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services in the field of sport, especially tennis. In 2001, Morrison was awarded life membership of the Aotearoa Māori Tennis Association, and in 2003, she was inducted into the Māori Sports Hall of Fame. In 2014, she was made a Tennis New Zealand life member.
In the 2021 Queen's Birthday Honours, Morrison was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to tennis.
Legacy.
In 2011, Aotearoa Maori Tennis President Dick Garratt began researching Morrison's life in preparation for the publication of the biography "Tikitere to Wimbledon &amp; the World – Ruia Morrison".

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Men's pole vault

The men's pole vault at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 4 March 2018.
Summary.
Only 15 competitors meant only a final was held. Several notable names were eliminated early on; 2015 World Champion Shawnacy Barber; 2016 Olympic champion Thiago Braz da Silva; world junior record holder Armand Duplantis; 2014 World Indoor Champion Konstantinos Filippidis; 2011 World Champion Paweł Wojciechowski; and 2013 World Champion Raphael Holzdeppe. Young newcomers Kurtis Marschall and Emmanouil Karalis cleared personal bests of 5.80m to be among the last contenders. The medalists were decided by a first attempt clearance at 5.85m, by Piotr Lisek, Sam Kendricks and Renaud Lavillenie. At that point, Lavillenie was still clean placing him in first place, Kendricks had one miss for second and Lisek had two misses for third. Six other vaulters had attempts left, many strategically passing to 5.90m after the clearances, but none were able to clear another height. In fact, only Lavillenie was able to get over on his second attempt, confirming his win. Kendricks took one attempt for the win at 5.95m but in the end the podium in 2018 was exactly the same as in 2016.
Results.
The final was started at 15:00.

Professor Dowell's Testament

Professor Dowell's Testament () is a 1984 Soviet science fiction film directed by Leonid Menaker, loosely based on the 1925 novel "Professor Dowell's Head" by Alexander Belyaev.
Plot.
Professor Dowell creates a solution to reanimate body parts and later dies of an extensive myocardial infarction. In his will, the professor asks to revive him with the solution. Assistant Professor Dr. Korn connects the professor's head to the solution, and leaves the body in the car, ignites the car and throws it off the road outside the city.
Arthur, son of the professor, comes to the funeral of his father. In a charred car, Arthur discovers an object belonging to Dr. Korn, and gives it to the district police officer as evidence. The professor's head informs Dr. Korn of the code from the bank account of the professor, and Korn is able to pay off his debts.
The police tries to detain drug traffickers in a restaurant; as a result of the shootout, two women are killed. The pathologist writes out the death certificates of two women and passes the bodies to Dr. Korn. Korn connects the head from one body to the body from the other, the woman named Eva and revives with the help of the professor's solution. The head of Eva belonged to a singer who came for a tour, and the body to Arthur's girlfriend. Korn wants to learn how to create the life-giving solution; The professor's head is against this and twice gives Korn the wrong formula.
The son of the professor sees Eva, suspects Dr. Korn in the murder of the professor and gives the district photos of Eva. The police conducts an investigative experiment - a car similar to the professor's car, was dropped from the road with a doll at the wheel. Korn is charged with killing the professor. Korn has to show the head of the professor to the district chief, and the charges of murder are dropped.
At a conference of physicians, Dr. Korn demonstrates Eva, and the professor's head appears with the help of video conferencing. The head of the professor does not give Korn the formula of the solution and dies as the supply of the solution made by the professor during his lifetime ends; the same fate awaits Eva. The secret of the life-giving solution remains unsolved.

Maggie Hathaway

Maggie Mae Hathaway (July 1, 1911 – September 24, 2001) was an American activist, blues singer, actress, sports writer and golfer. She began her career as an actress before venturing into recording in Los Angeles where she released a few singles. Hathaway became known in the 1950s for her activism and golfing. She co-founded the NAACP Image Awards in 1967.
Life and career.
A native of Campti, Louisiana, Hathaway traveled to Los Angeles in 1931 in hopes of playing piano in one of the clubs on Central Avenue, also known as "Black Broadway". Instead, she began her career in the area working as an extra in Hollywood films, usually as an "Egyptian" or an "exotic." After auditioning for "Cabin in the Sky", Hathaway was hired as a body double for Lena Horne throughout much of the film; she later worked as Horne's stand-in in "Stormy Weather". However, her Hollywood career ended when she refused to play an extra in a biopic about Woodrow Wilson which required her to wear a bandanna and sit on a bale of cotton. She then returned to singing in cabaret in Los Angeles clubs, recording several songs including “Bayou Baby Blues,” “School Girl Blues,” “A Falling Star” and “When Gabriel Blows His Horn” with The Robins and “Here Goes a Fool” as a solo artist.
During the civil rights movement, Hathaway would become a major activist in the Los Angeles-Hollywood region. After she took up golf as a pastime after winning a bet against Joe Louis in 1955, she began agitating against local golf courses which restricted black patrons from usage. By 1958, she began writing a golf column in the "California Eagle" about black professional players. She also wrote a golf column in the "Los Angeles Sentinel".
In 1960, Hathaway organized the Minority Association for Golfers (MAG) to support young black golfers by advocating for golf-related employment. In 1963, Hathaway led a picket during the PGA at the Long Beach municipal golf course to protest a lock of golf jobs for black professional golfers. She also campaigned for an increase black player participation in PGA tournaments.
Her agitation spread to broader issues. Hathaway became the founding president of the newly-chartered Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch of the NAACP in 1962. In 1967, she joined with Sammy Davis, Jr. and Willis Edwards in holding the first NAACP Image Awards.
In 1975, Hathaway petitioned for Lee Elder to be invited to play in the Masters Tournament. During the following decades, she continued to write for the "Los Angeles Sentinel". She organized opportunities for young minorities to play and received financial help from PGA players, including Jack Nicklaus.
Hathaway died on September 24, 2001.
Personal life.
She was married to at least four husbands, including King Coleman (from 1979 to 1984). Her daughter Ondra Louise Fleming was born in 1936.
Legacy.
In 1994, Hathaway was inducted into the National Black Golf hall of Fame.
The Jack Thompson Golf Course in Los Angeles was renamed the Maggie Hathaway Golf Course in 1997.

JPEG XT

JPEG XT (ISO/IEC 18477) is an image compression standard which specifies backward-compatible extensions of the base JPEG standard (ISO/IEC 10918-1 and ITU Rec. T.81).
JPEG XT extends JPEG with support for higher integer bit depths, high dynamic range imaging and floating-point coding, lossless coding, alpha channel coding, and an extensible file format based on JFIF. It also includes reference software implementation and conformance testing specification.
JPEG XT extensions are backward compatible with base JPEG/JFIF file format - existing software is forward compatible and can read the JPEG XT binary stream, though it would only decode the base 8-bit lossy image.
The JPEG XT standard.
JPEG standards are formally named as "Information technology – Scalable compression and coding of continuous-tone still images". ISO/IEC 18477 consists of the following parts:
Overview.
The core Part 1 of the standard defines the JPEG specifications in common use today, such as ISO/IEC 10918-1 (base format), 10918-5 JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF), and 10918-6 (printing applications). It restricts the JPEG coding modes to baseline, sequential, and progressive Huffman, and includes JFIF definitions of Rec. 601 color space transformations with YCbCr chroma subsampling. The first specification was authored by Thomas Richter from Germany, Tim Bruylants and Peter Schelkens from Belgium, and Swiss-Iranian engineer Touradj Ebrahimi.
Part 3 Box file format defines an extensible format which is backward-compatible with JFIF. Extensions are based on 'boxes' - 64 KB chunks tagged by application marker 11 ('APP11'), containing enhancement data layers and additional binary metadata describing how to combine them with the base 8-bit layer to form full-precision image. Part 3 builds on the ISO base media file format used by JPEG 2000; similar arrangement was employed in the earlier JPEG-HDR format from Dolby Labs, which is standardized in JPEG XT Part 2.
Part 7 includes floating-point HDR coding tools which produce an enhancement image layer from full-precision image and gamma-corrected tone-mapped 8-bit base image layer. These tools are intended for high dynamic range imaging with multiple photo exposures and computer-generated images which exceed linear 16-bit integer precision.
It defines three main algorithms for reconstructing the HDR image: Profile A uses a common logarithmic scale factor for inverse tone-mapping of the base layer; Profile B uses a divisor image extension layer scaled by the common exposure value; Profile C is similar to A but uses per-component scaling factors and logarithmic space with piece-wise linear functions, which allows lossless encoding. Profile A is based on the Radiance RGBE image format and Profile B is based on the XDepth format from Trellis Management.
Profile D uses a simple algorithm which does not generate an enhancement image – the enhancement layer is used to store extended precision of discrete cosine transform (DCT) transfer coefficients, and non-gamma transfer function is applied to increase dynamic range to 12 bits. Backward compatibility is limited because legacy decoders do not understand new EOTF curves and produce undersaturated colors. Profile D is not implemented in reference software.
JPEG XT also allows mixing of various elements from different profiles in the code stream, allowing extended DCT precision and lossless encoding in all profiles (the 'Full Profile').
Part 6, Integer coding of Intermediate Dynamic Range (IDR) images, is an extension for coding 9 to 16-bit integer samples typical for RAW sensor data; its coding tools are identical to Part 7 Profile C.
Part 2 defines a HDR imaging implementation based on JPEG-HDR format from Dolby. It uses RGBE image format defined by Part 7 Profile A, supporting both integer and floating point samples; file format is based on Part 3 but uses proprietary text-based metadata syntax.
Part 8 Lossless coding is an extension of integer and floating point coding based on Part 7 Profile C, allowing for scalable lossy to lossless compression. For 10 and 12-bit precision, lossless integer-to-integer DCT is used, which replaces each rotation space with three shearings (similar to wavelet transform in JPEG2000). For 16 bit precision, a lossy fixed-point DCT approximation is specified by the standard and is required for decoders to implement. This makes it possible for the encoder to predict coding errors and store them in the enhancement layer, allowing lossless reconstruction. The error residuals in the enhancement layer can be either uncompressed, or compressed with lossless integer-to-integer DCT. Compression and image quality performance of Part 8 is comparable to PNG.
Part 9 Alpha channel extension allows lossy and lossless coding of transparent images and arbitrarily shaped images. It uses an opacity (transparency) layer, encoded with integer or floating point precision, and metadata to specify if content was pre-multiplied with alpha, or pre-multiplied and blended with background color.
In the future, privacy protection and security extensions would allow encoding of private image regions (or entire images) with reduced resolution, with digitally encrypted enhancement layers to restore full-resolution image only to those having the private decryption key. Only the public regions will be visible to those not having the key.
JPEG-HDR.
JPEG XT Part 2 HDR coding is based on Dolby JPEG-HDR format, created in 2005 by Greg Ward from BrightSide Technologies and Maryann Simmons from Walt Disney Feature Animation as a way to store high dynamic range images inside a standard JPEG file. BrightSide Technologies was acquired by Dolby Laboratories in 2007.
The image encoding is based on two-layer RGBE image format used by Radiance renderer, both of which were also created by Ward. Reduction in filesize is achieved by first converting the image into a tone mapped version, then storing a reconstructive multiplier image in APP11 markers in the same JPEG/JFIF file. Ordinary viewing software will ignore the multiplier image allowing anyone to see the tone mapped version of the image presented in a standard dynamic range and color gamut.
JPEG-HDR file format is similar to JPEG XT Part 3 Box file format but uses text-based metadata.
Programs that support JPEG-HDR include Photosphere by Greg Ward and pfstools.
Reference software.
ISO/IEC Joint Photography Experts Group maintains a reference software implementation for base JPEG (ISO/IEC 10918-1 and 18477-1) and JPEG XT extensions (ISO/IEC 18477 Parts 2 and 6-9), as well as JPEG-LS (ISO/IEC 14495). A reduced version without JPEG-LS, arithmetic coding, and a mozjpeg-like hierarchical progressive coder is available under the ISO license. As a contestant for the ICIP Grand Challenge, the author also includes some existing JPEG optimization techniques known as "JPEG on steroids" in the library.
A software JPEG-HDR encoder is provided by Dolby Labs; JPEG XT Part 7 Profile B software is provided by XDepth/Trellis Management; an implementation of all remaining parts was provided by the University of Stuttgart.
Patent Pool.
In April 2019, Luxembourg-based Sisvel announced the formation of a patent pool for JPEG-XT, although there is no list of claimed patents as of July 2021. Members of the pools included Dolby International AB and Trellis Europe S.r.l.
Sisvel's standard prices are .12 Euros for camera based devices, and .06 Euros for camera enabled devices.

Ymyyakhtakh culture

The Ymyyakhtakh culture () was a Late Neolithic culture of Siberia, with a very large archaeological horizon, dating to c. 2200–1300 BC. Its origins seem to be in the Lena river basin of Yakutia, and also along the Yenisei river. From there it spread both to the east and to the west. Individual sites were also found in Taymyr.
It is named after Ymyyakhtakh, a settlement in the Sakha Republic, Russia.
Description.
A. Golovnev discusses Ymyyakhtakh culture in the context of a “circumpolar syndrome”,
A distinctive feature of the culture is the round-bottomed ceramics with waffle and ridge prints on the outer surface. Stone and bone arrowheads, spears and harpoons are richly represented. Armour plates were also used in warfare.
Finds of bronze ware are frequent in the burial grounds. 
The culture was formed by the tribes migrating from the shores of Lake Baikal to the south, merging with the local substrate of the Bel'kachi culture.
The carriers of culture are identified either with the Yukagirs ethnic group, or perhaps with the Chukchi and Koryaks. The Ymyyakhtakh culture continued at least until the first centuries of our era. It was later replaced by the Ust-Mil culture.
Migrations.
After 1,700 BC, the Ymyyakhtakh culture is believed to have spread to the east as far as the Chukotka peninsula, where it was in cultural contact with the Eskimo-Aleut language speakers, and the Paleo-Eskimos.
A ceramic complex comparable to the Ymyyakhtakh culture (typified by pottery with an admixture of wool) is also found in northern Fennoscandia towards the end of the second millennium BC.

The Story of Hair

 
The Story of Hair () is a short story by Lu Xun, the founder of modern Chinese literature. Originally published in October 1920 in the "Lamp of Learning" supplement to the "New Journal of Current Affairs" (時事新報。學燈), it was later included in his first collection of short stories, "A Call to Arms" (吶喊). It is based on Lu Xun's own experience of cutting off his queue and reflects his negative opinion of the Chinese national character.
Background.
 In 1644, after the conquest of China by the Manchurian Qing dynasty, Han Chinese males were forced as a symbol of subservience to adopt the queue, a Manchurian hairstyle consisting of shaving the forehead and wearing the rest of one's hair in a long plait. In 1903, while a student in Japan, Lu Xun cut off his queue, adopted the Japanese Western-style student uniform and grew a moustache. When he returned to Shaoxing in August, his family were scandalised. Lu Xun bought a false queue and wore traditional clothing in the streets, but people noticed the queue was not real and he was jeered at. Lu Xun then did not use the queue and wore Western clothing, attracting even more attention and being called a "fake foreign devil". For the rest of his stay, Lu Xun remained at home. Later, Lu Xun became a school teacher, and attracted derision from the students when he did not urge them to abandon the queue. In his later story "A Storm in a Teacup", a boatman arrives in a Republican village and finds his queue chopped off by revolutionaries, which causes him anxiety when he hears of the abortive Manchu Restoration.
Synopsis.
The narrator, who lives in Beijing, notices that October 10 - Double Ten Day (the National Day of the Republic of China, commemorating the fall of the Qing dynasty)- is not marked on his calendar. (The story was commissioned for a special October 10 issue of the "Lamp of Learning".) Mr N (先生Ｎ), an older acquaintance based on Lu Xun's superior Xia Huiqing at the Ministry of Education, angrily dismisses the importance of the day, which he says is only remembered because the police remind people to put up the flag. Changing tone, he reminisces sadly about his friends who died during the anti-Qing struggle. N then describes his own experience of cutting of his queue, which mirrors that of Lu Xun. N reflects on the subservient position of China, mentioning that he once read an interview with a Japanese traveller who said that he had no need to speak Chinese or Malay when in those countries because he could make himself understood by beating the natives with his cane. He concludes the story by posing a question to idealists like the narrator, quoting the Russian writer Mikhail Artzybashev (who was popular in China at the time): "You promise a golden age to these people's sons and grandsons, but what do you have to offer them here and now?"

Geri Ashur

Geri Ashur (1947-1984) was an American film editor, screenwriter, foreign language dubbing specialist, and filmmaker.
Early life and education.
Geraldine Ashur was born and raised in Jersey City, New Jersey. She attended Jersey Academy for four years in the early 1960s. A progressive private High School, many of the faculty members had been blacklisted during the earlier 1950s red-baiting era for suspected Communist leanings or membership in the party, and had been given employment by the progenitor of the school, Robert Lustgarten, a wealthy stockbroker with left-liberal leanings. Numerous faculty members, from historians and literary scholars to actively practicing and published poets, held an internationalist and cosmopolitan worldview they shared with the students, that included French Symbolist, 20th-century German and Russian poetry, Whitman and Hart Crane, European Classical music, and in particular foreign films - which included the masterpieces of the Italian neo-realists, Satyajit Ray, Fellini, Antonioni, Bergman, Andrzej Wajda and Kurasawa among others, influencing Ashur and other of the students as well including her contemporary Maury Yeston. Ashur also studied painting at New York's Art Students League during that time.
She graduated from Barnard College in 1968.
Career.
Ashur began making films with the New York Newsreel, a political collective. 
From 1974 to 1982 Ashur specialized as a dubbing editor, working on such films as Ingmar Bergman's "Autumn Sonata," Bernardo Bertolucci's "1900," Francois Truffaut's "The Last Metro" and Lina Wertmüller's "Seven Beauties."
Ashur directed the documentary "Janie’s Janie" (1971)"," which uses a more personal approach, following one woman’s journey to self-determination, or as Janie says, “First I was my father’s Janie, then I was my Charlie’s Janie, now I’m Janie’s Janie.”
Ashur also directed "Me and Stella" (1975), a portrait of the American blues and folk musician, Elizabeth Cotten.
She lived in Manhattan and died of lung cancer in 1984 at the age of 37, survived by her husband, Richard Brick, and her son, Noah.

Battle of Kozelsk

The Battle of Kozelsk was the first victory of False Dmitry II against the government of Tsar Vasili IV Shiuski.
Prelude.
As the rebellion of Ivan Bolotnikov was coming to an end in central Russia, a new impostor, False Dmitry II, appeared on the Polish border, collecting Cossacks and Polish-Lithuanian mercenaries under his banner. By July 1607 he was recognized by the people of Starodub, Chernigov, Putivl, and Novgorod-Seversky. 
Battle.
In September 1607, False Dmitry II left Starodub with some 3.000 men in order to relieve Bolotnikov, besieged in Tula. At Kozelsk, on October 8, 1607, the rebels won their first victory against the government troops of Vasili IV Shuiski.
Aftermath.
Despite the victory at Kozelsk, the capture of Tula on October 10 by Tsar Vasili made further efforts to relieve Bolotnikov meaningless. So the rebels besieged Bryansk in November 1607, where False Dmitry II was joined by 4.000 former Bolotnikov Cossacks, 3.000 Don Cossacks, and some 2.500 Polish mercenaries. Nevertheless, the rebels were defeated at Bryansk on December 25, 1607 by the government relief army.

Emily Mae Smith

Emily Mae Smith (born 1979) is a visual artist from Austin, Texas.
Biography.
Emily Mae Smith (born 1979) is a visual artist from Austin, Texas who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Smith typically creates narrative oil paintings. In Patricia Hickson’s text about Emily Mae Smith’s exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum, she writes, “With a nod to distinct painting movements in the history of art, such as Symbolism, Surrealism, and Pop art, Emily Mae Smith creates lively compositions that offer sly social and political commentary.”
Education.
Smith attended the University of Texas from 1997-2002, receiving a B.F.A. in Studio Art. Upon graduating in 2002, she was presented with the Roy Crane Award by the University of Texas. In 2005, Smith received the Edward Mazzella Jr. Scholarship from Columbia University. And in 2006, she received her M.F.A. in Visual Art from Columbia University. 
Selected Works.
Symbolism of the broom.
An anthropomorphized broom is a reoccurring symbol in Smith’s works. Patricia Hickson writes, “Leading with humor, she presents a vocabulary of signs and symbols that start with her avatar, inspired by the bewitched broomstick figure from The Sorcerer’s Apprentice sequence in Disney’s animated film Fantasia (1940). This unlikely (…) choice is an astute one as the broom simultaneously alludes to a painter’s brush, a domestic tool associated with women’s work, and the phallus. Smith’s flexible character has continued to evolve across her body of work. By adopting a wide variety of guises, the broom and a stock pile of other coded symbols speak to timely, relevant subjects, including gender, sexuality, capitalism, and violence.” 
Exhibitions.
Smith has had solo exhibitions at multiple institutions around the world, such as MATRIX 181, curated by Patricia Hickson at the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut, 2019; Emily Mae Smith, curated by Eric Troncy at Le Consortium, Dijon, France, 2018; and The Little Apocrypha, with Adam Henry &amp; Emily Mae Smith at SALTS art center, Birsfelden, Switzerland, 2017. She has also been featured in prominent art galleries including Perrotin, Tokyo (upcoming in September 2019); Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin, Germany; Simone Subal Gallery, New York; and Rodolphe Janssen, Brussels, Belgium. She has participated in group shows in galleries including Perrotin, Peter Freeman, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, Kohn Gallery, König, and Marlborough Fine Art.

Cynthia Charlotte Moon

Cynthia Charlotte "Lottie" Moon (1828–1895) was born in Danville, Virginia on August 10, 1828. She and her sister, Virginia "Ginnie" Moon are best known for their role as Confederate spies during the American Civil War. When the girls were young, their father sold their slaves and moved the family north to Oxford, Ohio where they lived in the house that is known as the "Lottie Moon House." As spies for the Confederacy, Lottie and Ginnie smuggled information and medicine from North to South.
Early life.
Moon performed in amateur plays, often using her skills as a ventriloquist. As a young woman, she was engaged to a young officer (and later Union general), Ambrose E. Burnside, whom she left at the altar. When the minister asked if she took Burnside as her husband, it is claimed that she answered "No siree, Bob!" Later, she was engaged to sixteen Confederate soldiers at once in an effort to allow them to at least die happily.
Espionage career.
Before the American Civil War, Moon married Judge James Clark. Her younger sister lived with them briefly after being expelled from her school for her pro-confederacy views. The Clarks' home was a stopping point for Confederate couriers and Moon began her espionage career when a letter needed to be delivered but no courier was available. Throughout the war, both sisters used various disguises. Various anecdotal incidents include spying on President Abraham Lincoln, passing herself off as a traveling British subject with forged papers, pretending to be in horrible pain due to a dislocated jaw, and hiding medicine and pain relievers in her quilted hoop skirts. Once, the sisters and their mother were caught by Moon's jilted ex-fiancé, General Burnside. He kept them under house arrest, but eventually released them.
Post-War.
After the war, Moon moved to New York with her husband, Jim Clark. She began a second career as a journalist, eventually covering the Franco-Prussian War from various capitals in Europe. She died in Philadelphia on November 20, 1895 and was survived by her sister Ginnie and her son, Franklin Pinckney Clark.

Gail Brion

Gail Montgomery Brion is an inventor and a professor of civil engineering and the Director of the Environmental Research and Training Laboratories (ERTL) at the University of Kentucky. An expert on waterborn illness, she holds a co-appointment in the College of Public Health. She works to introduce and maintain high quality water systems in rural regions.
Career.
Brion first followed her interests to Duncan, Lagnese, and Associates Incorporated, an industrial waste company, where she acted as the Sewer Studies Field Team Supervisor. From 1979 to 1980, Brion worked as the Sewage Treatment Plant Operator for the Brush Run Municipal in Mckeesport, PA where she analyzed water and waste water. The following year, she moved to another Municipal Sewage Treatment Plant in Rock Springs, Wyoming where she took over as the Chief Lab Analyst. From 1981 to 1982 Brion worked as a Product Specialist for the Hach Company, assisting in chemical analysis and customer troubleshooting. Starting in March 1982, she began as the Plant Chemist for the Fort St. Vrain Generating Station, analyzing the cooling, waste, and natural water systems. 1984 marked the start of her 6 year employment for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, working under 3 different divisions over that time span. While in the Water Quality Division Brion worked as a Co-op Student Engineer. In the Air and Toxics Division she held the title of NESHAPS Asbestos Coordinator and finally in the Office of Air Quality Rulings and Standards as an Environmental Engineer. 
Brion worked for the Environmental Protection Agency before she began teaching engineering at the University of Kentucky in 1995.
She now connects research and work between the University of Kentucky's Environmental Engineering program and the College of Public Health to accomplish mutual goals that benefit public health through engineering.
She is concerned that the lack of ongoing support for water infrastructure in marginalized areas is resulting in ongoing deterioration that will continue until "something large and catastrophic happens".
Education.
In 1978, Brion received her bachelor of science degree in Environmental Engineering from the University of California. Continuing her educational journey, Brion then completed both her masters of science and PhD in Civil Engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1985 and 1995 respectively.
Advocacy.
Brion's interest in waterborn illness began in childhood, inspired by personal experiences with water contamination. 
Some of her friends became ill after wading in a city park creek. After investigating, she found an unregulated straight pipe dumping untreated hospital wastes into the water. She also saw a migrant family, whose children were too sick to work at a berry field, drinking untreated irrigation water because no other water sources were available. She commented, "a desire to make a difference was kindled."

River Road Wine Trail

The River Road Wine Trail is a Salinas Valley roadway trail for wine-tasting following the River Road along the western banks of the Salinas River (California). It is not to be confused with the Great River Road Wine Trail that follows along the banks of the Mississippi River. It is notably referenced in numerous books and magazines.
History.
The River Road (Monterey County, California G-17) follows along the banks of the Salinas River and predates the wineries by many decades. It runs along the length of the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA. The earliest grape plantings, however, were in the 1790s, with the arrival of the Spanish missions in California. The arrival of commercial wineries (and wine-tasting), began in the early 1970s, with initial plantings by Smith at Paraiso, by McFarland at Sleepy Hollow, by Johnson at La Estancia, and by Hahn at Smith &amp; Hook. The hot days of the Salinas Valley make for good Syrahs, and the cool foggy nights are ideal for Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and other cool-climate varieties.
Currently there are at least 24 wineries in the Salinas Valley with at least 13 tasting rooms lining River Road, going from Salinas, California south to Greenfield, California. They are perched on the Santa Lucia Highlands, and present great views of the rich farmlands below.
The Salinas River Wine Trail was named by Wine Enthusiast Magazine in the top ten wine travel destinations in the world, with only two other locations (New York and Oregon) from North America.
Distance to wine-tasting facilities.
The Wine-Tasting Facilities are usually encountered driving south from Highway 68 where it crosses the Salinas River. Using that as a starting point, the Wine-Tasting distances are tabulated below:
1. Odonata Wines South • 645 River Road, Salinas – 7 mi.
2. Pessagno Winery • 1645 River Rd, Salinas – 16 mi.
3. Manzoni Vineyards • 30981 River Road, Soledad – 17 mi.
4. Puma Road Winery • 32720 River Road, Soledad – 23 mi.
5. Wrath Wines • 35801 Foothill Road, Soledad – 24 mi.
6. Hahn Family • 37700 Foothill Road, Soledad – 26 mi.
7. Smith Family Wines • 38060 Paraiso Springs Road, Soledad – 31 mi.
8. Ventana Vineyards • 38740 Los Coches Road, Soledad – 35 mi.
Nearby wine trail.
At the end of the River Road Wine Trail is the start of another wine trail. At Greenfield, if one takes the Arroyo Seco Road westward, it branches into the Carmel Valley Road from which one can then take the Carmel Valley Wine Trail northwards, passing Carmel Valley Village, California and ending up in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.

Beatrice Riese

Beatrice Riese (1917, The Hague–2004, New York, NY) was an artist and art collector.
Personal life.
Riese was born in The Netherlands and lived with her family in Germany. She studied art in Paris form 1936 to 1940, earning a Baccalaureate. There, she developed a lifelong appreciation for African art, which she first saw at the Musée de l'Homme after it opened in 1937. In 1940, in advance of the German invasion, she and her parents fled to Africa. They went to Casablanca and then boarded a freighter to the African Gold Coast (now the Republic of Ghana). They soon resettled in Richmond, Virginia.
After relocating to the United States in 1940, Riese studied with Clyfford Still at Virginia Commonwealth University (from 1943-1945) and with Will Barnet in New York (from 1955-1965). She moved to New York in 1949. She joined American Abstract Artists, where she served as president (from 1990) for more than a decade. She was a member of A.I.R. Gallery, the first all female artists cooperative gallery in the United States.
Works.
Riese had many solo exhibitions and her artwork is in the collections of more than forty museums, including the Brooklyn Museum, Krannert Art Museum, Pratt Institute, Museum of Modern Art, National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, Snite Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and others.
For her artworks that employ a grid structure, Riece may have taken inspiration from the work of Indian Space painters in the 1940s and early 1950s, including Will Barnet. Stephen Westfall argues that although those works are not structured using a grid, they share the same "interlocking spatial reversals and movements and fluid hard-edged style."
Art collecting.
Riece collected African and Native American artwork. She acquired her first piece of African art in 1950 from Julius Carlebach, one of the earliest dealers of African art in New York. Her African art collection now belongs to the Brooklyn Museum. The museum organized an exhibition of thirty of her West and Central African masks and figural sculptures in 2000. She also gave artwork from her collection to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Snite Museum of Art at Notre Dame University.

George Dickinson Hadley

George Dickinson Hadley FRCP (30 June 1908 – 14 August 1984) was an English gastroenterologist. He served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the Second World War and was taken prisoner during the Dunkirk evacuation. He made several failed escape attempts during his incarceration. In 1963 he introduced the gastrocamera to Britain, thus enabling the development of endoscopy in that country.
Early life and family.
George Dickinson Hadley, known as "Dicken" at home, was born on 30 June 1908, the son of Laurence Hadley, editor of the "Birmingham Post". He was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, and then at Clare College, University of Cambridge, from where he earned a first class honours degree in natural sciences.
He married Jean Stewart in 1947, who was a professional viola player, and they had three daughters who all played instruments. The composer Ralph Vaughan Williams later became a patient and confidant. Hadley inherited a library of fishing books from his father which he rebound and he was a fly-fisher himself as well as having an interest in oriental rugs. In later life he became so proficient at book-binding that dealers sent their books to him to work on.
Medical career.
Hadley was house physician to Charles Lakin and house surgeon to Gordon Gordon-Taylor. 
Between 1936 and 1938 he became an Elmore research student at Cambridge and established his lifelong interest in peptic ulcers. Subsequently, he became registrar to Donald Hunter at the London Hospital.
At the start of the Second World War in 1939, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was captured during the Dunkirk evacuation and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner despite several escape attempts. Being of a professional standard in cello and with instruments provided by the Red Cross, he helped establish an orchestra in his prisoner of war camp. Having plenty of time on his hands, he was also closely involved in the prisoners' observations of nesting birds, the studies of which found their way into the Collins New Naturalist book series after the war. His war-time experience greatly affected him, however, and he turned from a pre-war "typical medical student – outgoing with a love of fast cars" to an "intensely shy and often monosyllabic" man who developed a "reputation for epigrammatic description" from which he partly recovered with the help of his wife.
After the war, Hadley became resident medical officer at the Middlesex Hospital. A year later, he was appointed assistant physician, and was later chosen to be physician at the Canadian Red Cross Hospital, Taplow. He used the Hermon Taylor and Schindler instruments from 1949 and imported the first gastrocamera to Britain from Japan in 1963. He went on to be a pioneer of fibreoptic endoscopy. His 1967 paper with L.M. Blendis and A.J. Cameron in "Gut", titled "Analysis of 400 examinations using the gastrocamera", was described by the editors as confirming "the claim that the use of the gastrocamera is a safe, simple, and easily learnt technique which has been found to be of considerable value in the diagnosis of gastric diseases."
Later life.
Hadley was seriously ill in his last five years and died at his home in London on 14 August 1984. He received an obituary in the "British Medical Journal" and is recorded in Munk's Roll. His funeral was at Putney Vale Crematorium in Roehampton, London.

Kiran Nadar Museum of Art

The Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) is a private modern and contemporary art museum with locations in New Delhi and Noida. Established in 2010, it is India's first private museum dedicated to modern and contemporary art. The core collection of the institution comprises post-independence 20th century painters, but the museum holds exhibits of younger, contemporary artists as well. It is a multi faceted initiative, that helps promote art in public spheres and encourages art appreciation with an active collaboration between artists, schools and the public.
The New Delhi location has about 18,000 sq ft of exhibition space and the Noida location has 13,000 sq ft.
History.
The birth of the museum started from an idea of making art more accessible to the larger public; which was sparked and nestled by avid art collector and philanthropist Kiran Nadar. The inspiration to establish India's first private museum exhibiting Modern and contemporary art came from institutions like Guggenheim, MoMA, and the Whitney, which all started out as private museums. At the heart of their mission desires to be an avenue for building an active and erudite audience on Indian art and culture not only through their innovative exhibitions that introduces the public to contemporary artists both nationally and internationally but also through workshops involving schools and colleges, art appreciation discourses, symposiums and public programs. The museum sponsored by the Shiv Nadar Foundation started out as a gallery created in the premises of HCL Technologies in Noida  which opened its doors to the public in January 2010 with an exhibition titled "Open Doors". The exhibition comprises extraordinary works that Kiran Nadar collected over the last two decade signifying the relevant moment in the 20th century art. After a year it moved into South Court Mall, inaugurated with the exhibition "Time unfolded" where the work of 50 artists were displayed. The decision to create the space in a shopping mall served their larger aim of bringing visibility to modern and contemporary art from India and subcontinent. It could be made manifest by making it easier and more convenient for the average mall goers to visit. These conscious steps made by the museum spearheaded by Roobina Karode who has held the position of Director and Chief Curator since its inception is telling of its role as a public sphere driven by the aspiration of bridging the gap between the art and the public. Her curatorial work which has been monumental and challenging in creating more avenues and ideas wherein the assertion of the museum as a space for ‘dialogue and sustained interaction’ could be made possible.
Collection.
Kiran Nadar's passion of collecting art over the years propelled a desire in her to share her collection to the larger public, with an underlying concern of the lack of institutional spaces in India that allowed for such works of art to be displayed. This personal act of joy has resulted in an ever growing collection that now includes more than 4500 works ranging from the late 19th century till present day. The core collection holds historically important works acquired from various sources include artists ranging from celebrated Indian painters like Raja Ravi Varma and M. F. Husain to contemporary blue-chip artists like Anish Kapoor, and emerging artists. Other artists include A. Ramachandran, Arpita Singh, F. N. Souza, Jamini Roy, Jogen Chowdhury, Krishen Khanna, Manjit Bawa, N. S. Harsha, Ram Kumar, Rameshwar Broota, S. H. Raza, Subodh Gupta, Tyeb Mehta, and V. S. Gaitonde. Two of the most significant paintings acquired by Kiran Nadar that is now a part of the museum's permanent collection is Syed Haider Raza's seminal work "Saurashtra" which fetched a record 16.42 crore ($3,486,965) at the famous Christie’s in London in 2010. The second one was in 2015 where she bid 26.41 crore for the monumental 8 ft x 4 ft oil painting "Birth" (1955)  by F.N Souza , a painting considered one of his best.
Exhibition.
KNMA intent on, in the words of Kiran Nadar ‘demystifying art for the common man’ has situated itself as an exemplary standard for a new genre of museum that breaks away from conventional display practices. As it is located in the midst of a crowded space of a mall, the museum garners more visits from the common public as opposed to other museums that are independently located, frequented only by a section that is keen on viewing art. Keeping this in mind the museum has to provide exciting and new interventions to the existing and older art movements. The 34,000 square feet museum has housed several critically acclaimed exhibitions . The admirable permanent collection of the museum have made large scale retrospective exhibitions possible and loaned out paintings to both national and international museums. They have collaborated with state museums like Bihar museum in 2017 for a retrospective of Himmat Shah's prolific career and with The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2016 for a showcase of Nasreen Mohamedi's large oeuvre. KNMA in a larger attempt to collaborate with private ad government art institutions all across the country have collaborated with the kochi Muziris biennale and Madhavan Nayar foundation for an exhibition titled "Pond near the Field: Five artists from Kerala" (12 December 2016 – 30 April 2017).
The retrospectives are a celebration of the lives of seminal modernist artists by highlighting important moments from their careers. The focus on a singular artist allows the public to recognise their relevance and trace significant trajectories in the history of Indian Art post independence. These exhibitions offer us a glimpse into the creative process of the artists, their personal struggles and aesthetic sensibilities that were constantly evolving. Diaries, sketches in note books, photographs and lesser known works are displayed to draw out these intrinsic details. Furthermore, lectures and symposiums are held to offer a deeper understanding behind the works and lives of these artists.

The museum also provides a platform for upcoming artists to showcase their work and in concomitant creates a broader cognisance of the contemporary art world. These exhibitions are immersive in nature with concepts that provoke and challenge the visitor in the hopes of displacing the usual passive experience of a museum. They are constantly dealing with themes that challenges the role of the museum as a public sphere, wishing to expand its horizons from being a space that caters specifically to a curated class to be a meeting ground of different cultures and communities. Some important exhibitions that deal with such complexities are -
Moreover, in a few exhibitions the public is also introduced to more participative forms of viewing art through unique curatorial engagements with alternative and socially engaged art practices and concepts.
The museum allows artists to stretch the potentiality of mediums by engaging with less explored terrains that are carefully researched much like an ethnographic study ; incorporating transformational senses beyond sight such as touch, sound, smell, energies, disrupting complacent movements by active participation.
Public outreach and participation.
KNMA as a public institution that places the diffusion of knowledge at the helm of their agenda conducts numerous educational activities to materialise the chairperson's philanthropic dream. The museum collaborates with schools, colleges, NGOs, trusts through screening of films, stimulating curatorial programs, curated walk, where artist themselves frequently head these programs. Series which encourages the interaction, and narrows the gap between artist and the public such as ‘Invitation for a coup’ which invites young artists curated by Akansha Rastogi to lead the audience into a discussion or a construction of their art practice. The space provides for stimulating questions around the introduction of certain keywords and doubts regarding their art making.The museum also conducts workshops for children and families to generate spaces where they can explore art together through hands on activities, gallery trails and story telling sessions. The activities are primarily to  encourage the youth to discover and ask more questions around the museum and the works of art. Academic level engagements are also organised through the Lectures/ Symposiums series which invites experts to provide insights and intervention that seek new possibilities for art historical debates and discussions in the globalised world with a focus on south Asian art.
International collaborations.
KNMA's international collaboration has helped underrepresented practices of artists such as Nasreen Mohamedi and Bhupen Khakhar gain international visibility which has evenled to new research and study.
Nasreen Mohamedi's retrospective in collaboration with the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, Spain was held from September 2015 to 11 January 2016 and continued at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, USA from March to June 2016. It was the first comprehensive showing of any Indian artist, it gave the platform to recognise her as an artist who was a distinct figure, breaking away from the dominant figurative - narrative mainstream practice. More than 130 paintings, drawing, photographs and rarely seen diaries, tracing the conceptual complexity and visual subtlety of the artist’s oeuvre were on display.
Bhupen Khakhar's work was also brought together works from around the world in collaboration with the Tate Modern, London , titled "Bhupen Khahar: You can’t please all"  Khakhar renowned for hs unique figurative style, the exhibition allowed the public to discover his extraordinary work of narrative paintings with influences ranging from devotional aesthetics and street culture to reopen painting and pop art. His work revealed his incisive observations of class and sexuality and also a journey of his inspirational story.
The museum's collection of Amar Kanwar's work were loaned to the Documenta14, the world’s largest and most prestigious quinquennial, opened in Athens and Kassel (10 June - 17 September 2017). The Museum also supported the production of his 85 minute film ‘such a morning’ 
The museum was also one of the primary sponsors of Nalini Malini’s first retrospective in Europe at the Centre Pampidou , Paris, France. A continuation of the retrospective of Malani's oeuvre "You can’t keep acid in a paper bag"  in the KNMA in 2014. An exploration of female subjectivity and a profound condemnation of violence.  The exhibition covered 50 years of creativity, from 1969 to present day.

Padelford Riverboats

Padelford Riverboats, established in 1969, is the sole provider of river boat cruises within the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area in the Twin Cities of the U.S. State of Minnesota. Padelford boats cruise on the Mississippi River and celebrate the history of the region.
The Padelford Riverboat Company is based at Harriet Island in downtown St. Paul. The company was founded in 1969 by William Bowell - a World War II decorated veteran - at a time when the Mississippi River was neglected and underused. The activities of Bowell and Padelford helped build relationships between the people and the river, and spurred positive changes on the riverfront.
History.
Founder William Bowell grew up close to the river, helping his father's small business on Harriet Island. He served in World War II, then enrolled at Macalester College after the war. His lifelong dream was to pilot a boat on the Mississippi River. He was a curator for the Minnesota Historical Society and later a businessman, but returned to the river in 1969 to start the Padelford Riverboat business. His lifelong collection of books about the river, along with historic photographs, books, blueprints, original documents, and other reference materials are stored in the Captain William D. Bowell, Jr. River Library, housed in the National Mississippi River Museum &amp; Aquarium in Dubuque, Iowa.
After initially purchasing the paddle steamer "Jonathan Padelford", Bowell continued to expand the boat inventory. He also expanded the original boat itself - cutting it in half and adding a 20-foot section at midship. The eventual fleet included three coast-guard rated boats and 5 vessels total.
In 2006, the three co-owners sold one of their boats, the "Harriet Bishop", to buy a new overnight cruiser to replace the "Viking Explorer", which had been sold in 1998. But before they could get their hands on one, the economy slipped into recession and that extra cash ended up providing the necessary resources for the company to remain in operation.
Operations.
The company was founded by Captain William Bowell, who retired in 2002, passing leadership of the company to his family members Bill Bowell Jr, Beth Myers, Shelley Kosmo, Steve Bowell, and Jim Kosmo; and General Manager Gus Gaspardo.
The Padelford operated out of Harriet Island originally, and continues to this day. For a period from 1988 until 2004, they also operated from Boom Island in Minneapolis. Their Minneapolis operations were within a contract with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and ended when the two parties were unable to come to terms for a new contract.
Starting in 1996, Padelford partnered with the National Park Service, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the St. Paul chapter of the National Audubon Society, Hamline University's Center for Global Environmental Education, and other government agencies and nonprofit organizations to create a temporary floating classroom/field trip series. This field trip series on a Padelford riverboat includes curriculums involving environmental studies, ecology, aquatic life and watershed stewardship as well as cultural studies and regional history.
The Padelford company partnered with the University of Minnesota to bring back their flagship vessel, the Minnesota Centennial Showboat, containing a 210-seat theater. The Showboat Players - theater students of the University - performed melodramas and olios in that venue. Originally operated by the University itself, the refurbished vessel arrived back at Harriet Island on April 17, 2002. The University decided to end the partnership due to declining interest in melodramas. Its final show - also featured during its first season - was "Under the Gaslight" in 2016.
In 2004, the Padelford participated in the 2004 Grand Excursion, celebrating the 150-yr anniversary of the original grand excursion in 1854. As part of that event, the company provided public and private cruises from Diamond Bluff, Wisconsin for one week. The Padelford participated in other steamboat revival events throughout the region.
The company was a founding member of the Passenger Vehicle Association and has been an active member in the association.
Mississippi riverfront resurgence.
In the early part of the century, industrialization and farming activities caused the Mississippi to become very polluted. Not only was the MNRRA region named and identified, but regular recreational activity of all kinds increased starting in that period.
When Bowell launched the Padelford, there were no cruise lines operating in that stretch of the River - the closest was in Iowa. The locks and dams had recently been built and the river was used mainly for industrial shipping. Bowell went against that grain and provided access to the river on a recreational basis, including also a dose of regional history in each excursion. Through to the current day, the company remains involved in a wide variety of activities focused on the River.
Vessels.
The Jonathan Padelford is a nearly-authentic Mark Twain-era sternwheeler riverboat that was built in 1969 at Dubuque Boat and Boiler Co., Dubuque, IA. The boat replicates the paddle wheel mechanism, but operates on diesel fuel instead of the original steam technology. Two years after completion the Padelford was taken to a shipyard in Lemont, IL where it was cut in two and a 20-foot section was added at midship. The lengthening increased capacity and made the overall length 125 feet with a 24-foot beam. Capacity: 313. The name Jonathan Padelford is that of the founder's 10th great-maternal grandfather and territorial pioneer who came to Minnesota in 1856.
In 1988 the 300-passenger sidewheeler Anson Northrup was added. Built in 1988 in Jennings, LA the Northrup started in service with public excursions on Father’s Day, June 19, 1988. Length - 92 feet.
In 1990 a car/truck ferry vessel named the Brandon Paul from Tiptonville, Kentucky was acquired, renamed the Betsey Northrup and converted to a two deck, 300-passenger party barge. The main deck was enclosed while the second deck was left open but was covered for maximum sightseeing. Length - 108 feet.
Viking Explorer - formerly the Arkansas Explorer - Length - 110 feet; built in 1980; Capacity - 34 passengers. Mini cruise ship with 24 staterooms, provided cruises that ranged as far as Florida. Viking Explorer was sold in 1992.
Harriet Bishop - Length - 98 Feet; Built 1987, Utica, Indiana; Capacity - Harbor Cruises: 350, Riverboat Race, Themed Harbor and Parade of Tall Stacks Cruises: 300, Lunch and Dinner Cruises: 264.
Captain Frank M. Whiting - Showboat built in 2002 by John Nichols of Mississippi Marine for the University of Minnesota and Padelford. Owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by Padelford as the replacement of the original Minnesota Centennial Showboat until 2016. Capacity - 499.

Vice President of Chile

Vice president of Chile was a political position in Chile from 1826 to 1833.
In 1826, jointly with the establishment of the title of President of the Republic, the position of Vice President was created, whose function was to replace the President in the cases of illness, absence and others. Agustín Eyzaguirre was elected as the first vice president in the election of 1826. Francisco Antonio Pinto was designated in the position in the election of following year.
The Constitution of 1828, the only Chilean constitution that established the vicepresidency as a permanent position, provided that in case of death or physical or moral impossibility of the president, he would replace him in his post. The required qualities were the same as those required from president. The appointment of Joaquín Vicuña as vice president, after the election of 1829, the first under the rule of the Charter of 1828, was the object of a great controversy and is considered one of the triggers of the Revolution of 1829. The permanent position of vice president was abolished with the 1833 Constitution, Diego Portales being the last to occupy it.
Since then, the title of Vice President is only used for the first in the order of succession to discharge the duties of the president in case of temporary impediment or vacancy. The Vice President, in the performance of his duties, has all the powers that the Constitution confers on the President.

Taiwan Travel Act

The Taiwan Travel Act (, ) is an Act of the United States Congress. Passed on February 28, 2018, it was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 16, 2018. As a follow-up to the Taiwan Relations Act, the bill allows high-level officials of the United States to visit Taiwan and vice versa.
The law is considered a substantial upgrade to Taiwan–United States relations, making them official though still sub-diplomatic. As such, the law was harshly criticized by the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing (which had formally protested the bill through ambassador Cui Tiankai, demanding it not pass) for violating the One-China principle, which holds that Taiwan is an inalienable sovereign part of China.
In July 2019, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen used this act to travel freely to New York City, New York and Denver, Colorado while in transit to countries in the Caribbean that still have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Before the act was passed, Taiwanese presidents usually could only meet local Texas government officials in Houston, Texas, which is where he or she could get on transit flights to the Caribbean and South America. Tsai was the first Taiwanese president to visit UN ambassadors of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in New York since the passage of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. In New York, she also met with a U.S. congressional delegation headed by U.S. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and Ranking Member Michael McCaul (R-TX). In Denver, she met with the governor of Colorado, some U.S. congressmembers and mayors from the local area and visited the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Background.
When the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, it also ceased to officially recognize Taiwan but continued to maintain unofficial relations with the island. In the same year, the U.S. enacted the Taiwan Relations Act.
In 2016, the Taiwan Travel Act was introduced to the U.S. Congress by Representative Steve Chabot and Senator Marco Rubio; part of the House Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, respectively. The bill was considered a follow-up to the Taiwan Relations Act and stated that the U.S. and Taiwan had suffered from insufficient high-level communication since 1979, when the U.S. started to restrict its officials' visits to Taiwan.
Chinese pressure on Congress.
In August 2017, Cui Tiankai, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, sent a letter expressing "grave concern" to leaders of the House and Senate, demanding they block provisions related to Taiwan in the National Defense Authorization Act of that year, which included the Taiwan Travel Act as well as the Taiwan Security Act of 2017. In the letter, Ambassador Cui stated the legislation together with another bill () represent “provocations against China’s sovereignty, national unity and security interests,” and “have crossed the ‘red line’ on the stability of the China-U.S. relationship”. US lawmakers perceived this wording, together with the Chinese threat of “severe consequences” as inappropriate interference and "out of line".
American responses.
One Democratic aide said: “Making these sorts of threats and laying down ‘red lines’ on domestic legislative action is neither helpful or constructive to build the sort of relationship needed between the United States and China.” "The Washington Post" journalist Josh Rogin noted:Other congressional aides said that no other embassy uses threats as a tactic to influence Congress, especially not via an official communication. Most embassies try to build relationships and persuade U.S. policymakers to support what they believe is in their national interest. But not China.Ranking House Foreign Affairs Committee Democrat Eliot Engel (D-NY) said in response:“China carries out this kind of heavy-handed behavior with other countries around the world. It’s interesting to me that they now feel that they can get away with these kind of threats and vague pressure tactics with the U.S. Congress.”It has been suggested that China's heavy-handed tactics and direct threats to United States Congress through official communications backfired, by forcing Congress to make a show of force against perceived Chinese bullying. This effected the unanimous passage of the law.
Congressional delegation to Taiwan in September 2018.
In September 2018, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce led a bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers to Taiwan, where he was awarded the Republic of China (Taiwan)'s Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon from President Tsai Ing-wen for his "outstanding contributions to Taiwan's development". Royce had previously been awarded the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon in 2015.
Upon receiving his accolade from President Tsai on September 1st, Royce said:“I am honored to receive the Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon and view it as a symbol of the special bonds between the U.S. and Taiwan. I want to thank President Tsai for receiving me today, and for her commitment to making the partnership between our two peoples even stronger – a commitment I share. Taiwan is one of our most important friends in the Asia Pacific region, and our partnership is anchored in a shared commitment to democratic values.“As a free and democratic society, Taiwan is an example to its neighbors in the Asia Pacific. Its economy is diverse and growing, which means there is great potential for increased economic ties. The United States will remain steadfast in its commitments to Taiwan’s security. The Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances make it clear that a stable, free, and prosperous Taiwan is in America’s national security interests.”
Legislative history.
On , the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed the bill with no opposition. Committee Chairman Ed Royce explained:Currently, the State Department enforces self-imposed restrictions on official travel between the U.S. and Taiwan. This bill denounces that practice by encouraging more frequent official visits – including at the highest levels – and will serve to further strengthen the critical U.S.-Taiwan partnership. This bill builds off legislation we passed out of the committee last month, which addressed Taiwan’s exclusion from the World Health Assembly.The following day on , a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented:The Chinese side urges the US side to comply with the one-China policy and the principles of the three China-US joint communiques and cautiously handle the Taiwan question, not to engage in any official exchange and contact with Taiwan or send any wrong message to the "Taiwan independence" separatists lest the larger picture of the China-US relations should be disrupted and undermined.In January 2018, the bill was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. Shortly afterwards, it was also passed unanimously by the Senate on February 28. President Donald Trump signed the Act into law on March 16, 2018.
Provisions.
Provisions of the Taiwan Travel Act state that the U.S. should:
Reaction.
Taiwan.
In January 2018, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen expressed her gratitude to the U.S. Congress for "supporting Taiwan’s democracy" through her Twitter account, stating she believed the Taiwan Travel Act would "strengthen and enhance the long-standing partnership between the two sides." Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also showed its support for the bill, saying Taiwan was "committed to fostering an upgraded strategic partnership with the U.S."
People's Republic of China.
The Chinese state-controlled "Xinhua News Agency" indicated that China was "strongly dissatisfied" with the bill and said it violated the one-China policy that asserts Taiwan is a province of China.

D.H. and Leah Curran House

The D.H. and Leah Curran House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.
It is a one-and-a-half-story frame house on a concrete foundation. It was deemedarchitecturally significant as a well-preserved local example of late Craftsman residential design. In South Dakota as well as elsewhere in the United States, residential architecture during the early twentieth century was heavily influenced by the Craftsman building form, an indigenous American style popularized through numerous pattern books and popular publications. In many areas of the country, simple variants of the Craftsman form saw near-universal use in working-class home construction during the 1910s and 1920s. Larger, high-style examples were less common, but still saw frequent use in many areas. Gettysburg generally followed this national design trend, and a number of small and mid-sized Craftsman homes remain in the community. The Curran house is a fine local example of the form, larger than most and with a high level of design detail. It remains today strongly reflective of the period in which it was built.
It has also been known as the Herbert G. Beath House and the Carl and Dorothy Cronin House.

Physiotherapy in Nepal

Nepal currently only has two physiotherapy programs that are available through Kathmandu University and 
Pokhara University as a bachelor's degree. It is equivalent to four-and-a-half years of full-time study. The minimum level of education to start this program is upper secondary.
Practicing physical therapists.
Titles for practicing therapist is Physiotherapist and भौतिक चिकित्सक (Vautik Chikitshak) (protected by law).
Currently according to the World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT), there are an estimated 2000 practicing physiotherapists as of December 2017. There are 369 members of the national organization with the percentage of female physical therapists numbering at 42%. WCPT reports that there a total of 153,830 members organization for their Asia Western Pacific region of the organization. Support personnel are part of the workforce.
Regulation.
The scope of practice is defined by the Ministry of Health that has a regulated code of conduct. There is currently no legislation to prevent private practice clinics. Patients have direct access, meaning they can self-refer to private practice clinics without referral from another health care professional.
A physical therapist's scope in Nepal permits:
Registration is required to practice as a licensed physiotherapist in Nepal. Under the current code of ethics, continuing professional development is not required for re-registration and membership; however, the amendment of the code of ethics have incorporated a mandatory evidence of continuing professional development, which will soon come in action.
Role of physiotherapy after the earthquake.
On April 25 and May 12, 2015, two major earthquakes measuring 7.8 and 7.3 on the Richter scale struck Nepal. Out of the 75 districts of Nepal, 14 were severely affected by the earthquakes with an estimated 8600 deaths, 22,000 injuries and 505,000 homes completely destroyed. Post-disaster, health care facilities faced shortages in space and resources. Furthermore, patients facing discharge after acute care faced challenges of accessibility living in remote locations with limited health care services especially those requiring ongoing rehabilitation. With natural elements such as monsoon season, floods and landslides made access more difficult post-earthquake.
Injuries included traumatic cases due to falling debris and houses collapsing due to poor building construction and high population density in larger cities. 70% of injuries were fractures with a large number of patients suffering from spinal cord injuries (200-300), amputations (40-60) as well as traumatic brain injuries, crush injuries and neuropraxia.
During the time of the earthquake, 393 physiotherapists were registered with the majority of therapists located in Kathmandu. The role of physical therapist in disaster response was poorly defined with the profession being relatively new. Many physical therapists at the time worked in facilities treating patients with musculoskeletal conditions followed by neurology and rehabilitation with a small number in intensive care-unit, obstetrics and pediatrics.
In response to the earthquake, physical therapists worked alongside doctors, nurses and other heath providers with triage, screening and acute care management of patients. This would includes services such as brace fitting, applying plaster cases, temporary backslabs, skin traction for femoral fractures and hip dislocations, dressing wounds, fitting assistive devices. Physiotherapists also mobilized patients, prescribed exercises, re-positioned patients to prevent secondary complications such as bed sores and chest complications post-surgery or prolonged bed rest.

She works to extend beyond artwork that is solely in dialogue with European/American standards of what art is. Her work concerns ideas of gender, representation, cultural appropriation, diversity, race, and culture. She aims to find the intersection between the contemporary art world and politics, writing to acknowledge the imbalance in treatment in the art world between artists of color and white artists. Through her work, Vikram shows that while contemporary art has been a space for strong social justice outlooks, it does not quite get to a non-imperialist approach to curating work. In interviews she has spoken about sexism in art through a discussion of Carolee Schneeman. She has also spoken about racial disparity in the contemporary art world through a discussion of Isaac Julien.

Vikram has one published book, "Decolonizing Culture: Essays on the Intersection of Art and Politics". It was published in 2017 by "Art Practical" and Sming Sming Books. It is a collection of 17 of her essays, focusing on inclusion, diversity, and the lack thereof, in contemporary art.
She is also a contributor to "X-TRA", "KCET Artbound" and "DAILY SERVING", and has been published in "Hyperallergic", "Leonardo, SF Camerawork Journal", "Afterimage", "Artillery", "The Brooklyn Rail", and "Open Space", the blog of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Boost (material)

Boost is a trademarked polymer used by Adidas, in the form of pellets which are compressed and molded for various shoe models the company sells, especially the Ultraboost, Energy Boost and NMD lines of sneakers. The pellets consist of proprietary thermoplastic urethane (TPU) that is formed into a small pill shape. Adidas collaborated with the German chemical company BASF to develop this material. Boost in itself is not a raw material and its characteristic bounciness is obtained by processing the thermoplastic urethane. This material is claimed to be more comfortable on the wearer's feet.
History.
Prior to its first integration into the Adidas running line in 2013, this material was developed by chemists at BASF, BASF sold its product to Adidas who integrated it into the midsoles of certain lines of their shoes. This material, commonly known as "BOOST", is Adidas' preferred alternative to other industry standards such as ethylene vinyl-acetate.

The Average Woman

The Average Woman is a 1924 American silent melodrama film directed by Christy Cabanne and starring Pauline Garon, David Powell, and Harrison Ford. It was released on March 1, 1924.
Plot.
Sally Whipple is the daughter of the local judge, who dotes on her and gives in to almost her every whim. While at the library, she catches the interest of a newspaper man, Jimmy Munroe, who is writing an article on "the average woman". Sally fits his idea of what represents that woman, and he begins to follow her around, hoping to collect information for his story. His stalking is noticed, and he is arrested. Judge Whipple, finding him harmless, yet wanting to teach him a lesson, sentences him to regularly visit Sally. During these visits a romance develops between the two.
Rudolph Van Alten is the owner of a local notorious speakeasy, although he keeps his involvement in the club secret. He also begins courting Sally, although he has an ulterior motive. He has come into the possession of some letters written by the Judge's wife, which he thinks will embarrass the judge if they become public. He and his lover Mrs. La Rose, who is also the hostess at his nightclub, intend to use the letters to blackmail the judge. When Sally finds out of his plans, she offers to marry him if he will agree to turn over the letters.
When La Rose overhears Van Alten seducing the young girl, she becomes jealous and calls the police, who raid the club. The Judge and Jimmy also arrive at the club, saving Sally from the raid, and in the chaos which ensues La Rose shoots and kills Van Alten, and then makes her escape. Sally and Jimmy marry.
Production.
C. C. Burr announced in late February 1923 that it had secured the rights to Dorothy De Jagers' short story, "The Average Woman". The story had appeared in the edition of April 8, 1922 of "The Saturday Evening Post". In November 1923 it was announced that film would be one of the films produced during the winter of 1923-24. On December 9, 1923 Burr revealed that the following actors had been cast in the picture: Harrison Ford, David Powell, Pauline Garon, De Sacia Mooers, Burr McIntosh, William Tucker, and Russell Griffin. It was Powell's first appearance in an independent film in several years. The movie began filming in early December 1923, with Christy Cabanne at the helm. In early January 1924, it was announced that Pauline Garon had been selected to play the lead in the film. It was also learned that Coit Albertson was in the cast. The picture was filmed at Burr's Glendale studio, which was located in Glendale, Queens. By February 23 the editing on the film had been completed. While the American Film Institute's film catalogue gives a release date of March 1, 1924, "The Film Daily" has a release date of February 3.
Burr had originally intended to distribute the film as part of a several picture deal through Associated Exhibitors, but in October 1923 he terminated that deal, agreeing to distribute the films through the state rights market. The distribution rights for South America were sold to Sociedad General Cinematografica, while the Liberty Film Company were awarded the distribution rights for Cuba. In May, the distribution rights for France, Switzerland, and Belgium were sold to Societie Cinematographique for France, Belgium and Switzerland.
Reception.
"The Film Daily" gave the film a positive review, although they felt the story line was trite. They enjoyed Garon's performance, and also gave good marks to Cabanne's direction and the cinematography of Brown and Sullivan. While they felt the story trite, they called the screenplay by Harris "very good". "Motion Picture News" gave the film a slightly positive review. They enjoyed Cabanne's direction, and called the production a "simple story, treated with considerable discretion, smoothly and logical told." They highlighted the acting work of Powell and McIntosh, and especially praised Mooers work as the vengeful hostess (Mrs. LaRose). They felt Ford's work was flat, and thought that Garon's performance worked at times, particularly during the romantic sequences, but left something to be desired in other places.
Notes.
After the film's release, the author of the short story, Dorothy De Jagers, sued C. C. Burr over a disagreement regarding her rights to have a say in the final cut of the film. A court awarded her $900, which would have been her pay for work on six reels of film. During the film's production, rumors began to spread that Garon had become engaged to Gene Sarazen, the professional golfer. In March 1924 she issued a complete denial of the rumors.

Russian presidential elections

Russian presidential elections determine who will serve as the President of Russia for the next six (formerly four from 1996 to 2012 and five from 1991 to 1996) years.
Since the establishment of the position of the President of Russia in 1991, the presidential elections have taken place seven times: in 1991, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2018. The next presidential election is scheduled for March 2024.
Electoral legislation.
Russian presidential elections are governed by the Russian Constitution, the Federal law on basic guarantees of electoral rights and the right to participate in referendums of citizens of the Russian Federation and the Federal law on Presidential elections of the Russian Federation. The provisions of the electoral legislation were constantly evolving, but the foundations of the electoral system remained unchanged.
Laws on elections of the President of Russia were adopted 4 times. From 1991 to 2003, before each election a new law was adopted: in 1991, in 1995, in 1999 and in 2003. Currently, there is a Federal law "on Presidential elections of the Russian Federation" #19-FZ from January 10, 2003, in the version from December 5, 2017.
Candidates.
Eligibility.
Russian Constitution sets out the following requirements for presidential candidates:
In addition, the Federal Law "On the elections of the President of the Russian Federation" sets additional requirements, according to which, candidates may not be persons:
Gender.
From all candidates for President of Russia, only 3 were female candidates. These were Ella Pamfilova in 2000, Irina Hakamada in 2004 and Ksenia Sobchak in 2018. In addition, there were other women who ran for president, but for one reason or another were not registered.
Perennial candidates.
From all candidates, eight candidates participated in the elections more than once (of these, only two each time won the election, Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin). The record for participation in the elections is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who six times participated in the elections, from the first election in 1991 to 2018 (except 2004 election). Gennady Zyuganov and Vladimir Putin were candidates four times each. Aman Tuleyev and Grigory Yavlinsky — three times, while in 1996 Tuleyev withdrew his candidacy a few days before the election, and Yavlinsky also tried to run in 2012, but was rejected. Boris Yeltsin and Sergey Mironov — twice.
Procedure.
Nomination of candidates.
Candidates can be nominated by a political party or run as independents. To officially nominate candidates, a party congress (for party candidates) or an initiative group meeting (for independent candidates) must be held. In any case, regardless of the method of nomination, a candidate must submit to the CEC consent to be nominated by a specific political party or a specific initiative group.
Political party.
To be nominated by a political party, a party congress must be held. At least one delegate from at least half of the federal subjects (i.e. at least 46 delegates) is required to nominate a candidate.
A political party can only nominate one candidate. Also, the same candidate can only be nominated by one political party. At the same time, political parties may not nominate candidates at the congress, but may decide to support a candidate nominated by another party or an independent candidate. However, in this case, such party "de jure" will not participate in the election campaign, it will not be indicated in ballots, information stands and other official documents.
Candidates nominated by political parties with factions in the State Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament) or in legislatures at least one-third of the federal subjects are exempt from collecting signatures and are automatically included in the ballots.
All candidates from other political parties must gather 100,000 signatures.
Independent candidates.
To nominate an independent candidate, a meeting of the initiative group of voters must be held. The initiative group must consist of at least 500 Russian citizens who have the right to vote. At the same time, unlike political party congresses, initiative groups do not require representation of federal subjects (all members of the group can be residents of the same federal subject).
To participate in the election, an independent candidate must gather 300,000 signatures.
Popular vote.
The elections are held on the second Sunday of the month when the previous elections were held. If this day coincides with a day preceding a holiday day, or this Sunday falls on the week including a public holiday or Sunday is duly announced a work day, elections are called for the next Sunday.
The president is elected by direct popular vote in a two-round majoritarian contest: if no candidate receives over 50% of the vote in the first round, the two candidates with the most votes advance to a run-off. The second (run-off) round is held exactly three weeks after the first. The second round shall appoint with the written consent of the candidate to participate in the second round. If, prior to the second round, one of the registered candidates to be voted on has withdrawn his candidacy or has left it for other reasons, his / her place shall, by the decision of the Central Election Commission, be transferred to the next registered candidate by the number of votes obtained. A new candidate shall be put to the vote if there is a written Declaration of consent to participate in the second round of elections. Such application must be submitted to them no later than the second day after the departure of the candidate who initially participated in the second round. In this case, the voting shall be held on the first Sunday after 14 days from the date of application. At the end of the second round, the candidate with a simple majority of votes is considered elected. The second round can be held and one candidate, if after the departure of the remaining candidates will be only one. In this case, the voters must vote "for" or "against" the candidate. At the same time, the candidate is considered elected if he has received at least 50 percent of the votes. Otherwise, the election campaign starts again and new election are held.
Election calendar.
The typical periods of the presidential election process are as follows, with the dates corresponding to the 2018 election:
Video surveillance of the elections.
In December 2011 Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin proposed the Central Election Commission and the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications to ensure the surveillance procedures of voting and counting of votes in the presidential elections. According to the technical task set by the CEC, 91,400 election stations were covered by the video monitoring system. Two cameras were installed on each section. One passed the General plan, the second — directly to a ballot box. A total of 182,800 cameras were installed. Public access to election observation was carried out on a special web site. To view the videos of voting and counting votes, users must select the election stations from which they want to receive broadcasts on the day of voting.
The video surveillance system is used in the 2018 election. So cameras are installed on 80% of election stations. In addition, the chambers were installed for the first time in the territorial election commissions, which carry out the counting of votes at the level of cities and districts.

1968 Italian Senate election in Lombardy

Lombardy elected its fifth delegation to the Italian Senate on May 19, 1968. This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1968 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race.
The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua preferred the Italian Communist Party.
Background.
Following the alliance between Christian Democracy and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), which entered into Aldo Moro's centre-left governments, the PSI created a federation with another member of the coalition, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, but it paid its toll to the Italian Communist Party, which joined its forces with the newly established Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity, the former Socialist leftist wing.
Electoral system.
The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected.

Kärt Tomingas

Kärt Tomingas (born 5 April 1967) is an Estonian stage, television, voice and film actress, singer, lecturer and acting and theatre pedagogue. Tomingas' career began in the 1980s as a folk-pop, rock and jazz singer and soon after began a career as an actress. Since 2008, she has been an acting lecturer and has taught acting.
Early life and education.
Kärt Tomingas was born in Tallinn to architect Rein and Tamara Tomingas ("née" Palm). She has a sister Triin and two paternal half-siblings. After her parents divorced when she was young, she moved with her mother and sister to Keila to live with her grandmother where she attended primary and secondary schools, graduating from Keila Gymnasium in 1985.
In 1986, she enrolled at the Tallinn Conservatory (now, the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre) to study acting and graduated in 1990. She received her master's degree in theatre from the academy in 2006.
Career.
Singing.
Kärt Tomingas began her career as a singer, primarily of folk-pop, pop music and jazz with the ensemble Park, just after graduating from secondary school. She recorded her first singles in 1987. Her first solo album, "Korallid", was released in 1992 on the Estonian Theka label. Her second solo album, "Sinine Kivi", was released in 2003. In 2017, her third solo studio album, "Tähistus", was released. Tomingas has also recorded music for compilation albums with Park. In 2004, a "best of" album titled "Korallid: Laulud aastatest 1987-93" was released by the Estonian label Vinge Records.
Since 2016, Tomingas has been performing with the Kärt Tomingas Trio, composed of Tomingas (vocals), and musicians Külli-Katri Esken (keyboards), and Meelis Süt (percussion). Esken and Süt had previously recorded music with Tomingas while they were members of the band Park.
Acting.
Shortly after graduation from the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre in 1990, Tomingas was engaged as stage actress at the Vanemuine theatre in Tartu, departing in 1992. Afterwards, she relocated to Helsinki, Finland, where she performed as an actress at the Helsinki City Theatre and the Lilla Theatre from 1994 until 1999. In 2000, she garnered the role of Siiri in the Aleksi Mäkelä-directed Finnish drama feature film "Lomalla" for Solar Films. From 2005 until 2007, she played the role of Heili Reek, an Estonian hairdresser, in the Finnish television drama series "Kotikatu", which aired on Yle TV1.
Tomingas' first role in an Estonian film was the small role as Marta in the 1991 historical drama "Surmatants", directed by Tõnu Virve. In 1992, she appeared as Lily in the Mati Põldre-directed biographical feature film "Need vanad armastuskirjad", for Freyja Film, about Estonian composer Raimond Valgre. The film was selected as the Estonian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 65th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. In 2014, Tomingas appeared in the role of Pille in the Mihkel Ulk-directed drama feature film "Nullpunkt", based on the 2010 novel of the same name by Estonian author Margus Karu.
In 1999, Tomingas appeared in the Eesti Televisioon (ETV) television drama film "Stella Stellaris", directed by Ain Prosa and appearing opposite actors Ülle Kaljuste and Evald Hermaküla. The film was based on the 1927 short short story "Thea", from the collection of short stories "Anne-Marie", by writer August Mälk. In 2010, Tomingas appeared in the Ilmar Raag-directed drama miniseries "Klass: elu pärast", which aired on ETV2. The miniseries was a follow up on the aftermath of the 2007 feature film "Klass" in which two students (played by Pärt Uusberg and Vallo Kirs) commit a school shooting after enduring severe bullying. Tomingas played the role of Kaatariina, the mother of murdered secondary school bully Anders (played by Lauri Pedaja in the original film). In 2012, Tomingas had a starring role as Evelin Erikson in the ETV drama miniseries "Alpimeja", which focuses on an investigation into a doping scandal after Estonia's women's Olympic swimming team are stripped of their medals.
Tomingas has also worked as voice actress, voicing many of the characters in the Estonian language dubbing of the 1990-1991 joint Japanese-Finnish-Dutch anime television series "Moomin", produced by Telecable Benelux BV and based on the "Moomin" novels and comic strips by the Finnish illustrator and author Tove Jansson and her brother Lars Jansson.

Eddy de Pretto

Eddy de Pretto (born 2 May 1993 in Créteil in the Val-de-Marne) is a French singer-songwriter and actor.
Early life.
Eddy de Pretto was born on 2 May 1993 and grew up in Créteil in the Val-de-Marne. His father is a truck driver and football fan; his mother a laboratory technician and an art lover. He sings about his native city in "Beaulieue". In an interview, he described his hometown:
At the age of twelve, he started lessons in theatre, singing, vocal technique and piano: "I took the TV remote for a microphone and operated a halogen lamp for lighting. So my mother suggested taking theatre lessons since I didn't excel at sport." He continued his education at the "Institut supérieur des arts de la scène" (ECM-ISAS, "Advanced Institute of Dramatic Arts") in Paris.
Acting.
Eddy de Pretto's first acting experiences were in TV advertisements, such as the role of a young Julius Caesar for CanalSat in September 2010, before entering into the theatrical and film worlds: the short films "Königsberg" by Philipp Mayrhofer in 2012 and "Vivre sa vie" by Paul D. Meyer in 2013 as well as an appearance in the feature film "Paulette" by Jérôme Enrico in the role of "the young hippy buyer", also in 2013.
Music career.
Between the ages of eighteen and nineteen he began to write songs. In his first public performance he sang R. Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly" at his local youth centre ("Maison des jeunes et de la culture"): "I was totally weak, ... so stressed out because there was a lot of rap and I didn’t fit into that genre at all," he said in an interview.
He participated in the Printemps de Bourges music festival, where he won the "Inouïs" ("unheard of, amazing") prize, and the "Bars en Trans" festival, and is a graduate of "inRocKs Lab 2016". In October 2017, he also took part in the "Festival Off Off Off" ("Nuits de Champagne" festival) in Troyes.
"Kid" and "Cure".
He released his first EP, entitled "Kid", on 6 October 2017. In the live performances of the EP he played sound clips from his iPhone connected with a cable. The only live musician at his concerts was a drummer.
In early January 2018, on the stage of the television program "Taratata", he sang "Comme un boomerang" in duet with Julien Doré, a song written by Serge Gainsbourg and previously performed by Dani and Étienne Daho in 2001.
In mid-January 2018, he launched "Random", the first song from his debut album , describing his heartaches.
Along with Gaël Faye and Fishbach, he was nominated for "Best Newcomer Stage Act" ("Groupe ou artiste révélation scène") at the 33rd "Victoires de la Musique" in 2018. Gaël Faye won the award.
In mid-February 2018, he introduced his song "Ego" with "a stripped down, mechanical instrumental", which the singer explained thus: "I set down the possibility of becoming unhinged because of the speed at which the project is going. By dint of hearing praise, the 'excess of self' implodes, and that's the risk I’m exposing here. The simple fear of degenerating into a fanaticism of the self through social media, endearments, and all other flattering signals that create this monster of ego."
On 2 March 2018, he released his first album , on CD, vinyl and in digital format. At the same time, the clip for "Normal" was unveiled, which took on stereotypes of sexual identity, fear of the other and homophobia: "An anger about people who were attacking me because they didn't like the person I embodied," he explained in the magazine "Têtu". A week after its release, the recording was ranked the number one best-selling album ahead of "Vous et moi" by Julien Doré, with 13,500 copies, "driving out" Grand Corps Malade from Fnac's Top French Albums listing.
"À TOUS LES BÂTARDS".
On 25 March 2021, he released his new album entitled À TOUS LES BÂTARDS, featuring his two previously released singles, Bateaux-Mouches and Désolé Caroline, alongside a COLORS SHOW performance of the song ‘Parfaitement’ which was released on YouTube ahead of the album’s release. The 16-track album featured an artwork given to de Pretto by a fan, the design of which shows the sketch of the artist’s head superimposed onto a yellow background, a trend continued from his previous album’s cover where he superimposed bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger’s arm onto an image of himself.
Personal life.
As alluded to in some of his songs, Eddy de Pretto does not hide his homosexuality: "I'm not militant. I don't want to be a standard-bearer. I just want to give an account of my life, my reality," he added in an interview. He defines himself as a "non-genre" artist. In the TV program "Taratata", broadcast on 15 December 2017, he explained that he was trying to examine masculinity and the hypermasculinity that made up part of his education. When Nagui asked him if he talked about homosexuality in his songs, he responded that that was in no way his goal. In this regard, speaking to "Les Inrockuptibles" the singer declared: "I try to speak about my personal history and to normalise it as much as possible. And not to highlight it saying I'm the first queer to link rap and French chanson".

Microbrand watches

Microbrand watches are wristwatches produced by independent watch companies that have an output of about 300–2000 watches per year.
History.
The term "microbrand" is usually synonymous with the microbrand watch industry, though it can also be more widely used to describe any small-scale brand that is likely only recognized in niche communities and among hobbyists.
The first microbrands debuted in the early to mid-2000s. With the advent of the Internet, brands were able to distribute watches directly to consumers within e-commerce, without taking on the overhead usually associated with luxury goods such as retail locations, marketing budgets, and other associated costs. 
As a result, the prices of microbrand watches are generally significantly lower than luxury-tier watches, despite being produced in the same factories. Many brands that started (or were revived) during this period are now called "legacy microbrands" within the watch enthusiast community.
Recently, there has a large uptick in the rise of microbrand watches and microbrands in general.

He played college football at Penn State and was drafted by Washington in the fourth round of the 2018 NFL Draft. Apke played free safety in college and his first three years in the NFL before transitioning to cornerback in 2021.
Early years.
Apke was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and grew up in nearby Mt. Lebanon Township. He attended Mt. Lebanon High School, where he participated in football, basketball, and track and field. Apke advanced to the PIAA State Track and Field Championships his junior and senior years. He was also the WPIAL Champion in the 100 meters in 2014, recording a time of 10.81 seconds. He was a three-year starter for the football team playing wide receiver and safety. During his junior and senior seasons Apke had 1,776 receiving yards and 20 touchdowns and on defense, 68 tackles with 3 interceptions. A 3-star recruit, Apke committed to Penn State over offers from Bowling Green, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, and Toledo. 
College career.
During his freshman season at Penn State, Apke played four games on special teams, totaling two tackles. In his sophomore year, he played in all 13 games, starting one. He finished the season with 26 total tackles, one forced fumble, and one pass deflection. During his junior season, Apke played in all 14 games starting one again. On October 1, he recorded a career high six tackles and one pass deflection in a win over Minnesota.
Prior to his senior season Apke was named a starter at safety by head coach James Franklin. In the season opener against Akron Zips, Apke had four tackles and was one of eight players to be a part of three-straight seasons with a shutout on the Nittany Lions roster. Also, he was one of three who played in all three of those games. Apke graduated with a degree in Criminology. Prior to playing in the 2017 Fiesta Bowl, he was one of twenty on the roster who graduated before the Bowl game.

Coming into the 2019 season Apke was expected to be a contributor on special teams. Through the first six weeks Apke had three tackles. In week 7 versus the San Francisco 49ers, Apke saw significant action on defense after an injury to starting safety Montae Nicholson.

She has been on the Greatist.com list of "100 Most Influential People in Health and Fitness" every year since 2015. She is based in Houston, Texas.
Early life.
Carrillo-Bucaram was raised in a multicultural household with a Lebanese mother and an Ecuadorian father. She says she was raised on traditional food and that has affected her health and later her activism. At the age of 16 she was diagnosed with hyperglycemia, meaning she had a high blood sugar condition, and the early stage of Type 2 diabetes. She claims that her Hyperglycemia caused her to become emaciated weighing in at only while standing tall.
Carrillo-Bucaram did her undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University and later graduated from Rice University in 2009 with the summa cum laude distinction and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa for completing at least 90 semester hours in courses that reflect "learning for its own sake." She graduated with majors in kinesiology, health science, and vocal performance and briefly studied abroad in Costa Rica focusing on agriculture.
Health struggle and diet.
Carrillo-Bucaram met John Rose, a raw foods coach, at age 18 in a Whole Foods supermarket. He described raw veganism to her and this interaction inspired her to go raw vegan on July 15, 2005. She ate peaches for two weeks straight when she first went raw vegan.
She has made health-related claims such as that going raw will change your eye color, and has promoted the discredited practice of Iridology. When interviewed by Yahoo News, she said her eyes changed color because she claims eating a raw vegan diet "clears out all the gunk in your colon."
Raw vegan movement and businesses.
While attending university she started her own farmer's market on her campus. It was intended to be an alternative to expensive grocery stores and appeal to college students who may not be able to afford produce and other groceries otherwise. Running the campus farmer's market helped her cultivate a relationship with local farmers and produce distributors and lead her to open her own grocery cooperative called Rawfully Organic in September 2007.
Rawfully Organic.
At its height, Rawfully Organic served 50,000 people at three different locations in the Houston area and was the largest organic produce cooperative in the United States. At the food co-op, people ordered their produce in advance then picked up their order after all of it has been assembled into boxes. Order pick-ups occurred at the Houston Arboretum and Nature Center on Tuesdays, at the Nottingham Forest Club on Thursdays, and at the Bissonett location on Saturdays. In 2014, a doctor in Houston, Dr. Garth Davis, started prescribing his patients "raw fruits and vegetables." Dr. Davis received a grant from the Memorial Hermann Health System and partnered with Carillo-Bucaram. His patients would pick up their prescription not from a pharmacy but from the Rawfully Organic co-op each week and paid very little for the produce by showing their prescription to the co-op. In 2016, CBS named Rawfully Organic as one of the top spots to get produce. After almost 11 years of operation, the Rawfully Organic co-op closed its doors in 2017.
After four years of being closed, Rawfully Organic reopened temporarily in April 2020 to help get produce to people who didn't feel safe going to grocery stores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reopening was also an attempt to revitalize the Houston Farmer's Market that had been failing for some time. However, Carrillo-Bucaram doesn't see Rawfully Organic staying open after the pandemic because there's too much competition from major grocers like Whole Foods.
FullyRaw Juice.
This is a sister company to Rawfully Organic that sells fully raw juices. She founded it in 2013 using a Kickstarter campaign to help cover the cost of the start up. She raised $35,000. She sells cold-pressed fruits and vegetables.
FullyRaw website.
FullyRaw is a website she founded to coach people on how to start and maintain a raw vegan diet. She provides webinars, programs, and in person health coaching. She has done several "challenges" for a period of time where she offers meal plans, workouts, and advice through her website if you pay to join the "challenge."
Book.
On January 5, 2016 Carrillo-Bucaram wrote and published a book entitled "The Fully Raw Diet: 21 Days to Better Health, with Meal and Exercise Plans, Tips, and 75 Recipes". As the title suggests, the book contains meal plans, workouts, and recipes but it also contains the story of her health journey. The book became a number one seller on Amazon.
YouTube.
Carrillo-Bucaram has gained much of her recognition from her growing YouTube channels and other social media. She has one million followers on Instagram and has gained more than 90 million views across her YouTube channels.
Speaking engagements.
Carrillo-Bucaram has hosted and given speeches at the "Woodstock Fruit Festival" for many years on and off since 2010. She also has given talks at the annual "Texas Veggie Fair" for several years since 2013.

List of Confederate states by date of admission to the Confederacy

A state of the Confederate States of America was one of the constituent entities that shared its sovereignty with the Confederate government. Confederates were citizens of both the confederal republic and of the state in which they resided, due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the Confederate government. Virginia was admitted into the Confederacy as a "commonwealth" rather than a "state". The Confederacy recognized 13 states, but Kentucky and Missouri were border states represented by governments-in-exile; their pre-war state legislatures never voted to secede, but the Confederacy recognized pro-South provisional governments there as legitimate.
States were the primary subdivisions of the Confederate States and possessed a number of powers and rights under the Constitution of the Confederate States, such as regulating intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state had its own constitution grounded in republican principles, and government consisting of executive, legislative, and judicial branches.
All states and their residents were represented in the Confederate States Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state was represented by two Senators, while Representatives were distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state was entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elected the President of the Confederate States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state.
Every new state was admitted pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the Confederacy's Provisional Constitution which required a simple majority vote in the Provisional Congress. Since the establishment of the Confederate States in 1861, the number of states expanded from the original seven to 13. Each new state had been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states. Under Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the permanent Constitution Congress had the authority to admit additional states into the Confederacy, but unlike the United States and Provisional Confederate Constitutions which required a simple majority vote admission of new states to the Confederacy required a two-thirds vote in each House with the Senators from each state voting jointly. 
The following table is a list of all 13 states and their respective dates of statehood. The first seven became states in February and March 1861 upon agreeing to the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States, and each joined the permanent Confederation of states between March 12 and April 22, 1861, upon ratifying the Constitution of the Confederate States, its permanent constitution (a separate table is included below showing Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States adoption dates). These seven states are presented in the order in which each ratified the permanent Constitution, thus joining the permanent government. The date of admission listed for Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, and Kentucky was the official date set by an act of the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States.
Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States adoption dates.
A provisional congress made up of six Southern states meeting at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, Alabama, approved the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States on February 8, 1861. On February 22, 1862, the temporary government under the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States was replaced with a permanent federal government under the Confederate States Constitution.

Virginia Jaramillo (artist)

Virginia Jaramillo is an American artist of Mexican heritage. Born in El Paso, Texas, she studied in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. She has exhibited in exhibitions internationally since 1959.
Education and early career.
Jaramillo was raised in Los Angeles, California, where she attended the Manual Arts High School before attending the Otis Art Institute (now called Otis College of Art and Design) in 1958. She moved her family to New York City after the 1965 Watts riots.
Jaramillo's art has been primarily concerned with materials, and she states that "partly fuelled by her Mexican-American heritage," her "personal and artistic life has been a political statement." Her experiences led to her involvement in various feminist projects, such as the Third World Women issue of journal, and working on the board of the Feminist Art Institute.
Mid-career.
Jaramillo was selected for participation in the 1971 DeLuxe Show in Houston, Texas. "The DeLuxe Show was one of the first racially integrated exhibitions in the United States" and included artists such as Sam Gilliam, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski. During the 1970s she continued to exhibit. Group shows included participation in the Whitney Annual at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1972. Solo exhibitions were held at the Douglas Drake Gallery in Kansas City, and the Soho Center for Visual Artists in 1976.
Later recognition.
In 2011, Jaramillo participated in "Now Dig This! Art &amp; Black Los Angeles" at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. In 2017 she was exhibited in "We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women 1965-85" at the Brooklyn Museum in New York and in Tate Modern's "Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power" (12 July–22 October 2017, London, UK).
The Brooklyn Museum purchased Jaramillo's 1971 painting "Untitled" in 2017 through the Frieze Brooklyn Museum Fund. Initially produced for the 1971 DeLuxe Show, at the time of auction this painting - along with three others by Jaramillo - had not been seen in 40 years.

Gerlach and Ely Instructional Design Model

The Gerlach And Ely Instructional Design Model.
The Gerlach and Ely model emphasizes the cycle nature of instructional design.
The authors wanted to design a model which explained each component of the teaching and learning process while at the same time examining the relationship between the media and instruction. The model consists of ten elements and was constructed for teachers who both design and deliver instruction. The model is clearly defined and easily understood.
The Designers of the model.
The Gerlach and Ely instructional design model was developed by Vernon S. Gerlach and Donald P. Ely (1930 – 2014). Gerlach is an American Educator and writer who authored and co-authored books in the field of Education. Dr. Ely was an American professor and director of ERIC Clearinghouse on information and technology at Syracuse University. Dr. Ely also published and co-authored several journal articles and books and founded the ERIC Clearinghouse on information and technology. As an Educator, he was an advocate for instructional technology. Gerlach and Ely co-authored "Teaching and the media, A systematic Approach" (1971) where they introduced the Gerlach and Ely Instructional design model.
Overview of the model.
The model can be described as a mix of linear and concurrent activities that contains several steps which are seen as simultaneous.
In education, the model is suitable for primary, secondary and tertiary levels and can be implemented with limited resources available to teachers. The model is most suitable for instructional planning and designing where objectives and content are predetermined. Both objectives and content are also synchronize and are the starting point of instruction. The model includes strategies for selecting and including multimedia during instruction. It is one of the few models that recognizes content orientation of many teachers. In the field of education, the model “has stood the test of time and has continued to serve the classroom teacher well”.
Steps in the model.
Step One 
Step Two 
Step Three 
Step Four 
Step Five 
Step One.
The first task of the Gerlach and Ely instructional design model is the specification of content and objectives. This is done simultaneously since both content and objectives interact with each other. It is essential that the teacher indicates the reason for teaching the specific content and the medium in which the content will be used to achieve the objectives. The teacher is responsible for selecting the area of content to be taught and determining when it should be taught
The content is selected from the curriculum. The teacher also takes into consideration the state/local guidelines, personal experiences, goal or preferences of supervisor. The objectives must be measurable and written as specific skills that learners should display under specific conditions and time.
Step Two.
The second step is the assessment of entering behavior. At this stage, the teacher needs to determine the present skills and prerequisite knowledge of learners. Gerlach and Ely (1980) explained that the teacher must ask the question, “To what extent has the student learned the terms, concepts and skills which are part of the course?” The teacher can determine the starting knowledge of each learner by using a variety of methods such as giving a pretes). Gerlach and Ely were advocates of pretesting; they believed that teachers should breakdown content into units and give learners a pretest at the beginning of each unit.
Step Three.
In this model there are five tasks which occurs simultaneously: 
Step four.
The fourth step in this model is the evaluation of performance. Evaluation of performance is focused on the measurement of students’ performance and the attitude of students towards the content. In other words, the teacher must determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the instruction.
Step Five.
The final step in the model is the analysis of feed back. A formative revision is done to complete the process. At this point the teacher will inform the students about their performance.

The John Blewett House, located at 2411 E. River St. in Fromberg, Montana, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
It was deemed significant in part for its architecture, asone of the most distinguished examples of vernacular architecture from Fromberg's boom period. The two-story brick house's straightforward massing is enlivened by a complex combination roof, sandstone foundation and window headers and lintels, and the wrap around front porch. The house serves as an excellent representation of a type of large, architecturally sophisticated house common to the period and remains as the most impressive house ever built in the Blewett Addition.

Fortuna Silver Mines

Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. is a Canadian public silver mining company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It has two operating mines, one in Peru and one in Mexico, and a mine under construction in Argentina. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, with a C$893 million market capitalization as November 2017.
History.
Fortuna was founded in 2004 by Jorge Ganoza and Simon Ridgway. Ganoza is from a Peruvian mining family. Fortuna acquired its Caylloma property in 2004, and started production in 2006. Also in 2006, it acquired the land necessary for its San José del Progreso mine in Mexico. Construction on the mine began in 2010, with production starting in 2011. 
In 2016, Fortuna acquired Goldrock Mines for C$129 million, for that company's Lindero silver project in Argentina. In November 2017, the company announced it would move forward with construction at its Lindero project.
Operations.
Fortuna has two operating mines:
Fortuna also has a gold mine under construction at its Lindero project in Salta, Argentina.
Controversy.
Fortuna was involved in an ongoing dispute with opponents of its San Jose mine. In 2009, there was a two-month long blockade at the company's San Jose mine, with protesters worried about industrial contamination. The blockade lasted from March to May, and was eventually broken up by state police, leading to 19 arrests. In January 2012, opposition increased, due to concerns that the mine was improperly accessing the local water supply. In March 2012, Bernardo Vasquez, the leader of an opposition group to the mine, was shot and killed. One other anti-mine activist was killed in the same year, with three others injured by gunfire. The company denies responsibility for the violence, saying that it was the result of pre-existing social divisions.

Walton-Wiggins Farm

The Walton-Wiggins Farm is a historic farmhouse in Springfield, Tennessee, U.S..
The house was built circa 1855 for Dr. Lycurgus B. Walton, a physician and slaveholder. His son, Martin Atkinson Walton, graduated from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and took over his father's medical practise in the house. He lived there with his wife, Elizabeth Henry Woodard, and their six children. One of his daughter, Eva, married John Bynum Wiggins, and the farm was subsequently inherited by their descendants. By the 1980s, the owner was John Bynum Wiggins III, and the farm was used for "livestock cattle, soybeans, tobacco, corn and wheat."
The house was designed in the Colonial Revival architectural style, with Greek Revival features. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since August 8, 1997.

History.
The first six units were built in 1855 for the Strade Ferrate dello Stato Piemontese (SFSP), where they carried the numbers 99-104. Five years later, in 1860, three similar locomotives were built for the Victor Emmanuel Railway (VE).

In 1885, with the creation of the great national networks, the machines were assigned to the Rete Mediterranea (RM), where they assumed the numbers 2707-2715. In 1905, at the establishment of the Italian State Railways (FS), 8 units were still in operation, and they were classified as Class 111 with the numbers 1111-1118.

The Alberta Teachers House is a historic house in Alberta, Minnesota, United States. It was built in 1917 to provide urbane, apartment-like housing for faculty of the adjacent school as part of the era's efforts to modernize rural education. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for having local significance in the themes of education and social history. It was nominated for its associations with a key period in the development of Minnesota's rural education system. At the time the state's numerous one-room schoolhouses were being consolidated into fewer, larger facilities centered in towns and cities. The Alberta Teachers House was an experiment by the General Education Board, a national philanthropic foundation, intended to engender community building and make rural teaching posts more appealing.

Dengiz Beg Rumlu

Dengiz Beg Rumlu (died 1613) was a Turkoman courtier from the Rumlu tribe, who served as merchant-envoy to Habsburg Spain during the reign of Safavid king ("shah") Abbas I (1588–1629).
Biography.
In late 1609, Abbas I sent the Portuguese diplomat and missionary Antonio de Gouvea (now in Safavid service) back to Spain and Rome in order to construct an alliance against the common enemy; the Ottoman Turks. Dengiz Beg Rumlu, merchant by profession, was assigned to accompany de Gouvea as merchant-envoy with some 100 bales of raw silk.
At the Spanish court of Philip III (1598–1621), where they arrived in 1611, a major misunderstanding arose; Dengiz Beg had sold more than half of the total bales of silk for his own profit. De Gouvea, without any sort of compromise with the Iranian government, suddenly offered the remaining number of silk bales as a gift to the Spanish king, even though the Iranians had intended to sell them as a sample of the silk they intended to deliver in the future. De Gouvea and Dengiz secured a trade agreement with Philip III, but it proved to be of no value for the Spanish government never adopted it. They also urged for a blockade of the Red Sea, but they were reportedly "no more successful" in this than Robert Shirley.
Conform Abbas I's desire, at the Spanish court, Dengiz Beg Rumlu supported the elevation of de Gouvea to the rank of bishop of Cyrene and Apostolic vicar of the Armenians of the royal capital of Isfahan.
Dengiz Beg and de Gouvea set sail for Safavid Iran from Lisbon in March 1612 with gifts and presents from the Habsburg crown. Dengiz Beg received a coat of mail and a specific sword which he himself had requested from Philip III. He also received a gold chain, a gold sword, a portrait of Philip III decorated with numerous costly gems, as well as some horse trappings which he liked to have.
In the spring of 1613, Dengiz Beg appeared at the Iranian court. Reportedly, as he went down on his knees to kiss the king's foot, Abbas kicked him and ordered for his execution. It appears that king Abbas had appointed a person in Dengiz's suite to spy on him in Europe, for Abbas was already aware of Dengiz's wrongdoings before his presentation at court. Amongst others, Dengiz Beg was accused of treating the members of his mission extremely bad; this had resulted in some of them converting to Christianity and staying in Europe. Abbas' anger with Dengiz Beg was most likely increased by Philip III's meager responses and actions and for "reawakening" his dissatisfaction with the Portuguese occupation of Hormuz. When Abbas then also found out that the silk had been given to Philip III as a gift rather than being sold, he became furious. When Abbas later received de Gouvea, he also discovered that Dengiz Beg had received nothing of equal value in return; the presents and goods were all a gift, and not payment for the silk; and they were, reportedly, not even nearly as costly as the bales of silk that de Gouvea had given to Philip III.
Dengiz Beg was executed in 1613. It remains unclear what the precise reason was; it may be that his role in the "silk affair" proved to be the straw that broke the camel's back.

 is a 2015 Japanese drama film directed by Ryūsuke Hamaguchi.
Plot.
The film follows the lives and loves of four middle-class women in their thirties who are friends and who live in Kobe. When one reveals she is undergoing divorce proceedings, the others begin to rethink their relationships.
Production.
The film was first developed while Hamaguchi was an artist in residence at KIITO Design and Creative Center Kobe in 2013. It came out of an improvisational acting workshop he held for non-professionals, with many of the film's performers having participated in the workshop.
Release.
The film had its world premiere at the 68th Locarno Festival on 14 August 2015. It was released in Japan on 12 December 2015.
Reception.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 14 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
The four lead actresses shared the best actress award and the film earned a special mention for its script at the 2015 Locarno Film Festival. The film was voted the third best Japanese film of 2015 in the Kinema Junpo poll of critics. Upon its release in the United States, Richard Brody of "The New Yorker" wrote that "Hamaguchi is a genius of scene construction, turning the fierce poetry of painfully revealing and pugnaciously wounding dialogue into powerful drama that’s sustained by a seemingly spontaneous yet analytically precise visual architecture". He selected the film as one of the 10 best of 2016, and later as the best Japanese film of the 21st century. Vadim Rizov also held the latter opinion, saying, "The logline is that it’s a drama about five Japanese women charting their friendship, using duration to build character depth, and that’s absolutely true, but there’s so much more". Dan Sullivan in "Film Comment" stated, "Buoyed by four captivating performances from its unheralded actresses, "Happy Hour" is a fascinating, towering confection of contradictions". Ben Konigsberg in "The New York Times" wrote that "If 'Happy Hour' doesn't quite deliver all it promises, that may only be because it promises quite a lot".
The film was placed at number 85 on "The A.V. Club"s "100 Best Movies of the 2010s" list, number 27 on "Slant Magazine"s "100 Best Films of the 2010s" list, and number 94 on "IndieWire"s "100 Best Movies of the Decade" list.

World Obstacle

World Obstacle, institutional name "Fédération Internationale de Sports d’Obstacles" "(FISO)", is the international governing body for obstacle sports and related events. Disciplines include Ninja (similar to American Ninja Warrior), Obstacle Course Racing (OCR), and Adventure Racing (AR). Headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, it sanctions world and continental level events.
History.
The concept of an international governing body for Obstacle Racing was originally proposed by Joe DeSenna, the founder and owner of Spartan Race. This was announced in May, 2014 when world champion adventure athlete Ian Adamson accepted the job of leading the federation and sport, originally called the International Obstacle Racing Federation.
The organization filed as a Colorado non-profit sporting organization in early 2016 under the name the "International Obstacle Sports Federation (IOSF)." The decision was taken at the 4th Congress to establish headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland to better represent the majority of member federations and be close to GAISF, WADA, CAS, the majority of international sporting federations and the IOC.
In February 2018, the organization filed in Switzerland as World OCR, "the" "Fédération Internationale de Sports d’Obstacles" "(FISO)", following the naming convention used by many international governing bodies such as FINA, FIFA, FIBA, FIS, World Sailing, World Rugby, World Rowing, World Archery,
Technology investor and media right entrepreneur Matthew Joynes was appointed the inaugural Secretary General of World OCR, in 2018.
Inclusion of full medal events in the 2019 South East Asia Games was approved in December 2018. The SEA Games are under regulation of the Southeast Asian Games Federation (SEAGF) with supervision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). Six nations expressed intention to participate in the event. Four nations medaled, Philippines (10), Malaysia (4), Indonesia (3) and Laos (1)
World Obstacle signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Parkour Federation (IPF) in August 2020 to unify Obstacle Sports worldwide under a governance structure similar to Aquatics (FINA), and constitution modeled on FINA and the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). The MoU expired in December 2020.
In order to provide more autonomous governance of obstacle sports worldwide, World OCR changed its name to World Obstacle in October 2020. This provided a more inclusive name for the core sports of Ninja, OCR and Adventure Racing.

Dundee Park

Dundee Park is a suburban business park located in the town of Andover, Massachusetts, situated across from the old Andover train station.
History.
Originally known as the Smith &amp; Dove mills, the Dundee Park business strip took shape in the 18th century, helping bolster the Industrial Revolution in New England, prior to which the area and its economy was merely agriculturally-grounded. The Smith &amp; Dove mills, founded by Scottish merchants John Smith, Peter Smith, and John Dove in 1835, attracted more individuals to the Andover, Massachusetts area seeking work, and made common goods more available. Nearly a century later, a myriad of individual mills had been erected in the area, focused primarily on textile development. A notable cotton mill was commissioned in 1807 by Abraham Marland, an Episcopalian merchant from Lancashire, known for his founding of Christ Church in Andover. The wool production operation headed by Paschal Abbott also shifted to the town around 1815, operating on Red Spring Road near Dundee Park, but was later sold to Smith &amp; Dove, the United States' original manufacturer of linen and benefactor of Memorial Hall Library, in 1843, upon a decline in demand for wool. The acquisition of this mill, in addition to a series of other mills, led to the area's colloquial name, the "Smith &amp; Dove mills". Approximately two decades after the purchase of Abbott's wool mill, the Smith &amp; Dove mills in Andover were successfully fabricating cloth and thread at a large volume.
The mills continued to expand, eventually becoming known collectively as Dundee Park. Soon, however, the company was purchased by Ludlow Manufacturing in 1927, after which the area was claimed by many companies and investors, most notably the Indian Ridge Company. Eventually, the Family Bank and Lawrence Savings assisted in repurposing Dundee Park, from a mill area to a business park. More than fifty years later, two new buildings were constructed in Dundee Park. At the turn of the century, property managing firm Ozzy Properties purchased a significant portion of the area, and helped allure start-ups and other businesses to it.
Businesses.
Dundee Park is home to a diverse number of start-ups, small businesses, and other companies.
Future of Dundee Park.
At a town meeting in May 2015, voters helped create the Historical Mill District, often abbreviated as the HMD, an area comprising Dundee Park and other local buildings and roads. Targeting Dundee Park as an area capable of smart growth, the Town of Andover, along with the HMD Task Force, discussed design guidelines in order to highlight Dundee Park's architectural and historic antiquity, as well as transform it into a productive, sprawling area. The guidelines, originally discussed on January 26, 2017, were officially adopted by the Andover Planning Board on February 13, 2018.

Barton (1794 ship)

Barton was launched in 1794 as a West Indiaman, sailing primarily to Barbados. She was of average size for vessels launched at Liverpool at that time. She sailed under letters of marque and several times repelled attacks by French and Spanish privateers. Still, the Americans captured and burnt her in 1814.
Career.
"Barton" entered "Lloyd's Register" as "Barten" in 1799 with Rd Hall, master, Barten &amp; Co, owner, and trade Liverpool–Barbados. The next volume of "Lloyd's Register" corrected her name and that of her owner, Barton &amp; Co.
Captain Richard Hall acquired a letter of marque on 7 April 1794. At some point he recaptured the brig "Mentor", of Aberdeen, which had been sailing from Lisbon with fruit when originally captured.
In March 1797 "Barton" and were sailing in company to Barbados when they parted. A Spanish privateer of 16 guns and 120 men came up and attacked "Barton". After about 20 minutes the Spaniard veered off, but proceeded to follow "Barton" all night at a distance of half a mile. Next morning, when "Agreeable" appeared, the Spaniard came up and engaged the two British merchantmen. The engagement lasted one hour and forty minutes before the Spaniard disengaged, having suffered extensive damage to her sails and rigging. British casualties consisted of two men wounded on "Agreeable".
Captain William Cutler acquired a letter of marque on 20 September 1798. A letter dated Barbados, 1 December 1799, reported that on 25 November "Barton" was about 20 leagues to windward of Barbados when an unknown vessel came up and shadowed "Barton" all night, despite "Barton" maintaining a regular fire from her stern chase guns. In the morning the vessel came up, showing herself to be a French privateer schooner of eighteen 6 and 9-pounder guns. A two-and-a-half hour running engagement ensued. The privateer withdrew to repair her rigging and then recommenced the attack and ran into "Barton" with the intent of boarding her. Cutler, who had massed his crew and passengers on the quarter deck, led the counter-attack. The British reported that they had speared many Frenchmen in "Barton"s netting and shrouds, and that "Barton"s cabin guns, which continued to fire, had caused casualties on the privateer's deck. The privateer, having sustained casualties in the unsuccessful attempt to board, and much damage to her rigging, broke off the attack. "Barton" had sustained four casualties: her mate and three seamen wounded.
Captain Cutler acquired a new letter of marque on 25 February 1800.
Captain George Chalmers acquired a letter of marque on 11 June 1803. Chaklmers was 23 years old when he became master. When "Barton" sailed from Liverpool the practice was to sail in the Channel and along the French coast for some six weeks looking for possible prey, before then sailing on to Barbados. He reports three engagements with French privateers. On 17 May 1806 as "Barton" was returning to Liverpool from Barbados she encountered a French privateer of 20 guns and 50 men, but apparently nothing much transpired. On 23 May "Barton" fell in with a French privateer of 10 guns that attempted to board, but clearly was unsuccessful. Then on 25 May "Barton" encountered the French privateer "Fairey", of 20 guns and 150 men. For an hour "Fairey" ranged 50 yards alongside, firing broadsides that "Barton"s crew responded only with small arms fire though her guns were loaded. When "Fairey" finally come alongside to board, "Barton"s crew fired her guns; they also cut down the French men attempting to board. "Fairey" sheared off, having sustained heavy casualties and damage to her rigging.
Captain John Ford acquired a letter of marque on 13 June 1806.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1810 showed "Barton" with J. Ford, master, changing to R. Burns, Irlam &amp; Co. owners, changing to Taylor &amp; Co., and trade London–Demerara. (Barton, Irlam and Higginson acquired a new that was twice the size of the one they had just sold.)
Captain Robert Burn acquired a letter of marque on 14 November 1809.
Captain James Hasler acquired a letter of marque on 31 December 1811.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1813 showed "Barton" with J. Hasler, master, Taylor &amp; Co., owners, changing to Clare &amp; Co., and trade Liverpool–Rio de Janeiro, changing to Liverpool–Africa. "Lloyd's Register" for 1814 confirms the change of ownership and trade.
Fate.
 captured and burnt "Barton", Hassler, master, on 28 May 1814. "Barton" was carrying a cargo of redwood, palm oil and ivory to St Thomas, Danish Virgin Islands. "Syren" took on board both "Barton"s crew and as much of her cargo as Captain Nicholson of "Syren" desired. The Americans then set her on fire. They delivered her crew to St Thomas, from where the crew went on "Jane", of Liverpool. Three crew members from "Barton" joined the Americans, a Portuguese and two "coloured men".
"Jane", Andersen, master, arrived at Liverpool in August 1814. She had sailed via Africa, which she had left on 6 June. Also, "Syren" had blockaded her at St Thomas for four weeks.

Preservation Creek is a Creek in northwest New South Wales west of the town of Malparinka.
The creek is 8.25km and flows from an elevation of 181m and drops to an elevation of 162m. The Nuggets Creek flows into the Preservation Creek.
History.
Charles Sturt camped for six months at Preseration Creek and it was here that James Poole died. His grave is seen there today. Of the event Sturt wrote "I little thought when I was engaged in the work that I was erecting Mr. Poole's monument, but so it was. That rude structure looks over his lonely grave, and will stand for ages as a record of all we suffered in the dreary region to which we were so long confined.
Sturt was expecting a vast inland sea in the inland regions and his expediting had carried boat with them. The boat was launched and abandoned at Preseration Creek when instead of a sea, they found a vast stony desert.

Peter August

Peter August is a fictional character from "General Hospital", an American soap opera on the ABC network, portrayed by Wes Ramsey. Peter is introduced as a media publisher in 2017, and is soon revealed to be the previously unknown son of Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) and Alex Marick (Finola Hughes).
Peter’s introduction garnered very mixed reactions from both critics and viewers alike. While most felt the story undermined Anna's long history and backstory, a few, including "ABC Soaps In Depth" actually liked the umbrella affect the story had on the canvas. Despite the critiques about Peter being Anna's son, many praised Ramsey for his "compelling" and "nuanced" portrayal of the character. "TV Insider" hailed the revelation of Peter's lineage as one of the "Best Moments" of the year, while "Michael Fairman TV" said Peter was the "Most Polarizing Character" of the season and "Soap Opera Digest" felt it was too big of a "rewrite" for fans to believe.
Storylines.
In 2017, Peter is hired by "Jason" (Billy Miller) and Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) as the COO of their newly acquired media company, Aurora Media, and becomes the boss of Nina Cassadine (Michelle Stafford) and Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). Aspiring journalist Lulu Falconeri (Emme Rylan) appeals to Peter for a job, and Peter advises her to bring him a "hard-hitting" story before he considers hiring her. With the revelation that the mysterious Patient 6 is the real Jason and Peter's boss is actually Jason's unknown twin brother Andrew Cain, Peter wants to capitalize on the drama, but Sam shoots down the idea. Peter is quite impressed when Lulu uncovers Mayor Janice Lomax (Shari Belafonte) stole the 2014 election, which leads to her resignation, but tells Lulu she needs an impressive follow story before he would put her on staff. Peter convinces Lulu to do a story on Cesar Faison (Anders Hove), the man responsible for switching Jason and Drew.
Although he is happy with Lulu’s article about Maxie's husband Nathan West (Ryan Paevey) being Faison's son, Peter isn't interested in a follow-up. Peter rejects a suggestion from Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) to plant a fake story about Faison's eldest son Henrik as a trap. Peter is nearly shot defending a pregnant Maxie from Faison. He survives, and helps Maxie care for Nathan, who is caught in the crossfire. Peter confronts a hospitalized Faison, and reveals himself to be Henrik. Peter admits he intentionally kept Jason alive to use him against Faison, and is further delighted when Faison dies from cardiac arrest upon hearing Nathan has died. 
Peter steals the flash drive with Drew's memories to conceal his identity. Peter changes his mind about leaving town, having bonded with the widowed Maxie. He is terrified to learn Faison suffered from Huntington's disease and confides in Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart), who convinces him to get tested. Peter is relieved when both he and Maxie's unborn child have not inherited the disease, but Nina accuses him of taking advantage of Maxie's grief. When his doctor Griffin Munro (Matt Cohen) confronts Peter about his identity, Peter convinces him to keep quiet for Maxie's sake. Against Valentin's wishes, Peter orders Lulu to write an article about Henrik, and even contacts her as Henrik. Peter warns Valentin to neutralize Anna and Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) when he learns they have been investigating Henrik. 
Peter is contacted by a woman claiming to be his mother, and agrees to meet her at the Nurses' Ball. Peter ends up delivering Maxie and Nathan's son, his nephew, James West. He goes to meet the mystery woman, and finds Anna. Peter is shocked when Anna stops Jason from killing Peter by announcing she is his mother. Peter rejects Anna as he is arrested. Peter is furious to learn Valentin stole him from his adopted family, and delivered him to Faison; he guilt trips him into breaking him out of jail. Peter tries to skip town when he is abducted by Nathan's distraught mother, Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati), who tries to torture him into confessing. After a failed escape attempt in which Obrecht breaks his hand, Peter appeals to Nina to let him go before she ends up in prison, along with Obrecht. Obrecht then moves Peter to the stables at Wyndemere Castle when she is nearly caught. She tries to kill Peter in a fire, but he is rescued by Anna's boyfriend, Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton). Finn stalls Peter’s arrest, refusing to release him from the hospital. To avoid prosecution, Peter trades information for his freedom. After his release, Peter coerces Valentin into giving him the money to buy local tabloid, "The Invader", and hires Lulu as a reporter. Peter continues bonding with Maxie after she helps him through a panic attack, and they spend her birthday together.
Peter continues thawing toward Anna, and supports her when she suddenly goes blind. Meanwhile, Peter and Maxie discover Obrecht is blackmailing Valentin about Sasha Gilmore (Sofia Mattsson), whom he claims is Nina's daughter. However, their secret DNA test proves their theory wrong. In April 2019, Peter takes Anna's advice and finally confesses his feelings for Maxie, and they soon start dating. 
Soon, convicted cult leader Shiloh (Coby Ryan McLaughlin) blackmails Peter into breaking him out of prison by threatening to reveal Peter's role in the abduction of Drew Cain from Afghanistan. When Drew leaves town, determined to get his memory back, Peter makes sure Drew's plane crashes to keep himself from being implicated. Peter even tries to kill Andre when he returns, looking for Drew. While Peter successfully breaks Shiloh out of prison, his attempt to eliminate him goes awry when Shiloh escapes from his hired henchman. Shiloh tries to blackmail Peter, only to end up dead after a confrontation with Sam. Peter frames Sam for Shiloh's escape, then hires an assassin to kill Andre and Franco Baldwin (Roger Howarth), but changes his mind and kills the assassin. Both Anna and Robert suspect that Peter is involved in the attempted assassinations, as well as Drew's death. To keep them from finding out the truth, Peter frames Obrecht for his crimes, which leads to her getting arrested and sent to prison. When Robert isn't convinced of Obrecht's guilt, Peter orders someone to provide a "distraction" for Robert, leading Holly Sutton (Emma Samms) to be presumed dead.
Soon after, during the Nurses' Ball, Maxie accidentally reveals that she's pregnant with Peter's child. Peter is overjoyed, and vows to be a better father to his child than Faison was to him. He and Maxie get engaged soon after. Anna and Valentin find out that Anna's sister, Alex Marick (Finola Hughes), is actually Peter's mother, not Anna. Alex returns to town, and kidnaps Maxie, but Anna manages to save her and shoot Alex, who is presumed dead. After Lulu is injured in a bombing and lapses into a coma, Maxie and Peter agree to name their unborn daughter Louise, to honor Lulu.
Valentin and Anna realize that Peter framed Obrecht, and kidnap him on his and Maxie's wedding day, hoping Maxie will think Peter stood her up. Peter escapes, though, and makes it to the ceremony. However, Obrecht crashes it, revealing she's been exonerated, and plays a tape Alex left behind, revealing she's Peter's mother. Peter is shocked and dismayed by this revelation, and is upset when Valentin &amp; Anna reveal they knew, and also expose his crimes. Maxie starts having contractions, and is rushed to the hospital. Peter is held back by Robert and others, but escapes and tries to make his way to the hospital. Franco, though, kidnaps him, having realized from Drew's memories embedded in him what Peter did to Drew. He tries to get Peter to confess to his crimes, but Peter breaks free and kills Franco in a struggle. He goes to Maxie, and tries to convince her that all the accusations are lies, but she doesn't believe him, and tells him to leave.
Peter continuously tries to get Maxie to give him a second chance, stalking her and becoming obsessed after she kicks him out of her apartment. When the police start investigating him, he teams up with mob boss Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober), who arranges to implicate Jason in Franco's death. Anna and Valentin, however, realize Peter is responsible, and try to find evidence. Peter covers his tracks, so Anna &amp; Valentin kidnap him to keep Maxie and her baby safe. However, Peter comes up with his own plan to keep Anna at bay, and tries to poison Finn. Instead, Finn's younger brother, Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard), winds up being poisoned. Anna is forced to let Peter go in order to get an antidote that will keep Chase alive. 
Peter demands Anna help him reconcile with Maxie, wanting to be there when his daughter is born. Anna convinces Maxie to meet Peter by revealing what he did to Chase. Peter suggests Maxie hire a live-in nurse to help out with her pregnancy, and Maxie agrees to find someone. However, when she finds a candidate, Peter replaces her with someone he hired to smuggle Maxie and her baby out of the country with Peter. 
Peter realizes the walls are closing in when Cyrus' plan falls apart. He has the nurse kidnap Maxie to deliver the baby so they can leave town together. Maxie, though, winds up getting away from the nurse, and ends up in the hospital, where Peter finds her. She tells him that her nurse kidnapped their daughter, Louise, after Maxie gave birth. Maxie confronts Peter about his various crimes, screaming that he put their daughter in danger. Peter vows to find Louise, but Maxie turns him in, having recorded their conversation. Peter leaves, vowing to find Louise. He heads to the roof, trying to escape, but is stopped by Finn, who wants the antidote to save Chase. Peter throws it off the roof, and a furious Finn runs after Peter and throws him down the stairs, killing him. He and Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst), Franco's widow, hide Peter's body in the hospital basement lab.
In July, Finn confesses to Anna that he killed Peter, but kept Elizabeth out of his confession. Finn leads Anna down to the basement lab where they open the freezer, only to find it empty. Finn is shocked, but Anna considers the possibility that Peter could still be alive. In August, Peter was revealed to be alive and has been stalking Maxie in Nixon Falls. He is surprised to see Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) alive, but realizes that Sonny has amnesia, so he introduces himself as Peter Sinclair, an author. When Sonny takes Peter inside to get him a glass of water, Peter and Nina see each other, which shocks Nina.
Development.
Casting and creation.
In October 2017, TVLine announced that Wes Ramsey, previously recognized for his portrayal of Sam Spencer on "Guiding Light", had been cast in the "mystery role" of Peter August. Besides his first air-date, no further details were made available at press time. Ramsey, who had recently become known to "General Hospital" fans as the boyfriend of Laura Wright – who plays Carly Corinthos – took to social media about his casting: "Port Charles is a dream come true!" Ramsey accompanied Wright to set one day and had a friendly encounter with executive producer Frank Valentini. A few months later, Ramsey came in to audition for the role of Peter. In 2009, Ramsey auditioned at "One Life to Live" where Valentini also served as executive producer. Ramsey felt he and Valentini had "unfinished business" after their first meeting in 2009. With his most recent stint in daytime being a short lived role at "Days of Our Lives", Ramsey turned to daytime once again because he missed the genre. "To tell you the truth, I felt better about this time and this role and this show than any other time in my career." Wright helped him prepare for the screen test. Ramsey competed against 8 other actors, and auditioned 3 times for the role. The actors, including Ramsey, auditioned with opposite Finola Hughes who plays Peter's mother, Anna.
Hughes concluded that Henrik/Peter's creation was a surefire way to, in the words of "ABC Soaps In Depth", "blow up" the canvas for so many characters. In an interview with "Soap Opera Digest", Ramsey explained that Peter was presented to him as a "much smaller role and throughout the course of a few weeks, grew into something else." Despite their hesitation, both Hughes and her co-star Tristan Rogers — who plays Anna's ex-husband Robert — agreed that the story of Peter's conception and birth would fit into the timeline without completely upending the history between their own characters.
In June 2021, Ramsey exited the role. Following a two month absence, Ramsey returned to the role during the final moments of the August 23 episode.
Characterization.
Personality.
Ramsey characterized Peter August to be a "genuinely good guy" as originally presented to the audience. But, Ramsey insisted, "He's no pushover!" Peter is "complicated, confusing and disturbing" the actor stated. Ramsey said that Peter "obviously believes he's capable of outwitting anyone." Ramsey's favorite thing about Peter is "his complexity." Peter "thinks he's invincible" Ramsey later said. As far as Peter is concerned, "there isn't a situation he could find himself in that he can't handle." Underestimating those around him is "hubris." Peter has consistently been described as a "puppeteer" or "puppetmaster." Ramsey further described Peter as a "master communicator and manipulator." Despite his apparent arrogance, Peter can also show "vulnerability," "sadness and weakness" when he has to.
"ABC Soaps In Depth" has described the character as "debonair" "mysterious" and "rather cocky." The magazine described Peter as an "educated, well-mannered, worldly guy." However, he is a "recovering villain." Hope Campbell of "Soap Hub" described Peter as the "mild-mannered infamous traitor." She continued, "he seems a little humdrum… kinda like Nathan." Janet Di Lauro of said Peter looks like a "stiff, buttoned-up executive" at first glance. While he can be "devious" like Faison, he's "not as deadly." Caralynn Lippo of "TV Fanatic" described Peter as "menacing-yet-conflicted." Donald Thompson said Henrik/Peter is "like a chameleon." Anders Hove described Peter as a "brilliant, good-looking young man who's been let down — and has certain genes from his father that are not worth bragging about." Shabnaj Chowdhury saw Peter "as a man haunted by his upbringing and desperate for redemption."
Backstory.
Peter, whose birth name is Henrik Faison, is the oldest son of Cesar Faison. According to Liesl Obrecht, Henrik idolizes his father but Faison doesn't show him any affection because of who his mother is, or isn't. Faison ships Henrik off to boarding school when he is old enough. In Peter's own words, Faison "rejected and hated" him. All Henrik knows of his mother growing up is that she abandoned him as an infant, and Henrik is delivered to Faison through a third party so not even Faison can determine which of his many lovers had given birth to his son. Henrik fantasizes about his mother coming to rescue him one day but Faison warns that it will never happen. Henrik finds relief that Faison usually ignores him to focus on business. Henrik attends several boarding schools in Europe, including one very prestigious school in Bern, Switzerland under the alias, Henri Francois. As a child, Henrik finds a friend and mentor in Valentin Cassadine, one of Faison's business associates. Valentin even attends one of Henrik's school plays after Faison refuses. After boarding school, Henrik comes to America to attend Harvard University. Henrik seemingly changes his name to Peter August just before his 21st birthday. As Peter, he attends graduate school at the Yale University's School of Management. After graduation, Peter finds work at several companies in Europe, including "Modesto Media" in Milan, Italy. However, he does not have much time for romantic relationships because he moves around too much. Peter successfully runs a publishing company for a couple of years in Europe before his arrival in Port Charles.
Henrik was born on June 13, 1976 with the help of midwife Mireille Lambert in a house located at 27 Rue De Louvain in Brussels, Belgium. Alex Marick seduces a drunken Faison to steal information from him. It was easy, as Faison had been paying prostitutes to impersonate Anna. Soon after, Alex suddenly leaves school for "special training" but in actuality, she was pregnant. Alex refuses to even look at her child and begs the midwife place the baby with a loving family. However, Valentin having followed Alex, tracks down Hernik's adoptive family, and threatens them into relinquishing the child whom he then turns over to Faison.
Peter craves "love and acceptance" but that desperation only makes life more difficult. With Faison as a father, "all he got was pain, abuse, manipulation and abandonment. He developed scars" Ramsey said. In 2019, Ramsey said the "trauma of being Faison's son" holds Peter back from having "a real life — real connections and real friendships and a real relationship" for most of his life. He grows up trying to "outrun" Faison's shadow. Before Anna, Peter does not have that "female energy to confide in or a mom to go and seek counsel from."
Introduction and identity (2017–2018).
Peter debut occurs during Sweeps in November 2017. On Peter's arrival, Ramsey described it as "very cloak-and-dagger and very manipulative." He also said Peter is "tugging on string and using words and intentions to make people dance the way he wants them to." For the first two months, Ramsey was "simply in the dark" about Peter's backstory. "Sometimes ignorance is bliss" Ramsey said. In December 2017, Ramsey met with Frank Valentini and script writer Elizabeth Korte to fill in the blanks about Peter. "It was a slow reveal but the moment I really needed what I needed, they gave it to me full force and I was able to run with it." In January 2018, Peter is revealed to be the traitorous son of Cesar Faison, born to Faison's arch nemesis, super spy Anna Devane. Ramsey described the plot twist as "overwhelming in a wonderful way" and he was "flattered" that the producers trusted him with such a pivotal role. Ramsey, who grew up watching Anna, was very excited about working with the Hughes. "I have a great scene partner in Wes" Hughes said of Ramsey."ABC Soaps In Depth" said "Perhaps the most tragic part of Peter’s tale is that the mother he hates for abandoning him only wants to find him, explain herself and take him into her arms." Ramsey said "an incredible and complicated backstory has been gifted to me." Shelly Altman explained that Peter and Anna are on a "collision course" because Peter resents the mother he never knew for abandoning him.
Peter takes center stage as Anna, Robert Scorpio, and Nina Cassadine are all prying into his past for different reasons. At the same time, Peter's confidant Valentin is on edge as he fears Peter's exposure. Meanwhile, mobster Jason Morgan and investigative journalist Lulu are also looking for Henrik. Peter is "at odds with some very powerful people, and they're getting close, but he's not fearful in anyway." Wes Ramsey was particularly excited about the potentially explosive reveal. "Things are about to get crazy" he declared. The revelation that Peter is Henrik "feels like a time bomb that's hardwired to branch out and devastate so many lives in so many different ways. When it goes off, it's going to spread like wildfire." Postponing the climax of the story "only has created more tension. Now, we're all horses at the gate, ready to run. We want the race to start!"
The storyline was set to climax during May Sweeps during the Nurses' Ball. By this time, more than half of the characters on canvas was invested in the plot in one way or another. It is not until Peter discovers that Anna has seemingly set a trap for him by "posing" as his mother that he views her as a real threat. Peter is insulted by the idea that Anna would use something so personal against him. "It is something that is he not going to let pass." Peter and Anna's first interactions before the reveal were "foreshadowing" of their eventual relationship. They "have an intellectual standoff, using their wits, minds and language to face off. Neither would back down, and that was powerful…" In their standoff, Peter is forced to confront the "anger and animosity" that he harbors for Anna.
Redemption (2018–2019).
In the summer of 2018, Peter undergoes the painstaking process of redemption which starts with delivering Maxie's baby under "dramatic" circumstances. Wes Ramsey described it as a "right of passage, to deliver a baby on the side of the road." Ramsey admitted that he did his best to support Kirsten Storms during the scenes because "as much was on my shoulders, there was even more on hers." While playing out the drama, the actors tried to find moments to insert a "light touch of humor" while also maintaining the realism.
Peter is simultaneously in both "the right place at the right time" for Maxie, or "the wrong place at the wrong time" because of what happens next. After he gets himself released from police custody Peter is abducted by Nathan's grief stricken mother, Liesl Obrecht. When Obrecht tricks Nina into helping her, Peter fears the worst. "He is quite sure that the endgame wasn't simply kidnapping him." Though Nina does want Peter to pay for his crimes, Nina has a big heart which Peter has to appeal to in order to garner sympathy. While Obrecht claims she only wants a confession, Peter quickly realizes she wants him dead. He must distract her with stories about his life in an effort to save himself. "If when his story is finished she intends to kill him, then Peter has to keep this story going for as long as possible!" He is even willing to give up the little bit of leverage he still has by telling Nina how Drew Cain can get his memories back. That's Peter's way of proving that he's not a "monster" and it works, at least for Nina. While Nina keeps Obrecht from going too far, she is too "torn" by her grief to simply help Peter escape. Despite his best efforts, Peter is terrified that he will die. But even when Obrecht is at her most cruel, Peter isn't easily defeated. According to Ramsey, "Peter's pulling on that same spirit and strength that allowed him to beat his father and survive all those years to become the man he is." When Peter convinces a young boy scout named Wyatt (Patrick Gibbons, Jr.) to free him, he uses that as motivation to convince Nina to let him go before someone else does. Obrecht nearly kills Peter, along with herself and Nina when she moves him to avoid being caught and they get caught in a fire. Fortunately he is rescued by Hamilton Finn. During Peter's "cruel" imprisonment and torture, Ramsey is able to "step away" from who Peter is on the surface, and explore the character. "It was certainly humbling to find the complete other side of the spectrum and show Peter’s vulnerability when he was facing his own mortality and his own remorse!" Ramsey said "Peter's certain paid a price for his actions" on the road to his redemption. However, Peter still must get out from under the WSB and earn Maxie's forgiveness but the actor insisted that "he'll figure something out!" When asked if Peter would cause more "havoc" on the canvas, Frank Valentini only said "there is a lot of story there" because of Peter's connections to those on and off canvas, including Anna and Maxie. In the aftermath of his ordeal with Obrecht, Ramsey insisted that Peter had paid sufficiently for his actions. "It was a bit of moral payback" Ramsey said. Peter goes from playing everyone around him to facing his "mortality and remorse." The actor said it was "humbling" experience to play the opposite of what Peter had previously presented himself to be. In addition to making amends to those he's wronged, part of Peter's redemption includes slowly building a relationship with Anna. While they start to thaw toward one another in time for the Christmas, "They're not like besties or anything" Finola Hughes said in early 2019. "They've begun this kind of dance" Hughes said of their evolving dynamic. It's like, "I won't be so prickly with you if you won't be so prickly with me." She continued, "It's a little push and pull." Despite what has happened to him, and what Peter says, "ABC Soaps In Depth" believes Peter "might not be as redeemed as he likes to think."
Relationship with Maxie.
In the meantime, Peter develops a friendship with Maxie Jones, his grieving widowed sister-in-law. Co-head writer Shelly Altman described the relationship as "mutually important" to both Peter and Maxie. While Maxie finds it easy to be around Peter because he isn't a constant reminder of the life she's lost, co-head writer Chris Van Etten explained that it's Peter's "guilt" over his role in his brother's death that draws Peter to Maxie. Peter feels a "responsibility" to take care for Maxie. While they are just friends, Peter knows "he's playing with fire." Peter's attraction to Maxie is "groundbreaking for him," according to Wes Ramsey. It is the first time Peter has ever "had someone in his life that he's wanted to protect." While it appeared to be "casual on the surface" the tragic circumstances that bring them together and the emotions in the aftermath of that tragedy "was such a strong bonding experience" for them. Caring about Maxie is the last thing Peter expected would happen. Peter feels like protecting Maxie and her unborn child can make amends for the pain he has caused. He will risk anything to protect whatever it is he has found with Maxie.
Through his relationship with Maxie, the writers explore how "deprived Peter felt throughout his entire life of having a connection in terms of family, a connection in terms of being able to be vulnerable." For Peter, "his connection to his nephew James is, in his heart, the only pure family that exists for him." Ramsey viewed Peter's "protective streak over Maxie" as "really honest." Kirsten Storms admits that Maxie gives Peter a pass for his schemes because of her own past and how often she's been forgiven. Storms could see why Maxie would be drawn to Peter, as Nathan's brother, even though they are very different. As he starts courting Maxie in 2019, Peter suddenly gets cold feet. According to Wes Ramsey, Peter "doesn't know what to do." Having grown up witnessing how Faison's obsession with Anna consumed his father, Peter is careful to make sure his feelings for Maxie are "true and genuine and coming from a healthy place." The best part for Peter is that he knows Maxie is willing to be as "impulsive" as he is for their first date. "She gets excited about his excitement." Though Maxie insist she does not need a "grand gesture," Peter wants to make it "perfect and special and magical." While they are not young lovers by any stretch of the imagination, "there were moments where I felt those butterflies, and some of those feelings that we remember from when we were younger, get to come out these moments with these two characters."
Storms was happy with Ramsey as her new scene partner. The actress appreciated that he could meet or at times exceed her expectations of preparedness in scene partner. "He cares about his work comes across and not in an arrogant way," Storms said of her co-star. Storms referenced one instance in which Peter reveals his true identity to Maxie. "For example, when he tells Maxie that he’s Henrik in the hospital and she is in a wheelchair, there were four or five other people in that scene who didn’t have dialogue, so there was chatting and laughing going on. He just completely zoned in to what he was doing."
Reception.
Casting and portrayal.
Michael Fairman described the announcement about Ramsey's hiring as "intriguing casting news." "TV Fanatic's" Caralynn Lippo and Stacy Miller from "The Nerdy Girl Express" were both fans of Ramsey from his role as Wyatt on the prime time supernatural drama "Charmed". Actress Finola Hughes didn't think the storyline would come to fruition even though she'd auditioned with several actors, until Ramsey was hired. Liz Masters from Soapcentral.com thought Wes Ramsey should have been a recast of Nathan West instead. However, by April 2018, Masters began to change her tune about the character. "Wes Ramsey is a handsome bugger, so it's getting harder and harder not to be pulled in by Peter's charm." Masters felt Peter was a "good guy" and felt keeping the character would be good for the canvas. Lippo said "I'm really into Wes Ramsey's addition to the cast so far." Lippo further praised Wes Ramsey for "successfully selling the idea that Peter truly isn't just a carbon copy of Faison." Miller said thanks to Ramsey's portrayal, "there's no black and white answer for Henrik's guilt or innocence, victim or villainy, only shades of gray. The character is constantly evolving, which makes Peter August a.k.a. Henrik Faison a fascinating study of nature vs. nurture." In June 2018, Shabnaj Chowdhury also praised Ramsey for his portrayal of the character and said "what makes this revelation — that Peter is actual Henrik, Anna’s long-lost son — really compelling is Wes Ramsey’s nuanced portrayal… Peter has emerged as a complex character worth noticing." Soapcentral.com's Tamilu said "I do like Peter August, though, and I hope Wes Ramsey sticks around." Alina Adams said it was "difficult" to decipher if Peter is a "good guy or a bad guy."
Introduction and redemption.
The revelation about Peter's identity garnered both positive and negative reactions from critics. Hope Campbell of "Soap Hub" was disappointed with the reveal that Peter was the one who betrayed Faison because she felt the traitor should have been an established veteran instead of a new character. "ABC Soaps In Depth" called the reveal "fantastically soapy." Janet Di Lauro described the "stunning" plot twist of Peter being Anna's son as the "shock of all shockers. Stacy Miller said "Henrik’s story is a classic example of a Shakespeare tragedy full of what ifs." In June 2018, "TV Insider" listed the revelation about Peter as one of the show's "8 Best Moments of 2018 So Far." In July 2018, "ABC Soaps In Depth" featured hailed the plot as the "Most Shocking Twist" of the year "So far." Donald Thompson of "Canyon News" was "absolutely floored" by the revelation that Anna is Henrik's mother. He also said "seeing Peter exude his dark will be fun to witness." Liz Masters felt the plot twist was "convoluted" and said "The idea that Anna gave birth to her homicidal stalker's baby makes me ill." Caralynn Lippo didn't like the idea of Anna being with Faison, but appreciated the "dramatic and major storyline" for Anna's portrayer, Finola Hughes. Finola Hughes did not see the plot twist as a "rewrite" specifically because she never agreed with the notion that Robert was Anna's "first," which was a point of contention for many viewers. However, Hughes thought it was "insane" when she found out about it. Meanwhile, "ABC Soaps In Depth" pointed out how Anna and Robert's romance started under less than honest circumstances, which includes hiding Robin from Robert.
Hope Campbell argued that Peter being Faison and Anna's son was "horrid enough" but "the character COULD have stayed contained." She continued, "we do not understand why this character was necessary, but since he's there, why oh why is he EVERYWHERE?" Tamilu of Soapcentral.com agreed with Campbell's complaints about the story's overexposure. While she liked the character and the story, it's "all Henrik all the time" and "I'm ready for the truth to come out." On the other hand, Caralynn Lippo liked how the story took centerstage and involved several different sets of characters. "ABC Soaps In Depth" agreed and appreciated the "umbrella" aspect of the story. The magazine liked that like that Peter was the "catalyst propelling other, more established characters into the spotlight, even as we get to know him a little bit better." Peter successfully orchestrating Faison's demise was "quite surprising" for Donald Thompson. "It was slightly overwhelming to say the least." Meanwhile, Faison's portrayer, Anders Hove was very interested to see what Peter would do next.
Caralynn Lippo was very excited about the impending revelation. "I'm actually really looking forward to the eventual Peter-is-Henrik reveal and the ramifications that will be seen all over the canvas." She said the "fall out" would make for "amazing soap." While some felt the story did not work, Donald Thompson felt the climax was one of the reasons the show was so interesting during May Sweeps. Thompson was also pleasantly surprised the writers didn't "drag out" the revelation about Peter's true identity and said the reveal made for an "awfully juicy" May Sweeps. Of all the aspects of the story, Liz Masters said the most interesting component was Peter's history with Valentin and she also looked forward to Peter and Anna's reunion. "Having a son around will do Anna a world of good, especially with Robin and the kids living on the other side of the country." of the reunion, Masters said it happened in "true dramatic fashion" and despite his failed attempt on Anna's life, "I'm really growing to like him." According to Masters, the confrontation scenes exceeded expectations. "The pain in Peter's expression as she revealed that Valentin had threatened his adoptive parents and given him to Faison, and the tears in his eyes when Anna announced that she refused to testify against her son, gutted me."
Tamilu from Soapcentral.com hoped Peter could be "redeemable." She said "Don't take [him] so far over the line that we can never love [him] again, because I really want to love [him]…" While Michael Fairman felt it provided great material for the actors involved, he felt Peter's abduction played onscreen for entirely too long. "ABC Soaps In Depth" agreed that while the plot provided great material for the actors, "it's also deprived the audience of a bigger payoff" due to the isolation from the canvas. Frank Valentini praised Ramsey's performance during the storyline. "I think he did a phenomenal job when Peter was kidnapped and tied-up. It’s not easy to be in scenes where you are tied-up for almost four weeks, and to act, and to stay present in the stage of being a hostage." Liz Masters applauded the writers for "misleading" the viewers with the "cliffhanger" of Nina finding Peter, when Obrecht was the real culprit. She also praised Ramsey for his "magnificent" portrayal "because the anguish Peter felt was palpable, right down to his shaking hands and quivering chin." She said the "scenes belong on an Emmy reel." Tamilu said while the storyline could be amusing at times, "it's time for the story to move along." She continued, "I am weary of Peter being chained up." Meanwhile, Liz Masters said the story "quickly faded from compelling" to "torture watching Peter's torture."
In December 2018, the storyline was featured on "TV Insider's" list of the "20 Craziest Daytime Soap Moments" of the year. "Soap Opera Digest" hailed the story as the "Biggest Rewrite" of the year and said it "required a greater suspension of disbelief than most." "ABC Soaps In Depth" ranked Peter's story at #6 on its list of the "10 Biggest Stories of 2018. The plot "not only brought back Anders Hove to the canvas, it added to the cast soap vet Wes Ramsey as Peter and gave Anna's portrayer some especially juicy material."
Romance.
In regards to Maxie falling for Peter only to learn of his treachery, Tamilu of Soapcentral.com said "Oh, the drama!" While "TV Fanatic's" Caralynn Lippo felt it was a soon for Maxie to enter into another romance in 2018, the writers are "laying great groundwork for a nice, slow-burn Maxie/Peter romance." Lippo said that while she enjoyed Peter's budding friendship with Maxie, she was "concerned" that it was being rushed. "Unfortunately, they've rapidly progressed from acquaintances to shirtless run-ins and sitting on a bed together while they're hotel neighbors." However, Lippo appreciated the "Soapy eye candy" and said Ramsey is "nice to look at." However, "It's a nice dynamic" she said. While she liked their "sweet" friendship, Liz Masters felt it was still too soon for a romance between Peter and Maxie. Despite agreeing with the general consensus that it was too soon, "ABC Soaps In Depth" said "we can't help seeing the possibilities" because of Wes Ramsey's "undeniable" chemistry with Kirsten Storms. The magazine praised the "natural ease" between Ramsey and Storms and said "the inherent drama is too good to pass up!" Tamilu worried Maxie might not forgive Peter for his betrayal and said it's "a damned shame, since I like the connection they have." She admitted that she was open to Maxie and Peter's eventual romance "because I am in incurable romantic, and I love redemption stories." By September 2018, Tamilu was a bit exhausted by the waiting game. She said "I wish we had one writer who wanted to actually write a couple together." Tamilu found "genuine delight" in their budding romance. While she grew to like the pairing, Liz Masters admitted she wasn't ready for Maxie to move on. Masters felt it was "easier" to accept Maxie moving on because she was the one pursuing Peter. Soapcentral.com listed Peter and Maxie's relationship as one of the best parts of General Hospital in 2018. In January 2019, Tamilu agreed that it was the right time for Maxie to move on with Peter. "I really love her and Peter together." Even with the return of Maxie former lover, Spinelli, Tamilu still rooted for Peter and Maxie. In May 2019, Liz Masters said she felt Maxie needed a bit of a push to solidify her relationship with Peter. "Maxie is the type of person who has a better appreciation for things that she has to work for, and I don't feel as if Maxie has worked all that hard for Peter." Meanwhile, Tamilu was annoyed with the "stall tactics" that plagued Maxie and Peter's first date and felt the writers should stop dragging the story out. "ABC Soaps In Depth" said that while the pairing was obvious, but praised the writers for "wisely" not rushing Peter and Maxie into a romance. The magazine felt that Peter "massive amount of baggage" and Maxie's "checkered past" made the two "downright perfect for one another."
Majority of viewers were initially against the pairing. A May 2018 fan poll revealed that 81% of "ABC Soaps In Depth" readers felt it was too soon for Maxie to move on with Peter. However, by 2019 many viewers had come around to the idea of a Maxie/Peter pairing. Majority of "Soap Hub" readers (57% of 11,000) loved Maxie and Peter's chemistry and were excited about the dramatic potential should they come together. In November 2018, Peter and Maxie made their debut at #8 on "ABC Soaps In Depth's" "Top 10 Couples" poll. That same month, the magazine asked readers if they preferred Maxie be paired with Peter or Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell) and Peter won the fan vote with 54%. In January 2019, Maxie and Peter ranked at #4 in the overall couples poll and the third most popular pairing in the series amongst "ABC Soaps In Depth" readers. "ABC Soaps In Depth" said "Slow and steady seems to be not only the way to win the race, but to convince a reluctant audience" that Peter is worthy of Maxie. 75% of their readers felt Maxie and Peter were meant to be. One reader, Michelle Jenkins was all for the pairing and said Maxie "makes [Peter] want to be a better person." Blane Puglies liked the idea of Maxie and Peter, but was worried he would take advantage for her feelings for him, similar to Valentin's dynamic with Nina. Linda Morgan Johnson preferred the two as just friends, while Maureen Bartek refused to accept the pairing. Sharon Magnan felt Peter worked better as a villain instead of a reformed good guy. "As a good guy, he's bland and boring. Maxie needs much more than that."
Fan reaction.
Like critics, the reactions from fans was mixed. Aurora Suarez described the plot a "travesty" and a "slap in the face" to those who watched Anna from the beginning. Theresa K. Wicoff said it was "terrible attempt to shock the audience." Meanwhile, Rhonda Robertson said "I actually think the story works the way they told it" felt it would making for "interesting" story. Linda LeColst also liked the plot. "ABC Soaps In Depth" ran a poll in which 79% of readers felt Peter had paid enough for his actions after the abduction and torture. Nancy Dash loved the kidnapping said Peter "deserves worse if you ask me." Tammy McKinney said "What would GH be without a good kidnapping?" Meanwhile, Patricia Wade didn't like the story at all. "The torturing of Peter is more like the movie "Misery" and if I wanted to watch violence, I can watch nighttime TV or a movie!" Hope Campbell went so far as to blame Peter's origin story, couple with other stories when the series fell to last place in the ratings in May 2018. She continued, "Despite fan backlash, despite falling ratings, there’s Peter." "ABC Soaps In Depth" also took note of the ratings decline during the story's climax and how many fans voiced their displeasure on social media about Peter monopolizing the canvas. "I'm not going to be shy about it. My Twitter feed is not happy," Hughes said during an interview with the publication. The magazine noted that the show did acknowledge the viewer criticism by having Robert talk Anna out blaming herself for Peter's actions in story. "Soap Opera Digest" said "By underestimating its fans' tolerance for tampering with Anna's canon, GH delivered a tale that got them talking for all the wrong reasons." "Michael Fairman TV" called Peter the "Most Polarizing Character" of the year. "We have never seen such different views from the audience for one character. Many loathe the character of Peter August and want him off the canvas, others like the portrayal by Ramsey, and throughout 2018 as the character had plenty of screen-time. Fans were one way, or the other, on this one." Despite a rough first year, in May 2019, Ramsey made his debut on "ABC Soaps In Depth"s "Top 5 Actors" poll when he was voted in by readers, landing at number five.

Sharon Calahan

Sharon Calahan is an American cinematographer who was director of photography on the Pixar films "A Bug's Life" (1998), "Toy Story 2" (1999), and "Finding Nemo" (2003), and was lighting director for "Ratatouille" (2007), "Cars 2" (2011), and "The Good Dinosaur" (2015). She took part in the early rise of computer animated feature filmmaking and the acceptance of that medium as cinematography. Calahan is the first member of the American Society of Cinematographers who was invited to join on the basis of a career entirely in animated film. She was nominated, with Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Rick Sayre, for a 2000 BAFTA Award for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects for "A Bug's Life".
Early life and education.
Calahan is a graduate of Othello High School, in Othello, Washington, and of the art program at Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC). Her studies did not include filmmaking, computer animation or computer science, but rather illustration, graphic design, and still photography. She "stumbled into computer animation by accident", eventually leading to her career in feature film cinematography.
Lighting and cinematography.
Calahan worked in Spokane as an art director at KXLY-TV, KREM (TV), and at documentary film company Pinnacle Productions. Calahan was part of the early years of the computer-generated imagery (CGI) industry's expansion into television and feature films, as lighting director making commercials and TV programs for Pacific Data Images (later PDI/DreamWorks), until she joined Pixar in 1994, first as a lighting supervisor on "Toy Story" (1995).
The first time Pixar used the title "Director of Photography" (DP) on a film was on Calahan's next project, "A Bug's Life", representing a recognition that the processes and thinking behind computer generated film production had more in common with live action film than with cel animation. At Pixar it became an established goal to make films that looked like live action, not cartoons. More than a dozen years later, computer animated films at other studios, such as "How to Train Your Dragon" (DreamWorks, 2010) and "Frozen" (Disney, 2013) still did not credit a director of photography.
Calahan said that on any kind of production, whether entirely made of computer-generated imagery, or a typical modern feature that is usually a hybrid of live action shots with large amounts of added CGI, or a pre-computer era movies shot entirely on film, the director of photography "sets the visual tone" and will "create and realize an artistic vision for the composition, lighting and look of the movie as a whole," meaning that there is little real difference between a traditional "director of photography" credit and the new labels that were tested during CGI's infancy, "virtual cinematographer", "director of imaging", or "computer graphics director of photography". In a Pixar production, a team of about 30 to 65 lighting artists is overseen by the DP, whose lighting director guides master lighters, who both pre-light each scene and oversee shot lighters who light each shot individually. This takes place in constant collaboration with the layout department, and with teams doing concept art, storyboarding, and previsualization. During pre-production, while sets and characters are being designed by the art department and the technical teams are designing workflows, lighting has not yet begun, but Calahan will paint several hundred lighting concept illustrations, based on the other teams' work but also influencing them as her paintings evolve alongside their design work. During this iterative and mutually collaborative process, Calahan will begin to settle on lighting for each scene and will ask other teams for changes, like recomposing shots.
Calahan's work as both visual designer and lighting director of "The Good Dinosaur" was based in her experience as a native of the Pacific Northwest and from her time spent painting landscapes around the area of Jackson, Wyoming, which became Calahan's model for the film's setting. Calahan had often vacationed in the mountains to do landscape painting. During location scouting in the Jackson area, as well as in Yellowstone National Park, including a white water rafting trip, digital photos were collected, and added to Calahan's own library of photos of the region. By the time director Peter Sohn and director of photography-camera Mahyar Abousaeedi had sets and rough character animation to work with, they could establish factors such as blocking, camera lens focal lengths, and depth of field. This allowed Calahan and her team of close to 40 lighters to do a first lighting pass, setting the initial tone for the rest of the production, and giving the film its unique look. For "The Good Dinosaur", this meant open and natural landscapes with a rugged, pioneering feel, while for "Ratataoullie" the lighting was soft and romantic, and "Cars 2", a "guy's film", was all about shiny metal.
In 2007, Calahan was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). She became a member of the American Society of Cinematographers in 2014, as the first member to be elected to that professional group who had worked only in animation, without also having done live action film.

Moral enhancement

Moral enhancement (abbreviated ME), also called moral bioenhancement (abbreviated MBE), is the use of biomedical technology to morally improve individuals. MBE is a growing topic in neuroethics, a field developing the ethics of neuroscience as well as the neuroscience of ethics. After Thomas Douglas introduced the concept in 2008, its merits have been widely debated in academic bioethics literature. Since then, Ingmar Persson and Julian Savulescu have been the most vocal MBE supporters. Much of the debate over MBE has focused on their 2012 book in support of it, "Unfit for the Future? The Need for Moral Enhancement."
Different kinds of moral enhancement.
Moral enhancement in general is sometimes distinguished from MBE specifically, such that ME includes any means of moral improvement while MBE only involves biomedical interventions. Some also distinguish invasive from non-invasive, intended from resultant, treatment-focused from enhancement-focused, capability-improving from behavior-improving, and passive from active ME interventions. Vojin Rakić has distinguished involuntary (i.e. targeting unborn) from compulsory and voluntary MBE, claiming that compulsory MBE is not justifiable and proposing that "a combination of [voluntary MBE] and [involuntary MBE] might be the best option humans have to become better".
Arguments in favour.
Douglas originally suggested MBE as a counter-example to what he calls the "bioconservative thesis," which claims that human enhancement is immoral even if it is feasible. He argues that enhancements to improve someone’s moral motivations would at least be morally permissible. For example, he cites enhancements to reduce "counter-moral" racist and aggressive emotional reactions as morally permissible because they remove impediments to morality.
In 2009, Mark Alan Walker proposed a "Genetic Virtue Project" (GVP) to genetically enhance moral traits. Given that personality traits are heritable, and some traits are moral while others are immoral, he suggests increasing moral traits while reducing immoral ones through genetic engineering.
Companions in innocence.
Walker argues for the GVP based on what he calls a ‘‘companions in innocence’’ strategy, which says that “any objection raised against the GVP has an analogue in socialization and educational efforts. Since such objections are not understood as decisive against nurturing attempts, they should not be considered decisive against the GVP.” In other words, any objection to MBE which also applies to traditional moral education has reduced itself to absurdity, because few would argue that teaching someone to be moral is inherently objectionable. 
Several other MBE proponents have cited moral education as an example of socially accepted non-biomedical moral enhancement. For example, Douglas calls it “intuitively clear” that any given person has a reason to undergo moral self-enhancement by reducing counter-moral emotions through self-reflection. Douglas says that at least some of the intuitive reasons that anyone should become morally better through self-reflection, like increasing concern for others or good consequences, apply to voluntary MBE.
Unfit for the Future.
Based on the fact that human technological progress has advanced faster than human moral psychology can adapt through evolution, Persson and Savulescu point out that humans' capability to cause large-scale destruction has increased exponentially. However, given that humans tend to care only about their immediate acquaintances and circumstances instead of thinking on a larger scale, they are vulnerable to tragedies of the commons like climate change and to technologies like nuclear weapons which pose an existential threat to humanity.
Given that moral education and liberal democracy are insufficient, MBE is needed at least as a supplementary method to solve these problems. Persson and Savulescu's argument relies on the notion that it is much easier to cause great harm than it is to cause goodness to an equal extent. Because of the human population size there will inevitably be a fraction of humanity which is immoral enough to desire to inflict this great harm. Persson and Savulescu conclude that the intervention of extensive human moral enhancement is a necessary component to address this threat.
Criticism.
Central issues debated in literature about MBE include whether there is an urgent need for it, if a sufficient consensus on the definition of morality is achievable, technically feasible and ethically permissible interventions to carry out MBE, the ability to ensure no violation of consent in those interventions, and the ability to ensure no harmful social side-effects that they produce.
The Freedom to Fall.
John Harris criticised moral enhancement on the grounds of 'The Freedom to Fall'. His principal argument is that moral enhancement is wrong because it restricts one's freedom to do wrong, making it impossible to act immorally, thus undermining their autonomy. Harris referred to Book III of Milton's Paradise Lost, in which Milton reported God saying, 'Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.' Harris believed that one should hang on to their freedom to fall. Without it, one is unable to discern right from wrong, taking away both freedom and virtue. Harris asserted that there is no virtue involved in performing activities that one is instructed to.
There are two further criticisms of moral enhancement. First, the distinction between right and wrong is highly context-dependent. For example, in the case of self-defense, harming another person can potentially be morally justifiable, as it might be the best compromise of welfare. Harris suggested that it is unclear whether MBE would be nuanced enough to take such situations into account. Second, he pointed out that there is an element of value judgement when one makes a choice between 'right' and 'wrong', and he said that people are entitled to willingly make the wrong choices. This would not be possible with MBE, which compromises this 'freedom to fall.'
Harris advocates science, innovation and knowledge — particularly in the form of education — as possible solutions to the possibility of mass destruction. Again, he refers to Milton, in particular the power of freedom and sense of justice installed within subjective selves. Most importantly, the roles of freedom and autonomy entails that one cannot have the sufficiency to stand without the freedom to fall.
Replies.
Harris's "Freedom to Fall" has been widely criticized by MBE proponents, who have argued that MBE is benign to freedom and can sometimes increase freedom. Freely chosen moral enhancement is no threat to freedom, as described by Vojin Rakić. By reducing biases that impair moral judgement, Thomas Douglas argues, MBE can remove constraints on the ability to be moral. This does not take away anyone's freedom to be immoral. Instead, it simply grants them more freedom to be moral. Similarly, Persson and Savulescu point out that increasing someone's motivation to act rightly for the right reasons makes them no less free than "the garden-variety virtuous person" who already has that motivation.
Several MBE proponents have pointed out that Harris's "Freedom to Fall" assumes the controversial view that if someone's actions are fully determined by previous causes, then that person cannot act freely. If anyone can be free to act one way when they will certainly act another way, then MBE can cause moral improvement without taking away any valuable freedom. Most philosophers believe that free will is compatible with determinism in this way. If they are right, then MBE can improve moral behavior without affecting anyone's freedom.
Sufficiency of non-biomedical methods.
Terri Murray disputes the claim by Persson and Savulescu that political will and moral education are insufficient to ensure that people will behave responsibly, claiming that Persson and Savulescu unjustly reify moral dispositions in biology. Murray argues that political and social pressure are sufficient to improve behavior, explaining that although certain Islamic countries state that women should be forced to wear the burka and stay indoors because men cannot control their sexual urges, this is shown to be false by men in Western countries, both Muslim or otherwise, exercising their ability to control their sexual urges. She explained that this is due to the deterrent effect of both laws and social pressure:
Ethical basis of moral enhancement.
Since the nature of morality has historically caused wide disagreements, several authors have questioned whether it is possible to come up with a sufficiently widely accepted ethical basis for MBE, especially with respect to what qualities should be enhanced. Joao Fabiano argues that attempting to produce a full account of morality in order to enable moral enhancement would be "both impractical and arguably risky". Fabiano also suggests that "we seem to be far away from such an account" and notes that 'the inability for prior large-cooperation" plays a role in this.
Although there are a wide variety of disagreeing ethical systems, David DeGrazia argues, there are “points of overlapping consensus among competing, reasonable moral perspectives.” Traditional moral education generally teaches children to stay within that consensus. DeGrazia’s idea of this overlapping consensus includes disapproval of antisocial personality disorder, sadism, some kinds of moral cynicism, defective empathy, out-group prejudice, inability to face unpleasant realities, weak will, impulsivity, lack of nuance in moral understanding, and inability to compromise. Biomedically reducing these traits would, per DeGrazia’s reasoning, count as moral enhancement from these “reasonable moral perspectives.”
Other issues.
MBE proponents have been accused of being too speculative, overstating the capabilities of future interventions and describing unrealistic scenarios like enhancing "all of humanity." One literature review assesses the evidence on seven interventions cited by MBE proponents, saying that none works well enough to be practically feasible.
Furthermore, there is some doubt that any drugs for moral enhancement will soon be introduced to the market. Nick Bostrom highlighted that the way medical research is conducted and drugs approved impedes the development of enhancement drugs. A drug must demonstrably treat a specific disease to be approved, Bostrom said, but the traits or behaviors targeted for MBE arguably cannot be viewed as diseases. Bostrom concludes that any drug that has an enhancing effect "in healthy subjects is a serendipitous unintended benefit". He suggests that the current "disease-focused medical model" needs to be changed, otherwise enhancement drugs could not be researched well and introduced to the market. Along with this feasibility objection, he notes that public funding for enhancement drugs research projects is currently very limited.
Other authors have suggested that unless MBE is based on an individual's choice, it cannot truly be called "moral" enhancement because personal choice is the basis of ethics. Murray argues that the idea that biological enhancement can make us morally good "undermines our understanding of moral goodness." She argues that MBE allows for "paternalistic interventions" from medical experts to "redirect the individual's behaviour to conform to their or society's 'best interests."
Ram-Tiktin suggests that if MBE is more effective for enhancing people that are already moral, then it could further the gap between moral and immoral people, exacerbating social inequality. Also, if MBE makes some people morally better, it could unfairly raise the moral standards for everyone else.
Incompetent, cruel, and immoral interventions of a medical nature intended to impose morality and pacify prisoners throughout the Western World from the time of the lobotomy. One area of intense criticism and public objection is the use of estrogen to pacify male child prisoners of the California prison system.

Grace Helen Mowat

Grace Helen Mowat (January 31, 1875 – February 22, 1964) was a Canadian artist and writer living in New Brunswick.
Early life and education.
The daughter of George Mowat and Isabella Campbell, Mowat was born on the Beech Hill family farm near St. Andrews, New Brunswick. The Mowat family was of United Empire Loyalist descent. In her childhood, Mowat spent a lot of time surrounded by her older relatives. There she developed an interest in narrative from reading old archived letters written by both sides of her family.
She was educated at Charlotte County Grammar School and went on to study at Richmond School of Art and Music in London and the Women's Art School at Cooper Union in New York City.
Career.
Writer.
Mowat wrote lighthearted accounts of local history such as "Funny Fables of Fundy" (1928), and "the Diverting History of a Loyalist Town" (1932). In the 1920s–30s, Mowat diverted her talents towards the local theatre as a playwright. "The Perfect Actor", and "the Unguarded Boarder", were among exceedingly popular attractions in the summer, and garnered the attention of many visitors.
Teacher.
She started her teaching career at St. Catherine's Hall in Augusta, Maine. From there, she taught art classes at the Halifax Ladies College from 1902 to 1906. In 1907, she suffered a nervous breakdown and returned home to St. Andrews.
Art Director.
In 1914, Mowat founded Charlotte County Cottage Craft, which provided an outlet for locally produced traditional crafts including pottery and weaving, and she served as its director until 1945. With her help, New Brunswick crafts were exhibited at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition in Wembley, London, England. She also founded the St. Andrews Music, Art, and Drama Society in 1934. Mowat wrote plays such as "The Perfect Actor" and "The Unguarded Border".
Later life.
Honours.
The University of New Brunswick awarded Mowat an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1951.
Death.
She died in St. Andrews at the age of 89, and was buried under the headstone "Founder of Charlotte County Cottage Craft" in a rural family plot.

Harriet Mary Ford

Harriet Mary Ford or simply Harriet Ford (1859- 31 October 1938) was a Canadian artist who worked as a painter, muralist and jeweller. She has been described as epitomizing "the Canadian New Woman". Ford was active as a critic, writer, and lecturer, and was known in academic circles as an authority on Renaissance art and artists. Ford belonged to a number of societies and organizations and founded the Society of Mural Decorators in 1894. 
Early life.
Ford was born in Brockville, Ontario, Canada in 1859. Her father was a barrister, David B. Ogden Ford. After being orphaned at the age of ten, Ford was educated at a private Anglican school for girls, the Bishop Strachan School, from 1870 to 1878.
Education and travels.
Ford studied at the Central Ontario School of Art in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the St John's Wood Art School, and the Royal Academy in London, England. In France, she studied at the Académie Colarossi in Paris and with Luc-Olivier Merson and Joseph Blanc. Ford also completed a residence in Italy as part of her training, before focusing on her work as a muralist, painter and jewellery maker.
Ford spent much of her life traveling, visiting countries such as Italy, Spain and England, and living intermittently in Canada and England. During her time spent in England, Ford shared a cottage with her fellow artists Edith Hayes and Sydney Strickland Tully in Newlyn and Bovingdon Green, Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire. Although she frequented Newlyn and many other parts of England, Ford preferred passing her time in St. Ives. Ford began to express new ideas and attitudes towards art after her many travels throughout Europe, thus prompting critics to brand her as "dangerous."
Ford worked full-time as a writer, lecturer and artist. She was unmarried, professionally focused and financially independent, and has been described as epitomizing "the Canadian New Woman". Such a position had both benefits and drawbacks. After winning the 1896 poster competition for the Toronto Horse Show, Ford was attacked by an anonymous critic in "Saturday Night" magazine, who derided both the poster's design of a woman on a horse and the very idea of the "New Woman".
With her international experience, Ford was a supporter of the idea that Canadian artists should be free to find inspiration wherever they wished. In J. Russell Harper's "Painting in Canada: A History", Ford stated that she did not believe that the depiction of Canadian scenes was essential for the participation in the Canadian school of art.
Career as an artist.
Painter.
Ford’s work is in such public collections as the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Art Gallery of Hamilton.
In painting, Ford worked primarily in oil paint, watercolour, and pastel. 
She displayed her work at numerous locations including the Royal Canadian Academy and the Paris Salon. During the Royal Canadian Academy Exhibition of 1895, Ford displayed four of her own pieces, including "Girl in White", "Annunciation", a decorative oil panel and a self-portrait.
In 1896, Ford won a competition for the design of a horse show poster, beating out several notable Montreal artists. The work, printed in red, yellow, blue, and black, was later shown in an art exhibition in Montreal, where it reportedly was criticized for its break from formalist traditions. However, many of these criticisms acknowledged how Ford intentionally disregarded these conventions about colour and perspective, and that it was not due to a lack of skill or formal training. The poster was also mailed out to members of the artistic community for their personal collections.
While living abroad, Ford also made sketches of the various locations she saw on her travels. She sent these sketches back to Canada, and one was included in an issue of "Canadian Magazine" in 1896.
Muralist.
Ford's work in house decoration included furniture, screens, and murals, but few examples of this work remain. Ford was interested in murals as early as 1895, when she spoke about the subject during a lecture in Toronto. Ford was one of the few female Canadian artists at the time to receive commercial commissions to create murals. She was commissioned to create murals in the private homes of wealthy patrons such as Charles Porteous, James Mavor and in public institutions such as Saint John's Convalescent Hospital in Toronto, where she was commissioned to create her mural "Mother and Child." She was a member of the Canadian Mural Decorator's Society, and in 1898 collaborated on an unsuccessful project to decorate Toronto's Union Station with a mural of Canadian railway builders at work.
Jeweller.
Between 1908 and 1912, Ford began to work as a jewellery designer and metal smith. Ford likely received instruction on jewellery making from the Arts and Crafts Movement during her time spent in England. Ford began working with silver, but eventually progressed towards incorporating gold within her pieces. Like many jewellery makers associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, Ford integrated semi-precious stones, such as cabochons, turquoise, mother of pearl, baroque pearls, and river pearls. Her work was featured in a 2001 exhibition at the Art Gallery of Hamilton. Some of her jewellery was included in the exhibition "Artists, Architects &amp; Artisans: Canadian Art 1890-1918" at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario in 2013.
Social and academic presence.
In the late 1890s, Ford delivered several lectures based on her studies in Italy. These lectures were well-attended, necessitating on one occasion the relocation to a larger room in order to seat all those attending. Ford’s lectures were based on her studies of early Renaissance art and artists, a subject on which she was considered an authority. Ford delivered her first lecture on Giotto and his followers at the Ontario Society of Artists on March 19, 1895. During this lecture, Ford was described as a "competent lecturer" who engaged the audience with interesting discussions. Ford referred to other academics in her lectures, including art historian John Ruskin, but also discussed her own research.
Ford also discussed the state of Canadian art in publications, such as J. Russell Harper’s "Painting in Canada: A History". Within this publication, Ford stated that she did not believe the depiction of Canadian scenes was essential for the creation of or participation in the Canadian school of art.
Together with George Agnew Reid and Carl Ahrens, Ford founded "Tarot" magazine in 1896 and acted as an editor for this magazine dedicated to the Arts and Crafts Movement.
Affiliations.
Ford belonged to many societies and academies, including the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, the Palette Club, the Ontario Society of Artists, the Women’s International Art Club. Ford was a founder of the Society of Mural Decorators in 1894.
Death and legacy.
Ford died in Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England on October 10, 1938. Many of her works are in the National Gallery of Canada, The Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Art Gallery of Hamilton.

LGBT youth vulnerability

LGBT youth vulnerability is the increased social vulnerability that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth face compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. Due to this increased vulnerability, there are notable differences in the mental and physical health risks tied to the social interactions of LGBT youth compared to the social interactions of heterosexual youth. Youth of the LGBT community experience greater encounters with not only health risks, but also violence, due to their sexual orientation, self-identification, and lack of support from institutions in society.
Health studies.
LGBT youth face a variety of stressors that affect their mental health. Due to society’s tendency to discriminate against non-heterosexual sexual orientations and identities, members of the LGBT community are 3 times more likely to face mental health disorders. For instance, the constant fear of not being accepted after coming out to one’s community can lead to an anxiety disorder, depression, PTSD, suicidal thoughts, or substance abuse. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) LGBT teens, in particular, “are 6 times more likely to experience symptoms of depression” than their heterosexual peers as they are just beginning to navigate how to come out to friends, family, and other associates, while still developing into an adult.
Because of the crucial development stages youth experience before adolescence, it is more likely for mental disorder to be expressed if a stressor is presented. It was reported in 2012 that within the year, 10% of youth in America demonstrated a mood disorder, 25% presentes an anxiety disorder, and 8.3% presented a substance use disorder. Also, the third leading cause of death for the 10-14 age group is suicide and the second leading cause for those 15-24. Out of these statistics, youth of the LGBT community are three times more likely to experience and report suicidality.
Some studies that have been conducted are not completely inclusive of the entire LGBT community because of its rapid growth and expansion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a 2015 Youth Risk and Behavior Survey (YRBS) ,that surveyed approximately 1,285,000 LGB youth out of 16,067,000 students total in grades 9-12 nationwide and was able to provide evidence of greater physical and mental vulnerabilities among the youth of the LGBT community.
The survey found that 10% of LGB students were threatened with a weapon on school property, 34% were bullied at school, 28% of LGB students were bullied electronically and 18% experienced physical dating violence. Another 18% of LGB students had been forced to have sexual intercourse at some point. These results were successful in pointing out these vulnerabilities of LGB students, however, about 514,000 students included in the survey were not sure of their “sexual identity.” According to the CDC, there are a couple of things the school can do that are evidence and research based to help the school become a healthy place for all children, and those ways are: encourage respect for all children, no matter what their ethnicity is or sexual orientation and ban bullying, harassment, or violence. Then identify "safe places" on campus for the students like a counselor's office or a designated classroom where students of the LGBTQ community can find support and feel safe, and ensure the health curriculum and sex education is up to date regarding the LGBTQ community and have HIV, STD, and pregnancy prevention information that is relevant to them.
Another survey conducted by the Human Rights Campaign titled, “Growing Up LGBT in America,” acknowledges the vulnerabilities faced by about 10,000 LGBT youth from the age of 13 to 17. This survey found that 4 out of 10 youth felt that their neighborhoods weren’t accepting of the LGBT community. On top of this 73% of youth surveyed admitted to being more honest about their identity online and 26% identified their largest “problems” as being related to being out and accepted at home and/or school. The contrast this survey makes to 22% of non LGBT youth who identified their largest “problems” as relating to academics displays the different mindsets that are present in the two groups, thus representing the different mental effects LGBT youth experience.
Media.
Online platforms have become a way to communicate common, and uncommon, standpoints globally. Hashtags and campaigns are present methods of spreading the word about public issues and topics. As the LGBT community uses online platforms to interact with society and run campaigns that advocate for the community, it embraces vulnerability in order to overcome it.
National Coming Out Day takes place on October 11 and is a day for LGBT individuals to willingly disclose their sexual orientation or identity. This can take place in many ways that include, but are not limited, to social media announcements and coming out to close family members. Because of current technology platforms that allow for social networking, much of National Coming Out Day can be observed on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube. The Human Rights Campaign has conducted a survey tracking the impact of National Coming Out Day nationwide. 91% of LGBT youth who participated in the survey came out to close friends and reported more overall happiness as they continued to live in their communities and interact with friends, family, and classmates.
Another holiday that was created to celebrate The LGBTQ community and is celebrated in the month of October is called, LGBT History Month and it was originally created in October 1994 by Rodney Wilson and he was the first openly gay teacher in Missouri. In 2009, our current president at the time, Barack Obama officially made it a National History Month and that whole month is dedicated to learning about their rights, expressing openness, and celebrating the LGBTQ community together. In 2020, there are many places besides the United States that learn and celebrate it all month long like, The United Kingdom, Hungary, United States, Brazil, Canada, Greenland, the city of Berlin, and Australia; and in 2012 two schools in the United States celebrated LGBT History Month. 
A similar initiative taken online in the LGBT community is International Transgender Day of Visibility. This day takes place on March 31 and recognizes transgender individuals in an effort to empower those who identify as transgender in the LGBT community. Rachel Crandell founded this day in 2009 and it has since fought against “cissexism” and “transphobia.” [3] Initiatives like National Coming Out Day and the International Transgender Day of Visibility are public reminders of the potential social media holds in educating the masses and raising awareness of the LGBT community.

The home was Listed on 5 December 1984 (English Heritage Legacy ID: 432086). The document indicates that the house "possibly incorporating part of a late C16 or C17 house" was extensively modified in the subsequent years, and was "thought to be the setting for 'Pride and Prejudice'. (Mr. Mattingley, unpublished work on Gennings)". That assumption is not supported by other sources, however.
Occupants.
In the mid to late 1700s, the House was purchased by Sir Walter Roberts, 6th Bt. His only child, Jane Roberts, inherited the house upon his death. Jane Roberts married George Beauclerk, 3rd Duke of St Albans (a great-grandson of Charles II of England). The 3rd Duke and Duchess of St Albans had no children, and the Duchess died in 1778.
In 1871 the Liberal politician Henry Campbell-Bannerman inherited the estate from his uncle, Henry Bannerman, and the Campbell-Bannermans kept the house as their country residence until 1887. (In fact, Campbell-Bannerman inherited the entire estate of Hunton Court Lodge but did not occupy the mansion until the 1894 death of the aunt who was living there. He and his wife used Gennings Park during some of that time.) 
Upon his death, his nephew, James Campbell-Bannerman inherited the estate in 1908. 
Following the Campbell-Bannermans' departure in 1887, the house was lived in by John Bazley White, who lived in the house until at least 1893. In 1895 the occupants of the house were Conservative MP and distiller, Sir Frederick Seager Hunt, 1st Bt and his wife. 
The house was purchased in 1909 by Ellen Stager, wife of Arthur Butler, 4th Marquess of Ormonde, who at the time were known as Lord and Lady Arthur Butler. Lord Arthur was the younger brother and heir to James Butler, 3rd Marquess of Ormonde and Lady Arthur, daughter of General Anson Stager was an American heiress who had an inheritance of $1,000,000. They continued to live at Gennings after Lord Arthur inherited the title Marquess of Ormonde. Lord Ormonde died in 1943 and Lady Ormonde lived at Gennings with her son, Lord Arthur (who would later become Arthur Butler, 6th Marquess of Ormonde in 1949), his wife Jesse and their daughter, Lady Martha, until her death in 1951.
In 1955 their second son Arthur Butler, 6th Marquess of Ormonde sold Gennings and much of its contents.

European Flavour Association

European Flavour Association (EFFA) is a non-profit European-level trade association of the flavor industry, based in Brussels, Belgium. Founded in 1961, the organisation originally focused on both flavours and fragrances, but has focused solely on flavours since 2006. Its members include 12 national (covering approximately 300 SME's) and 10 direct member companies.
Purpose.
EFFA helps to promote and coordinate Europe's flavour industry, which accounts for approximately one-third of the global market and includes more than 300 businesses employing 10,000 skilled workers. In addition, EFFA helps to coordinate regulatory positions within the industry and information about flavourings for the general public.
EFFA welcomed the European Commission (EC) Regulation on Flavourings and has published a Guidance Document on the EC Regulation on Flavourings that is available at its public website: http://effa.eu/library/guidance-documents
History.
The association was founded in 1961. It was originally called the "Bureau de Liaison des Syndicats Européens des Produits Aromatiques". Thirty years later, this name was officially changed to the European Flavour and Fragrance Association (EFFA). EFFA is based in Brussels, Belgium.
In 2009, changes in how the flavour and fragrance industries were regulated led to EFFA to divide into two organisations. After that date, EFFA focused solely on the flavour industry, while the International Fragrance Organisation - Europe (IFRA) assumed responsibility for the fragrance industry in Europe.
On 20 June 2017, EFFA hosted the "FlavourDay" in Brussels to bring together food and flavouring industry experts. Additional FlavourDays were held later that year in Copenhagen, London and Paris, and continues in 2018, starting with Istanbul. The FlavourDay campaign was shortlisted by the 2018 "Transform" Awards for "Best implementation of a brand development project across multiple markets" and by the 2018 European Association Awards for "Best Association Networking Event".
Members.
EFFA's members include the national flavour associations of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK.
Company members include Firmenich, Givaudan, Mane, Robertet, International Flavors and Fragrances, Symrise, Takasago, Kerry Group, and Sensient Flavors. In January 2018, McCormick &amp; Company joined as an EFFA full member.
EFFA is itself a member of the International Organization of the Flavor Industry (IOFI).

Brujas (skate crew)

Brujas (English: witches) is an American all-female skate collective based in the Bronx, New York. The name derived from a 1986 video called "Skate Witches."
Brujas was founded by Arianna Gil and other skaters in 2014 to host meeting places for female skaters of color who felt excluded by men. Since then, the group has become involved with community organizing and political activism.
About the name Brujas, Gil mentioned, "We are intersectional feminists who are interested in spirituality and the tradition of "brujería" (witchcraft) in our culture. So there was more going on than just that little YouTube video."
Activism.
In 2016 Brujas created Brujas x 1971, a limited edition streetwear line that was funded through Kickstarter. The 1971 in the name refers to Attica prisoner uprising, of 1971. The line raised money for prisoner rights. "We see 1971 as a combination of both the political DIY cultures that we were radicalized in the Lower East Side, anarchist organizing where people sell T-shirts and throw parties to get their friends out of prison, and the really brash street and skate wear aesthetics that have been developing for ages," said Izzy Nastasia a Bruja member.
In 2016 the New Museum in New York hosted Scamming the Patriarchy: A Youth Summit that included Brujas as one of the organizers . About their work, Sara O'Keeffe, assistant curator of the New Museum mentioned, "Brujas is a critical voice among an emerging generation of artists, writers and activists who are propelling conversations about politics and forging spaces for empowerment."

Statue of William King

William King is an 1878 marble sculpture depicting Maine's first governor of the same name by Franklin Simmons, installed in the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C., as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. It is one of two statues donated by the state of Maine. The statue was accepted in the collection by Senator Hannibal Hamlin (who himself became the subject of Maine's second entry to the Collection) and Senator James G. Blaine on January 22, 1878 who rhapsodized upon the occasion, “He restrained the wrath of the impudent, quickened the zeal of the laggard, dissipated the fears of the doubting and molded his adherents and followers into a compact, cooperative, effective force . . . . He, more than any other man created the State of Maine.” 
The work is one of the few in the Collection done in an overtly neo-classical style, with King's cloak serving as much as a toga as anything else. Simmons, upon being commissioned to create a Roger Williams statue for Rhode Island moved to Rome where both good marble and good assistants were cheaply found, then moved there permanently so his King statue would have been made there. Sculptor and critic Lorado Taft found the King statue “well poised” but “with little vivacity or charm of modeling.” He then notes the severe treatment of the drapery.”

Christopher Massimine

Christopher Massimine (born 1985/1986) is an American theater producer and the former CEO of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene. In 2019, he was appointed managing director of the Pioneer Theatre Company at the University of Utah, but he resigned in August 2021, citing mental illness, in response to reports that he fabricated large portions of his résumé.
Biography.
Born in New Jersey, Massimine was raised in the Somerset section of Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey. He attended New York University, where he received a bachelor's degree, though he falsely claimed to have also received a master's degree from the university.
In 2016, Massimine was appointed chief executive officer of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene. Massimine was the executive producer of the 2015 KulturfestNYC, an international Jewish performing arts festival. Later that year, Massimine co-produced a tribute concert for Theodore Bikel who had recently died.
Massimine was an executive producer at the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene when the theatre was an associate producer of the 2017 Broadway production of "Indecent", which was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. In December 2018, Massimine was executive producer of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene's U.S. premiere of "Fidler Afn Dakh", a Yiddish-language production of "Fiddler on the Roof" which was directed by Joel Grey. 
In February 2019, Massimine was named managing director of the Pioneer Theatre Company at the University of Utah, succeeding Chris Lino who retired effective June 2019. Massimine's tenure began in July 2019. 
In May 2021, Massimine went on personal leave from the university pending an investigation after reports by Fox 13 and "The Salt Lake Tribune" that he falsified information on his resume. He claimed to have worked on various films, video games, television productions, and advertising campaigns which he was not actually involved with; paid to have laudatory articles published about him online; and claimed to have received a medal from an arts organization which did not actually exist, which involved charging the university $800 in travel expenses to receive the "award." Additionally, despite claiming to have received Tony Award nominations for his work on "American Idiot" and "Indecent", the Tony Awards confirmed that Massimine was not actually nominated. Massimine resigned in August 2021, after a report by "The New York Times" corroborated those reports.

Now United

Now United (sometimes abbreviated as NU) is an international global pop music group formed in Los Angeles, California in August 2017 by "Idols" creator Simon Fuller.

John Gast (painter)

John Gast (b. 21 December 1842 in Berlin, Prussia – d. 26 July 1896 in Brooklyn) was a Prussian-born American painter and lithographer.
His most famous work is "American Progress" (1872); this painting and many of his drawings are found in the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles.
Family in St. Louis.
He is the son of Heinrich Konrad "Leopold" Gast (1810-1898) and Bertha Pauline Henriette Volkmann (1819-1902). The family emigrated from Berlin to central Missouri wine country (present day Hermann, Missouri) before 1850. From there, the family moved to St. Louis a few years later. Leopold was a master lithographer, and with his brother August established the August Gast Banknote and Lithograph Company. It was a prominent printing house, making financial documents for governments, letterhead designs for industry, ornate certificates for churches, and many other paper documents for customers across the United States. The company exists today and its historic products are popular among collectors. John's brother Paulus became a prominent business and political leader in St. Louis. He established the Gast Winery in the Baden neighborhood after discharge from the Union Army in the Civil War in 1865, and this evolved into the Gast Brewery by 1900. The wine was shipped across the country and the brewery lasted into the 1940s.
Education in Europe.
John inherited his father's talent for lithography and was immensely gifted. He left for Berlin in 1860 to finish his education during the Civil War. He earned a degree from the Royal Academy there and returned to St. Louis to work at his father's company. After three years, about 1867, he went to Paris to study art. The 1870 Census shows him living with his parents in St. Louis but within a year, he was working in New York. His drawings from Paris, Missouri, and New York at this time are in the Autry Museum collection.
Life and career in New York.
He married Augusta Marie Catherine Stohlmann (1841-1924) of New York about 1870. The couple resided at 297 Adelphi Street in Brooklyn. They had at least three children. Son John survived only a year, son Karl married but died in his 20s, and daughter Mary Louise Katherine Gast (1879-1940), survived into full adulthood. 
In New York, John Gast helped launch the "New York Daily Graphic", a newspaper that had a special lithographic section. He worked at the paper for about five years, but went on to establish his own lithograph firm, Gast and Company. John received patents for several lithograph processes and equipment, such as a special lithograph screen that enabled color printing. His company became the Photo-chrome Company and later Grey and Company. He is considered the inventor of the three-color lithograph process. Failing health required him to step back from his business ventures. He died of liver cancer in 1896 at age 53.
Artistic works.
His most famous painting was "American Progress" that was commissioned by George Crofutt, a publisher who reproduced the painting in his many travel guides to the American West. The painting glorified westward expansion and is considered the American equivalent to Eugène Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the People" (1830). Some of Gast's other paintings include: "Bluffs on the Mississippi Below the Arsenal" (1865), "Angel Sitting on Mountain Top" (1871), "untitled" (mother adjusting a blanket...) (1870s)", American Prostonewares" (1872), and "Homeward" (a ship sailing under dark skies, painted March 24, 1896, a few months before his death and perhaps his last work). His works are generally signed and dated.

Charitable investment fundraiser

In Australia, charitable investment fundraisers (CIF) are not-for-profit entities with charitable purposes that take deposits from the public to finance those charitable purposes. CIFs may apply for an exemption from the requirement to hold an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) if the “financial products” they provide is limited to the issue of debentures or the running of managed investment schemes. For example, the solicitation of secured loans that are paid back with interest are considered debentures. Such deposit taking entities have since 2003 also been exempted from certain requirements of the "Banking Act 1959". 
CIFs must be registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, and, as charities, may also enjoy tax and other exemptions and benefits, such as deductible gift recipient status and exemption from income tax.
In 2013, ASIC estimated that there were more than 200 CIFs, with the largest funds being those operated by the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference.
AFSL exemptions.
Normally, an organisation that offers a "financial product" is required by Chapter 7 of the "Corporations Act 2001" (Cth) to obtain an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL), unless an exemption applies. By an instrument in 2002 under the "Corporations Act", Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) granted certain AFSL exemptions to CIFs including:
To obtain the exemptions, the CIF would apply to ASIC and provide an “identification statement” (a much less onerous disclosure statement than for regulated investment schemes). The CIF also needed to make clear to investors that their products are not fully regulated by ASIC.
After the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) was established in 2012, CIFs were required to be registered with the ACNC to be entitled to the exemptions.
In 2013, a consultative paper sought submissions on proposed amendments to the exemptions under Regulatory Guide 87. Changes were made in 2016 which:
None of the changes apply to fundraising from donations or bequests, in which there is no expectation of repayment.
CIFs that have been granted exemptions by ASIC, and do not hold an AFSL, must disclose that investments in the fund are not subject to the usual protections for investors under the "Corporations Act 2001" or regulation by ASIC.
In 2013, ASIC estimated that more than 200 CIFs were collectively managing more than $7 billion on behalf of wholesale and retail investors. The investments were mainly in the form of debentures, investment funds and interests in managed investment schemes. The largest funds were those of the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference, with 24 funds holding deposits totaling $7.49 billion.
Banking Act exemptions.
In Australia, taking deposits from the public is classified as a banking activity and is highly regulated under the "Banking Act 1959" (Cth). However, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has since 2003 exempted from certain requirements of the "Banking Act" entities formed for religious and charitable purposes, called religious charitable development funds (RCDFs), that take deposits (termed “investments”) from the public, subject to a number of conditions.
Changes were made in 2016, which came into effect on 1 January 2017, to restrict RCDFs being seen by the public as quasi-banks. If a RCDF offers an account to a retail investor without a stated term, the account will now have a minimum notice period of 31 days before a withdrawal, and any account offered to a retail investor that is a term investment is required to state a term of at least 31 days. RCDFs are now precluded from offering transactional accounts, such as cheque accounts, access to ATMs, EFTPOS, etc. The exemption order and list of complying RCDFs was updated in 2017.
RCDFs that have been granted an exemption by APRA are require to disclose to investors that the fund is not a bank and is not prudentially supervised by APRA, and that investors do not receive the benefit of the financial claims scheme or the depositor protection provisions in the "Banking Act 1959". They are also required to tell investors that they may be unable to get their money back.
There are currently about 60 RCDFs registered with APRA that have been granted an exemption. Between them, these funds have more than $7 billion in retail deposits.

Transviolet

Transviolet is an alternative pop rock band formed in the United States in 2015, consisting of lead vocalist Sarah McTaggart, with Judah McCarthy, Michael Panek, and Jon Garcia as musicians and writers. The band initially formed online before moving to the West Coast to collaborate in person. Transviolet gained initial recognition after a local publicity stunt, celebrity endorsements, and after being selected for a Google Play commercial. They have released three EPs and three singles, and have played a number of high-profile tours and festivals.
Career.
McTaggart originally met Panek on a musicians' networking website. At the time, McTaggart lived in Grand Cayman and Panek lived in San Diego, although as McTaggart later recalled, she initially lied on the site and stated she too was from San Diego because that was where she wanted but could not afford to move to. Panek in turn enlisted Garcia, whom he had known since they attended Churchville-Chili Senior High School together. The group, originally named "Noise Floor", collaborated at a distance at first before establishing itself in San Diego. After relocating to Los Angeles, McCarthy, another Churchville-Chili alumnus and friend of Panek and Garcia, joined the line-up and the name was changed to "Transviolet". According to the group, the name was inspired by the poem "When The Violets Roar At The Sun" by Charles Bukowski, and was chosen to mean "transcendence into a new, violet awareness".
Transviolet firstly began gaining widespread recognition with endorsements from Harry Styles and Katy Perry. McTaggart and Perry had known one another as children and attended the same church.
The band caused some controversy early in its career by sending out anonymous packages containing a cassette tape with "just press play" handwritten on each one. The packages were sent to members of the street team of Fueled by Ramen, a label distributed by Elektra Records. The cassettes contained a recording of the song "Girls Your Age", which was released online in mid 2015. A Shazam code was also included. The eponymous EP containing "Girls Your Age" garnered more than 20 million streams for its top three songs. The band toured with LANY in 2016. The song "New Bohemia" from the "Transviolet" EP was chosen for use on a Google Play commercial, and the band was named the "band of the week" by "The Guardian" in January 2016. That April, "New Bohemia" entered Billboard's Alternative Songs chart where it peaked at #35. In 2017, the EP "Kaleidoscopes" was released.
Transviolet was signed by Epic Records in early 2015. They split ways with the label in late 2017. They were then picked up by Sony BMG, followed by the release of the EP "Valley" in 2019. A track from "Valley", "Undo", featured as the closing music of an episode of the Netflix series "Unbelievable".
The group performed on "The Late Late Show with James Corden" on July 12, 2016. Transviolet also performed on the Today Show and "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert". They have played at a number of festivals, including Reading, Governors Ball, South by Southwest, and Firefly. In July 2018, the band headlined a hometown concert at The Echo (venue), Los Angeles. In September 2019, they self-released the single "Sunshine", followed by "Money Money" in October and "Born To Rule" in November. Later in November, in advance of a date at the legendary Troubadour (West Hollywood, California), the band guested on "Aliens" by The Griswolds.

Atlantic sixgill shark

The Atlantic sixgill shark ("Hexanchus vitulus") is a rare species of hexanchid shark found in the Atlantic Ocean. It was formerly described as its own species, but was synonymised with the bigeye sixgill shark ("Hexanchus nakamurai"). However, a study published in 2018 resurrected the species on the basis of molecular data. The species can be physically differentiated from the bigeye sixgill by its much smaller size.
The Atlantic sixgill shark ("Hexanchus vitulus") becomes sexually mature at around 1.40 to 1.75 meters. They do not reach lengths much greater than 180 cm.

Solnør

 
Solnør is a Norwegian farm in Skodje in Møre og Romsdal county.
The farm has been known since the Middle Ages because it was a subordinate estate, known as "Giskegods". The farmhouse was built by the officer Ludvig Daae (1792–1879) in 1825 and it received protected status in 1939. The house has a double-room layout with a central corridor, and the exterior has a classical symmetrical style with a large dormer and the main entrance in the middle of the facade. The door frame has a classical style with an arch over the top and columns.
The farm was purchased by Ludvig Daae in 1820, and it was taken over by his son, the politician Ludvig Daae; the two men were the uncle and cousin of Suzannah Ibsen. During his travels in Western Norway in the summer of 1862, Henrik Ibsen visited his wife's relatives at Solnør. The farm may have served as an inspiration for his play "Rosmersholm" (it may also have been inspired by the Molde farm in Molde and the parsonage farm in Herøy, where Suzannah grew up). Ibsen arrived at Solnør on July 16, 1862 and also became acquainted with the local historian Peder Fylling there. Ibsen copied or received a collection of local oral traditions from Fylling.
Magdalene Thoresen, Ibsens mother-in-law, was also at Solnør and met Peder Fylling. Thoresen used the lore that Fylling provided her with in her volume "Billeder fra Vestkysten af Norge" (Pictures from the West Coast of Norway, 1872).
Ludvig Daae hired the young Ivar Aasen as a private teacher for his children. It was during his time at Solnør that Ivar Aasen formulated his Nynorsk program in the essay "Om vort Skriftsprog" (Our Written Language). Aasen had previously taught at the home of Hans Conrad Thoresen, Ludvig Daee's brother-in-law and Ibsen's father-in-law. Aasen spent seven years at Solnør, and during that time he began studying the Sunnmøre dialect and also studied the plant life in the area.

Army Act

Until 1689, mutiny was regulated in England by Articles of War instituted by the monarch and effective only in a period of war. This abuse of the crown's prerogative (the crown's right to make and enforce rules for the military) caused Parliament to pass the Petition of Right in 1628. This Act stated that neither civilians nor soldiers and officers who were in England during peace were subject to military courts or law. Only common-law courts and courts of equity could exercise authority over individuals in peacetime England. Because the articles of war did not fall under these court's jurisdiction, military law couldn't be applied to anyone in England, whether soldier or civilian.
In 1689, the first Mutiny Act was passed which passed the responsibility to enforce discipline within the military to Parliament. The Mutiny Act, altered in 1803, and the Articles of War defined the nature and punishment of mutiny until the latter were replaced by the Army Discipline and Regulation Act in 1879. This, in turn, was replaced by "An Act to consolidate the Army Discipline and Regulation Act, 1879, and the subsequent Acts amending the Same", to be known as The Army Act in 1881.
The Army Act, 1881, applied to members of the regular British Army, whether during wartime or peace. Although the traditional reserve military forces (not to be confused with the newer British Army reserves made up of regular soldiers who remained liable for recall after completing their full-time engagements) of the Militia, Yeomanry, and Volunteer Force were increasingly integrated with the British Army during the latter decades of the Nineteenth Century, as with the previous Mutiny Acts, the members of these units were not subject to the Army Act unless embodied for active service or for training with the Regular Army. This remained the case with the Territorial Force (created by the amalgamation of the Yeomanry and the Volunteer Force under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907) and the Territorial Army as the Territorial Force was renamed by the Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921.
As specified in the Army Act, 1955, in reference to the Act's application to reservists, pensioners, and members of the Territorial Army:
A number of regiments of the British Army, most of which are reserve units on Territorial Army lines, based and recruited in British Overseas Territories, although technically falling under the remit and control of the British Government (as national government, whereas the territorial government is strictly a local government to which most areas of internal government have been delegated) exist under acts of local legislatures, requiring clauses of those acts to also apply the Army Act to these units. These units, as of 2020, include the Royal Bermuda Regiment (RBR), the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF), the Royal Montserrat Defence Force, with the Cayman Islands Regiment and the Turks and Caicos Regiment being in the process of formation. With the exceptions of the Royal Bermuda Regiment and the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, these units have been defined by the British Government as auxiliary to the British Army, making them British military units, but not acknowledged as parts of the British Army.
The Parliament of Bermuda's "Defence Act, 1965", which legislated the amalgamation of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery] and the [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps|Bermuda Rifles]] to form the Royal Bermuda Regiment (at the time, the "Bermuda Regiment") in 1965, specifies when the Army Act applies to personnel of the regiment:
The Army Act, 1881, was renewed by Parliament annually, unless both Houses of Parliament approved a draft Order in Council continuing its life, with amendments or consolidations as required. The UK Parliamentary website lists:

Caples House Museum

The Caples House Museum, also known as the Dr. Charles G. and Lucinda McBride Caples Farmstead, is a historic house museum in Columbia City, Oregon, United States. Dr. Charles Caples and Lucinda McBride Caples emigrated across the Oregon Trail as children and married in Oregon in 1855. Charles (1832–1906) was the first physician in Columbia County and built his home in 1870 during the early years of Columbia City. He and the Caples family made important contributions to the development of the town, including establishment of its first school. Lucinda (d. 1916) served as a midwife and her husband's medical assistant, and had family connections to many prominent Oregonians of the period. In 1959, the Caples' daughter, Dell Caples Houghton, bequeathed the house and its immediate surroundings to the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) for use as a museum. As of 2003, the property included the historic house, toolshed, and barn, a remnant portion of the Caples' historic apple and pear orchard, and four non-historic buildings including a gift shop and social hall. The house and toolshed remain in excellent historic condition.
The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The DAR continues to operate the property as a museum as of 2018.

Charles Denton Kemp

Charles Denton Kemp (23 April 1911 – 24 June 1993), was an Australian economist and economic policy commentator, and founder of the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA).
Kemp was educated at Glamorgan and Scotch College. After taking a Commerce degree at the University of Melbourne, he then worked in economic advisory roles in private enterprise, including as personal assistant to Sir Herbert Gepp, then managing director of Australian Paper Manufacturers. In 1940 he married Elizabeth Noel Wilson, and together they had two sons and a daughter.
With Gepp's encouragement, Kemp was instrumental in the founding of the IPA in 1943, of which he was later an economic adviser and director. His 1944 economic strategy, "Looking Forward" was described by Robert Menzies as ‘the finest statement of basic political and economic problems made in Australia for many years’, and arguably served as a central source of Menzies' later economic thought as Prime Minister.
In 1947 Kemp started publishing the IPA Review, initially as a means of disseminating his own ideas on industrial and economic policies, but later taking on a broader range of authors. The IPA Review remains in print as the IPA's flagship publication to this day.
Kemp was appointed CBE in 1959, retired as director of the IPA in 1976, and died in 1993. The IPA's annual C. D. Kemp lecture was named on his honour. His two sons, Rod and David Kemp, were the first siblings to hold simultaneous Australian Federal ministerial office. Rod Kemp also served as director (1982–89) and chairman (2008) of the IPA, while David Kemp is the current Chair of the Scotch College Board.

Tomiyama Taeko

Tomiyama Taeko (富山妙子, 6 November 1921 – 18 August 2021) was a Japanese visual artist whose work addresses themes relating to war and the complicated moral, emotional, and social issues of colonial and post-colonial history in East Asia. Her works range from paintings and prints to multimedia slide presentations and more recently, installations. Tomiyama died in August 2021, at the age of 99.
Life.
Tomiyama was born in Kobe, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, in November 1921. She spent her youth in Dairen and Harbin in Manchukuo. After graduating from the Harbin Girls' School in 1938, Tomiyama went to study at the Joshibi Women's School of Art and Design (now Joshibi University of Art and Design) in Tokyo, from where she later dropped out because of the Pacific War. She had traveled throughout Japan as well as internationally since the 1950s, using her art to express her commitment to social and political problems in the areas she visited. Her first experience was in the early 1950s when she went to work in the Chikuho mining region in Kyushu. From that experience she produced several drawings and lithographs and exhibited the works a few years later in Japan.
In 1978, Tomiyama was banned from entering South Korea on account of her artistic collaboration with poet Kim Chi-ha, who had been arrested for his pro-democracy activities and his criticism of the government's handling of the People's Revolutionary Party Incident.
Tomiyama's most prominent work was dedicated to the victims of Japanese imperialism, in particular Koreans, including women sexually exploited by the Japanese military known as comfort women.
In June 2021, Tomiyama was awarded South Korea's Order of Civil Merit for her contributions to the country's democratization process.&lt;ref name="5/18"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parish of Mount Wood

Mount Wood, New South Wales is a remote civil parish of Tongowoko County, New South Wales near Milparinka, New South Wales.
Geography.
Mount wood is located at 29°16′58″S 142°17′37″E, between Tibooburra, New South Wales and Pindera Downs Aboriginal Area. The Parish now lies within the Sturt National Park, and ruins of the Mount Wood Station on the Thompson Creek are preserved there.
The Geography, of the parish is mostly the flat, arid landscape of the Channel Country. The parish has a Köppen climate classification of BWh (Hot desert).
History.
The parish is the traditional lands of the Wangkumara People.
The first European was Charles Sturt who camped at nearby Preservation Creek (Mount Poole) for six months during 1845, and in 1861 the Burke and Wills expedition passed to the east, through what is now the Pindera Downs Aboriginal Area.
"The push for sheep pasture had reached the Darling River in the late 1840s and 1850s, and by the early to mid-1860s pastoralists were moving up the Warrego and Paroo rivers. By the late 1870s most of north-west New South Wales had been ‘claimed’ as pastoral properties though access to permanent water in the more arid country continued to be the key factor for establishing sheep stations. The discovery of gold in the Grey Range near Mount Poole about 30 kilometres south-west of present day Tibooburra, provided the impetus for an improvement in water supplies. The gold rush that ensued led to a rapid increase in the region’s population to about 3000 people and to towns like Tibooburra and Milparinka springing up. The gold finds also triggered a rapid taking up of pastoral runs in the district. The coincidental discovery of the Great Artesian Basin led to sinking of artesian bores and the beginnings of a major travelling stock route in 1884".
"Mount Wood Station was taken up in late 1881 or early 1882 over an area of 368,385 acres (149,080 hectares). The number of stock peaked in 1890 when 64,000 sheep were listed for the property, equating to a stocking rate of 1 sheep per 6.25 acres. By 1900 this figure had fallen dramatically to 37,316 (1 sheep per 10.72 acres) and at the time of the last shearing in 1972, to 16,000 (1 sheep per 25 acres). Drought, invasion by rabbits and depletion of native vegetation led to this rapid decline in carrying capacity for sheep and the belated realisation that the ancient, nutrient poor ecosystem was unsuited for this type of activity".
Sturt National Park was established in 1972. Today the entire parish is within Sturt National Park, and is also within a smaller Conservation area listed by the NSW Heritage office.

Elmina R. Lucke

Elmina R. Lucke (December 6, 1889 – October 31, 1987) was an American educator, social worker and international relations expert. After graduating from Oberlin College, she taught high school in Ohio and worked on social service projects before earning her doctorate in International Law and Relations from Columbia University. From 1927 to 1946, she taught at the Teachers College of Columbia making numerous trips abroad to study social work. In 1946, she moved to India to found the first master's degree program in Asia and second school of social work in the country, serving as its director for the next three years. Between 1950 and 1955, she served as a consultant to social work schools in Cairo, Egypt and Pakistan. From 1959 to 1965, she served as a delegate to the United Nations for various women's groups, presenting proposals on issues which impacted women. She was honored by the United Nations for her work in international relations in 1975 and was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1986.
Early life.
Elmina Rose Lucke was born on December 6, 1889 in Carleton, Michigan to Carrie (née Strait) and Jacob J. Lucke. Both of Lucke's parents were second generation German immigrants, whose families had been granted land bordering the Western Reserve in lower Michigan. Her father was a cattleman and livestock trader, while her mother raised Lucke and her younger brother, Ralph, encouraging them in their education. Elmina, named after a character in the book "John Bull, Uncle Sam and Johnny Crapaud" began her education in a one-room schoolhouse before completing her high school education at Central High School in Toledo, Ohio in 1908. Lucke initially began her quest for a university degree at Smith College, but after difficulties in the living and enrollment process, decided to attend Oberlin College, from where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1912.
Career.
Upon completion of her studies, Lucke returned to Carleton and helped found the first high school in the village, before enrolling in the University of Berlin to continue her education. Her graduate study award was eliminated because of the outbreak of World War I and Lucke returned to the states in 1914. Between 1914 and 1917, she worked as a high school teacher at Scott High School in Toledo. Beginning in 1917, Lucke was employed in several governmental social service posts, working as a director of services for the United States Children's Bureau of Gary, Indiana and the Bureau of Labor Statistics as a social research surveyor in Kansas and Oklahoma through 1919. Simultaneously, she attended courses at the University of Chicago in social work.
Under the auspices of the National Board of the YWCA, Lucke founded the Detroit International Institute in 1919. The organization aimed to provide social services to the half-million recent immigrants in the Detroit metropolitan area. Lucke served as the director for the first five years of the Institute's history, hiring staff speaking the 27 different languages necessary to communicate with their clients. She then returned to teaching high school in 1923. Based on her experience in international relations, she was accepted in 1926 to Columbia University's graduate program in International Law and Relations, as one of the first two women to enter the specialty. Earning her Master of Arts in 1927, Lucke was hired to teach at the Lincoln School of Teachers College, Columbia University, which also allowed her to pursue the research which she needed to complete a PhD. Between August 1930 and August 1931, Lucke traveled throughout Asia, conducting research and teaching which was enabled through funding provided by the American Historical Association. She returned to Columbia and taught until 1946. Simultaneously from 1937, she served on the national board of the American Council of Nationalities Service and was affiliated as an education consultant and social welfare advisor to the United Nations from its founding in 1945.
In 1946, Lucke took a sabbatical from Columbia at the request of the YWCA to found a graduate program for social work in India. At the time, there was one school of social work in India, located in Madras (now known as Chennai). The school's alumni, averaging about 40 graduates per year, were insufficient to provide sufficient service for the population and had to restrict their work to urban areas with high need. Lucke was hired as an advisor to develop a second school, which would also offer a master's program. For the first year, the school operated from Bombay (now Mumbai), visiting various regions to assess the needs throughout the country, speaking with those working in institutions, as well as conducting field work. On the eve of the country's Independence from Britain, the school, which had been intended to serve Burma (now Myanmar), Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and India, found itself also serving Pakistan and dealing with rioting as they moved to the new facility in Delhi. Lucke remained in India until 1949, as director of the school which became affiliated with the University of Delhi, and the first school in Asia to grant master's degrees in social work.
In 1950, Lucke went to Cairo as a Fulbright Scholar to assist in developing social work schools. Simultaneously, she worked as a consultant to the Point Four Program, launched by President Truman, which provided technical support to developing nations. Between 1952 and 1954, she developed an educational curriculum for social work in Pakistan under the direction of the United Nations Technical Assistance Program. Returning to the United States in 1955, Lucke was appointed to the Lincoln School's Board of Trustees and the following year was granted a Doctor of humane letters degree from Oberlin College.
In 1959, the International Federation of University Women (IFUW) appointed Lucke as the organization's representative to the United Nations. In 1964, she served as a delegate of the IFUW to the Pan-Pacific and Southeast Asia Women's Association (PPSEAWA) Tonga Conference, and attended seminars in Brisbane and Melbourne. The following year, she was appointed by PPSEAWA as its delegate to the United Nations, attending the U.N. Conference on Women in Teheran, where she presented a draft on issues facing women. In 1969, she resigned from the American Council of Nationalities Service and attempted to retire in Florida. Lucke was honored by the United Nations in 1975, for her work which was "marked by a sensitivity to indigenous people and their culture and a deep understanding of social structures and issues". She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1986 for her roles in developing international relations and social work. That same year, "Unforgettable Memories", a book printed in India was published about her time in the country, as a diary of her experiences. Unsatisfied with the portrayal, her memoirs "Remembering at eighty eight: Letters I should have written" were published the following year.
Death and legacy.
Lucke died on October 31, 1987, in Sarasota, Florida. Her papers were donated to the Sophia Smith Collection, Women's History Archive at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Delhi School of Social Work has instituted an award in her memory which is awarded annually to the student who scores highest marks in Field Work practicum of Social Work curriculum at postgraduate level.

Reika Iwami

Reika Iwami (岩見 禮花 "Iwami Reika", (born 1927 - March 18, 2020) was a Sōsaku-hanga woodblock printmaker who worked primarily with abstract compositions.
Biography.
Iwami was born in Tokyo in 1927 but raised in Kyushu. She later lived in Kanagawa. She studied part time at Bunka Gakuin, and then spent 11 years studying doll-making with Ryūjo Hori before turning her attention to printmaking in 1954.
She studied with Koshiro Onchi, a prominent founder of the Sōsaku-hanga movement.
Prints.
Iwami's prints frequently feature "sumi" black ink in solid geometric shapes combined with the organic texture of the wood grain, as well as deeply embossed paper and gold leaf.
In 1994, the art dealer Nelson Tolman wrote of her work:"Iwami’s subject is water and its flow, and her genius lies in the almost mystical ability to transmute the grain and texture of pieces of wood she has found into visual images of patterns of water."In his 1962 book, "The Modern Japanese Print - An Appreciation", James A. Michener described his first encounter with Iwami's prints, and mistaking the work for "another of the gifted young men who were knocking for admission to the ateliers of critical review" Michener concluded that "this Iwami, whoever he was, had already reached a point rather more advanced than competing artists who were just then appearing on the scene." Iwami was a prolific printmaker and among the first women printmakers in Japan to achieve recognition at the same level as her male colleagues.

Wilshire/Rodeo station

Wilshire/Rodeo is a planned heavy-rail subway station in the Los Angeles County Metro Rail system. It is currently under construction as part of the Purple Line Extension project, in Beverly Hills, California. Construction started in 2018 as part of phase 2 of the extension project. It is slated to open in early 2025.
The station is being built at the site of the former Ace Gallery on the Southwest corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Reeves Drive in Beverly Hills.
History.
Construction of Wilshire/Rodeo station was officially kicked off on September 23, 2019.
On March 31, 2020, the Beverly Hills City Council approved a proposal from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to fully close the two blocks of Wilshire Boulevard needed to facilitate the station's construction, taking advantage of lower traffic levels resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in California. This would allow for expedited construction of the station and better mitigation of construction impacts as opposed to the original plan, which would require alternating weekend closures for 13 weeks over a 3.5-month period, with completion scheduled for March 2021. Fully closing Wilshire Boulevard, which went into effect the next day and lasted until June 2020, expedited construction of the station by as much as six months.
Metro officially completed foundation and decking work for Wilshire/Rodeo station seven months ahead of schedule on June 14, 2020, with Tutor Perini, the project's general contractor, putting workers on extra shifts to further expedite construction. Wilshire Boulevard reopened in both directions later that evening, with construction and excavation activities continuing underground until that phase's scheduled completion in the first quarter of 2021.
Station layout.
Wilshire/Rodeo station was originally planned with a single entrance, located at the southwest corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Reeves Drive. However, as part of an agreement Metro negotiated with the City of Beverly Hills which was approved on February 28, 2019, a second entrance is being planned on the northern side of Wilshire Boulevard, with three locations being considered.
The station will be the only station in the Metro Rail system (aside from Union Station) to have public toilets, which would likely be built after the station opens, and may be built above-ground and/or integrated into a new development which would be built above the station.
Attractions.
The station is located in the Platinum Triangle neighborhood that includes the Rodeo Drive shopping district and its many hotels, including the Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, the Beverly Hilton, and The Peninsula Beverly Hills. It also lies a few blocks south of the Beverly Gardens Park and its Electric Fountain, and Beverly Cañon Gardens Park. It is also located directly next to Reeves Park.
Various fine dining establishments are located in the neighborhood, including Spago.
The Academy Headquarters Building along with its Samuel Goldwyn Theater, the Paley Center for Media and the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts are located near by. The Rodeo Drive Walk of Style aligns Rodeo Drive.

Konavade

Konavade (or Konawade) is a small village in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. Konavade, spelt officially as 'Konvade', is located on the banks of Vedganga, a tributary of the river Panchganga.
History.
The settlement at Konavde is said to be happened as a result of the Plague pandemic during the 1920s. According to the locals, the settlers were from surrounding villages and were in search of a safe place to settle, to be safe from the Plague.
Origin of the name.
The origin of the name 'Konavade' is disputed and different theories being in place, it is hard to conclude the same.
Geography.
Konavade is situated in the southwest part of Maharashtra. Being close to the Western Ghats, locally known as Sahyadri, it is surrounded by a number of sub-ranges of the Sahyadri.
Demographics.
As per 2011 Census of India, the population of Konvade is 2282. The village has a lower literacy rate compared to Maharashtra as a whole. In 2011, literacy rate of Konvade was 80.95 % compared to 82.34 % of Maharashtra. The Male literacy stands at 90.81 % while female literacy rate was 70.28 %. Scheduled Castes (SC) constitutes 9.11 % of the total population in Konvade. The village currently doesn't have any Scheduled Tribes (ST) population.
Religion.
All the inhabitants of the village follow Hinduism. Consequently, there are several temples of Hindu deities, Yamai Devi being the most prominent.
Economy.
Farming is the primary business of most of the residents. Fertile soil, abundance of water and use of modern farming techniques along with advanced machineries have greatly influenced the farming and have helped to attain maximum productivity. The type of climate and soil that exist in Konavade is favorable for sugarcane production, which is the primary crop here.&lt;ref name="Konvade Population 2019/20"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The abundant availability of water and well-spread irrigation enables farmers to take more than one crop per year which is usually rice followed by sugarcane or groundnuts. 
Animal husbandry is a common practice among the residents and as a side business, it helps the people to earn some extra income.

In-universe, Alida is a guitar-shaped island off the coast of Australia, built by the members of a band from the money made from their successful first album. They never released a second album and were forgotten by their fans. The band split, they each locked their fortunes in separate parts of the island and left. Arin, one of the previous members, goes to the island to attend a supposed reunion but never returns home. His wife Julia asks the player to head to island to locate her husband, and this is where the game begins.
Gameplay.
Being a "Myst"-like point-and-click adventure game, "Alida" sees the player navigate through a series of screens. Spanning 5 CDs, the game focuses on interaction with puzzles to progress to new locations. The puzzles lean toward musical themes and vary in difficulty. It incorporates FMV scenes and CGI animations, both blended into the scenery.
An interview with the creator is a bonus feature of the game.
Reception.
Inside Mac Games noted some of the puzzles' intense difficulty and praised the games audiovisuals. Applelinks felt the game had a satisfying ending. Mac Review Games urged readers to support the game due to its creator's "vision, creativity, and conscience". In 2003, Just Adventure thought Alida was a "phenomenal achievement", but that it could have been a much better game. In 2004, a separate review told readers to buy the game at retail price to support games like this being made. Gamezone felt that everything the title tried to achieved had been done better a decade earlier. "GameSpot" thought the game's potential was bogged down by its confusing and difficult nature. Universal Hint System recommended that players frequently save in order to revisit a dialogue or note that contained important information.

Councillors John A. Nucci and Dapper O'Neil were re-elected. Councillors Bruce Bolling and Rosaria Salerno did not seek re-election, as they were running for Mayor of Boston; their seats were won by Richard P. Iannella and Peggy Davis-Mullen. Iannella was the son of former Council president Christopher A. Iannella, while unsuccessful candidate Michael Travaglini was the brother of outgoing District 1 Councillor Robert Travaglini.

Kh-47M2 Kinzhal

The Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ("dagger") is a Russian nuclear-capable air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM). It has a claimed range of more than , Mach 10 speed, and an ability to perform evasive maneuvers at every stage of its flight. It can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads and can be launched from Tu-22M3 bombers or MiG-31K interceptors. It has been deployed at airbases in Russia's Southern Military District.
The Kinzhal entered service in December 2017 and is one of the six new Russian strategic weapons unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 1 March 2018.
Design.
The missile is designed to hit US and NATO warships posing a threat to strategic missile systems in European Russia part and to destroy NATO missile defence system and ballistic missile defense ships and land objects close to Russia borders, such as one in Romania. It is allegedly designed to overcome any known or planned US air or missile defense systems including MIM-104 Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System.
The missile first stage is probably shared with 9K720 Iskander and the guidance section is specifically designed for this missile. It can hit static and mobile targets such as aircraft carriers.
The missile accelerates to hypersonic speed within seconds of launch and performs maneuvers at all stages of the flight to evade enemy missile defenses.
Russian media claims the missile's range will be when carried by the MiG-31K and when carried by the Tu-22M3.
Operational history.
The first operational unit armed with the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles was formed in Southern Military District of Russia in December 2017. In May 2018, ten MiG-31Ks capable of using Kinzhal missiles were on experimental combat duty and ready to be deployed. By December 2018, aircraft armed with Kinzhal missiles had conducted 89 sorties over the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.
By February 2019, crews of the MiG-31K Kinzhal missile carriers had performed more than 380 training sorties with the missile, of which at least 70 have used mid-air refueling. The weapon made its public debut during the Aviadarts international contest in August 2019.
According to TASS, the first launch of "Kinzhal" in the Arctic took place mid-November, 2019. Reportedly, the launch was carried out by a MiG-31K from Olenya air base. The missile hit a ground target at "Pemboy" proving ground, reaching the speed of Mach 10. In June 2021, a "Kinzhal" missile was launched by a MiG-31K from Khmeimim Air Base, on a ground target in Syria.

Operation Manchester

Operation Manchester was a security operation conducted during the Vietnam War by the U.S. 199th Infantry Brigade in Tân Uyên District, South Vietnam from 4 December 1967 to 17 February 1968. 
Background.
Viet Cong (VC) forces operated a supply network of footpaths and ox trails parallel to the Đồng Nai river through western Tân Uyên District connecting War Zone D to southern Bình Dương Province. This supply route was defended by the Đồng Nai Regiment. Between 22 and 25 November the Đồng Nai Regiment had attacked the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 48th Regiment, 18th Division killing several dozen soldiers.
Brigadier General Robert C. Forbes planned to deploy the 4th Battalion, 12th Infantry to interdict the supply route and allow the ARVN 48th Regiment to extend security over the densely-populated hamlets along the banks of the Đồng Nai river.
Operation.
On 4 December, 4/12th Infantry commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Schroeder, began landing several kilometers north of Tân Uyên town. That unit together with Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 40th Artillery Regiment began constructing Firebase Nashua (). 
On the early morning of 6 December, a VC mortar attack hit Firebase Nashua, killing or wounding several Americans. At dawn, two platoons from Company A 4/12th Infantry and a scout dog team searched for the VC southeast of the firebase. That afternoon as the force moved through an area of thick vegetation it was ambushed by the D800 Battalion of the Đồng Nai Regiment in concealed bunkers, with more than 12 U.S. soldiers killed or wounded in the initial fire. Schroeder ordered Company C to assist, together with M113s from Troop D, 17th Cavalry Regiment and called for the Brigade reserve, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, to be flown in from Long Binh Post. These reinforcements were able to extract Company A by nightfall, they had suffered 25 killed and 82 wounded and 2 M113s were damaged by mines. 67 VC bodies were recovered.
Following that engagement Forbes reinforced his units, deploying the 3/7th Infantry, into the eastern part of Tân Uyên District, where it established Firebase Keane (). A battery of M55 self propelled howitzers from the 2nd Battalion, 35th Artillery, was deployed to Firebase Nashua. Forbes was also given control of the recently deployed Company F, 51st Infantry Regiment, a Long-range reconnaissance patrol unit.
On 19 December, a team from Company F, 51st Infantry, observed VC troops while patrolling the southern edge of War Zone D. A company from the 4/12th Infantry was landed by helicopter to engage the VC supported by helicopter gunships from the 3/17th Cavalry. The VC withdrew into War Zone D leaving 49 dead while U.S. losses were 7 dead.
On 27 December, the 4/12th Infantry engaged a company-size VC unit southeast of Firebase Nashua, killing 30 for the loss of 3 U.S. dead.
Aftermath.
The operation concluded on 17 February 1968. VC losses were 456 killed while U.S. losses were 37 killed. It was considered a success because the U.S. forces had kept the VC away from Tân Uyên town and the Đồng Nai river hamlets and prevented rocket attacks on Long Binh.

Sri Lanka Marine Corps

Sri Lanka Marine Corps () was formed in 2016 under the assistance of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit of the United States Marine Corps in November 2016 and received further training from the Commando Regiment of Sri Lanka Army.
The first group consisting of 164 Marines including six officers and 158 sailors passed out on 27 February 2017 in Naval Base SLNS Barana in Mullikulam in a ceremony attended by the President Maithripala Sirisena, Commander of the Navy Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne alongside the tri-force Commanders and senior officers. On July 29, 2017, Vice Admiral Wijegunarathna declared open the new Marine Headquarters, SLNS Vidura in Sampoor, Trincomalee.
Role.
Marines are responsible for carrying out amphibious operations and play a greater offensive role compared to the Naval Patrolmen that play a more defensive role protecting naval bases. While the more elite Special Boat Squadron (SBS) specializes in clandestine infiltration into enemy territory the marines launch aggressive sea borne assaults often with the intelligence collected by the SBS that land before them. In addition they are also trained for jungle warfare and urban warfare when pushing further inland as well as visit, board, search, and seizure operations.
History.
Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne WV, RWP &amp; Bar, RSP, VSV, USP, NI(M), ndc, psn former Chief of Defence Staff of the Sri Lanka Armed Forces. and former Commander of the Sri Lankan Navy was the founder of Sri Lanka Marine Corps. In 2016, Vice Admiral Wijegunaratne was able to take part in the US Pacific Command Amphibious Leaders Symposium in San Diego, California. Here naval leaders discussed new trends in amphibious operations. The Sri Lankan commander had already envisioned establishing a Marine element to enhance naval operations and the conference was a springboard for the new mission.
With the arrival of the amphibious transport dock USS "Somerset" (LPD-25) to Trincomalee, the men of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit began an exchange of training for local sailors drawn from the Patrolman Branch. The rigorous training would test the sailors mentally and challenge them physically. Endurance training is a key element of a Marine.
Marines represented Sri Lanka in RIMPAC-2018 international military exercise where they were attached to HMAS Adelaide of the Australian Navy. 
Training.
The first group of Sri Lanka Marines received training from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit of the United States Marine Corps in November 2016. At the conclusion of this course, a group consisting of 1 officer and 40 marines received weapons handling, rappelling and battle obstacle crossing training at the Commando Regiment Training School, Uva Kudaoya. The marines were also trained in the use of the M-16 assault rifle, which became their primary weapon. Emphasis was also placed on night time operating capability, combat medicine, life saving and underwater EOD (explosive ordinance disposal).

Project Allenby Connaught

Project Allenby Connaught is a scheme begun in 2006 to redevelop the military garrisons of Aldershot and Salisbury Plain in the United Kingdom. The project is named after Lord Allenby who served as a cavalry commander on Salisbury Plain, and the Duke of Connaught who was Commander-in-Chief at Aldershot Command.
History.
In April 2006 Aspire Defence won a 35-year private finance initiative (PFI) contract known as Project Allenby Connaught to provide over 500 new or refurbished buildings and deliver a range of services across the garrisons of Aldershot and Salisbury Plain, from construction to catering, stores management, transport, building maintenance, grounds maintenance and cleaning. These improvements, which were delivered by joint ventures of British company Carillion and American company KBR at a cost of £1.6 billion, aimed to improve the quality of life for 18,000 soldiers living and working at the garrisons and were completed in December 2014. Funds managed by Innisfree and by InfraRed Capital Partners also invested in the project. Sites around Salisbury Plain where improvements took place included Bulford, Larkhill, Perham Down, Tidworth and Warminster.
In November 2016 Aspire Defence won an extension to the contract under which it would deliver a further 130 new buildings, as well as extensions and alterations to existing buildings, as part of the Army Basing Programme in order to allow the return of troops from Germany by 2019.

The Bảo Đại Thông Bảo (Hán tự: 保大通寶) was a round Copper-alloy coin with a square hole produced by the Nguyễn dynasty under French protection and was the last cash coin produced both in Vietnam and the world, this ended a long series of cast Vietnamese coinage that started with the Thái Bình Hưng Bảo in 970. The cast Bảo Đại Thông Bảo were produced at the Thanh Hóa Mint, while the machine-struck variants were produced in Hanoi by the colonial French government. These coins bear the name of Emperor Bảo Đại who ascended the throne in 1926 but continued the production of the earlier Khải Định Thông Bảo (啓定通寶) that bore his father's name until 1933 when he ordered the production of new coins with his reign name, which was normal as previous Vietnamese emperors also kept producing cash coins with the inscription of their predecessors for a period of time. The cast smaller Bảo Đại Thông Bảo cash coins with blank reverses were only valued at piastre.
The Bảo Đại Thông Bảo were probably cast into 1941 or 1942 and the production was stopped because the occupying Japanese forces wanted the copper and were acquiring all of the cash coins they could find and stockpiling them in Haiphong for shipment to Japan for the production of war materials.
Cash coins would continue to circulate officially in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam until 1948 with an official exchange rate set of 20 cash coins for 1 đồng.
Machine-struck Bảo Đại Thông Bảo cash coins.
The French simultaneously began minting brass machine-struck cash coins in Hanoi, with the same inscription as the cast Bảo Đại Thông Bảo cash coins, with production officially starting in June 1933. These machine-struck cash coins weighed 1.36 grams and had an official exchange rate of piastre, but were probably only valued at piastre. 
These coins were minted at the Hanoi Mint (operated by the Banque de l'Indochine) because the French had cut the funding for producing cast cash coins at the Thanh Hòa Mint which meant that the Protectorate of Annam wasn't producing enough cast cash coins to satisfy the demands of the Vietnamese markets for these low value coins for every day exchange. The machine-struck Bảo Đại Thông Bảo cash coins were designed by René Mercier. 
The French authorities purely produced these coins for market liquidity and the French colonial authorities did not accept these coins for any payment to the government such as taxes or levies. 
There were two variants of this cash coins where one had a large version of the Chinese "大" (Đại) while the other had a smaller "大". After the Japanese had taken over the country, they forced the production of Bảo Đại Thông Bảo cash coins to stop because they were commandeering all copper in Vietnam. The Japanese created new sapèque-like coins that were made from zinc in Hanoi and by the Japan Mint in Osaka to replace these coins as the copper was being used for the production of Japanese weaponry and other military equipment, though the coins from Osaka didn't make it to the Vietnamese market as the shipping of war supplies was deemed more important by the Japanese government.
There were a total of 98,000,000 machine-struck Bảo Đại Thông Bảo sapèques produced.

Siege of Smolensk (1613–1617)

The Siege of Smolensk (1613–1617) is an episode of the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618).
Prelude.
After the tactical victory in the Battle of Moscow (1612), the Russian government made an attempt to repulse the Poles from the strategically important fortress of Smolensk. Russian troops without a fight retook Vyazma (July 7, 1613), Dorogobuzh, and Bely, an important outpost on the Lithuanian frontier.
Siege.
Russian troops for almost four years led a protracted and unsuccessful siege of the city, which consisted mainly of blockade of the garrison. During the siege, no attempt was made to assault. In the beginning of 1617, with the onset of the offensive of Polish–Lithuanian troops on Moscow (Wladislaw III campaign), the siege was lifted.
Aftermath.
The unsuccessful siege of Smolensk predetermined the unsuccessful completion of the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18). According to the Truce of Deulino, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth retained the Smolensk lands, which were captured by Russians only in 1654 at the beginning of the next Russo-Polish War (1654-67).
