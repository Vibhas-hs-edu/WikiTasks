Donald Court

Seymour Donald Mayneord Court, CBE, FRCSLT, FRCP, Hon FRCGP (born 4 January 1912 in Wem, died 9 September 1994 in Newcastle upon Tyne) was a deeply religious British, paediatrician who was known for his achievements in the fields of respiratory disease and the epidemiology of disease in childhood. He was also known for working, in a primary role, that established the importance of research into the social and behavioural aspects of illness in childhood.
Life.
Donald Court was the son of David Henry Court, a schoolmaster, and his wife Ethel Fanny (née Mayneord). Court was educated at the Adams Grammar School in Newport, Shropshire and in the local school in Redditch, Worcestershire. Court initially studied to be a dentist at University of Birmingham, but switched after three years into Medicine in 1936, winning the Russell memorial prize in neurology. As a resident, Court took a position in Queen's Hospital and Birmingham General Hospital. Positions followed at Great Ormond Street Hospital and later as paediatric registrar at Westminster Hospital.
With World War II approaching, Court could have been conscripted but was exempted as he was a member of the Religious Society of Friends and served with the Emergency medical services during the war.
After the war in 1946, he joined the department of health as a Nuffield fellow at King's College, Durham University. A year later he was appointed as a Reader to King's College, University of Durham in 1955, later the Newcastle University. In 1955 he succeeded Professor James Spence on his death, to conduct research in the Department of Child Health, becoming the first James Spence professor of child health.
In 1972, Court retired from the chair and became the Emeritus Professor of Child Health in the University of Newcastle. From 1973 to 1976 he was president of the British Paediatric Association, later called the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.
He married Dr. Frances Edith Radcliffe, in 1939 and had a daughter and two sons. In 1986, he suffered a serious head injury, from which he never fully recovered, and affected his retirement.
Thousand Family Study.
When Court joined Newcastle University, he became involved in the Thousand Families Study, a large and important epidemiological study, that was started by and among others, James Spence. During the period of the study, Court made over 3000 visits to the homes of families, selected for that study. Courts vision of the child changed during this study, and influenced him throughout his professional life. Instead of the prevailing view, which saw the child as a unit in isolation to be treated, Court now saw the child, as part of a network consisting of the family, the neighbourhood and the wider community, as a cogent whole.
Court took a specific interest in the common problems of childhood, including intussusception, Upper respiratory tract infection and the first to take an interest in speech disorders, and whose collaboratory efforts with Speech therapist led to a new university department of speech.
Awards.
In 1961, Donald Court was elected as a Fellow of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.
Court was awarded a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1969. In 1978 was awarded the prestigious James Spence Medal of the BPA, named in honour of his old colleague, James Calvert Spence. Professor Otto Wolff, spoke of the citation when awarding the medal to court, Wolff stated:
Court was awarded the prestigious Nils Rosén von Rosenstein medal of the Swedish Paediatric Association. A number of honorary fellowships followed over the years, including the Royal Society of Medicine, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, celebrating a very active life.

<doc id="56922749" url="?curid=56922749" title="Skif (ATGM)">
Skif (ATGM)

The Skif is a Ukrainian anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system developed by the Luch Design Bureau. Its guidance device (ПН-С) is developed and manufactured by Belarusian design bureau Peleng based in Minsk. The name literally means "Scythian".
The Skif is designed to destroy modern armored targets with combined carried or monolithic armor including explosive reactive armor (ERA). Skifs can attack both stationary and moving targets. They can attack from both far range (up to 5km in the daytime) and close range (100m). They can attack pinpoint targets like weapon emplacements, lightly armored objects, and hovering helicopters. In addition to manual operation, the Skif has an automated fire and forget targeting mode that does not require manual tracking of the target. In 2018, an upgraded export variant of the Skif was tested by the Ukrainian military.
Design.
The Skif consists of a tripod, missile container, PDU-215 remote control panel, guidance device and thermal imager.
The PDU-215 control panel is a briefcase-like laptop with a control panel, containing a small joystick and a flat-screen display to assist the missile’s guidance. Two firing modes are available: manual, and fire-and-forget. Fire-and-forget provides automatic control of the missile flight using a targeting laser beam. The PDU-215 allows the control of the unit from up to 50 meters away (with a wire channel).
A three to four-person team is optimal for deploying the Skif, operators require specially-made backpacks. Once the missile is fired, the operator controls the Skif and corrects the aim when necessary, by using the joystick on the remote control. The Skif's system has a shelf life of 15 years. The missiles have a 10-year shelf life.
The system comes complete with 130mm and 152mm caliber missiles in transport and launching containers. Tandem charge HEAT RK-2S warheads might be able to counter medium weight main battle tanks such as the T-90A with penetration of 800mm behind ERA. RK-2M-K warheads might be able to counter heavy main battle tanks such as M1 Abrams with their penetration of 1100mm behind ERA. The system also includes HE-fragmentation RK-2OF and RK-2М-OF warheads to attack infantry positions and light armored vehicles. The system can use all four types of missiles without requiring modification. The system has a thermal imager for use during night operations.
Variants.
The system has four types of missiles in two different calibers.
130mm Missiles.
130mm missiles with RK-2S and RK-2OF warheads: 
152mm Missiles.
152mm missiles with RK-2M-K and RK-2М-OF warheads: 
SERDAR.
SERDAR is a stabilized remote controlled weapon station (RCWS). The system was jointly developed by the Luch Design Bureau, Turkish company Aselsan Spets, and Techno Export, part of Ukraine’s Ukroboronprom enterprise. The system carries two (in some versions four) 130mm or 155mm missiles with RK-2S or RK-2M-K tandem-charge HEAT warheads. The system is also equipped with 12.7mm and 7.62mm caliber machine guns. A joint company for the production of Skif missiles was established in Turkey and production began in early 2020.
Shershen.
Shershen is a Belarusian ATGM based on Skif. It also has different types of 130mm and 152mm missiles.

2018 Euro Beach Soccer League

The 2018 Euro Beach Soccer League (EBSL) was the 21st edition of the "Euro Beach Soccer League", the annual, premier competition in European beach soccer contested between men's national teams. It was organised by Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW), in a league and play-off format.
This season, teams continued to take part in two divisions, the top tier (Division A) and the bottom tier (Division B). 12 teams continued to contest Division A, consisting of the top 11 finishers from last year plus Turkey who were promoted to the top tier. Whilst Division B accommodated 15 nations: 13 nations who did not gain promotion from last season, Georgia who made their debut, plus Greece who were relegated from the top tier at the end of last season. No nations returned after an absence from competing in recent years, however, the Netherlands, who had competed in the last two seasons, did not enter this year.
A total of five "stages" of fixtures were scheduled during the regular season. Each team from Division A played in two stages whilst each team in Division B played in one. At each stage the participating nations earned points for the overall league tables.
At the end of the regular season, according to the league tables, the eight best teams in Division A advanced to the post-season event, the Superfinal, to compete to become the winners of this year's EBSL. Meanwhile, the top seven teams in Division B (the four group winners and three best runners-up) and the team ranked bottom of Division A played in a different post-season event, the Promotion Final, to try to earn a spot in Division A next year.
The top scorer of the 2002 season, Alan of Portugal, announced his retirement on 11 June; Alan competed in all 20 EBSL seasons since the inaugural edition in 1998, meaning this year marked the first EBSL season in which he did not feature.
The league also acted as the qualification route to the 2019 European Games; the top six teams of the Superfinal plus the Promotion Final winners qualified to joint hosts Belarus.
Germany, the defending Division A team in the Promotion Final, beat Romania in the final to win the event, therefore retaining their Division A status for next season. Russia were the defending champions but were knocked out of title-winning contention in the group stage of the Superfinal, ultimately finishing fourth in the post-season event, just the second time (the other 2005), that Russia failed to finish in the top three. The concluding match of the Superfinal was contested between Italy and Spain, who were looking to end 13 and 12-year waits since their last respective EBSL titles (2005 and 2006). Italy, on home sand, won the match on penalties to claim their second European title.
Calendar and locations.
The schedule was announced on 23 March.
For the first time, Azerbaijan and Belarus hosted an EBSL regular season stage. It was also the first time since the 2013 season that no nations in Division B hosted a stage, only the second time this had occurred since divisions were introduced in 2002.
Teams.
The following teams have entered this season, in the following divisions (12 in Division A, 15 in Division B).

Final standings.
Finalists Spain and Italy faced each other for the first time in an EBSL title-decider; both teams were appearing in their second finals (the others 2014 and 2010 respectively) since they each last won their most recent titles (2006 and 2005 respectively). It was also just the second time (the other Spain vs. France, 2003) that neither Russia nor Portugal reached the final.
By winning the Superfinal, Italy ended a 13-year drought (the then current longest wait of any team with a previous title win) to claim their second EBSL crown; both titles were won on penalties. After nine successive wins, including claiming first place in the regular season, this was Spain's first loss of the season; their wait for a sixth title now continues into its 13th year.
Belarus' 5th-place finish was their joint best result (with 2016); the sixth European Games qualifier was therefore decided in the seventh place play-off between Ukraine and Azerbaijan, won by the former.

Revamp &amp; Restoration

Revamp: Reimagining the Songs of Elton John &amp; Bernie Taupin and Restoration: Reimagining the Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin are two tribute albums to English performer Elton John and his frequent songwriting partner Bernie Taupin. Both released on 6 April 2018, "Revamp" was described as John's project and features covers of the duo's back catalogue by pop, rock and R&amp;B artists, whereas "Restoration" was seen as Taupin's project and features covers by country music artists. "Revamp" was released via Island Records and "Restoration" by Universal Music Group Nashville. The release of the albums coincided with John's 2018–2023 Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.
The cover of "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" by Maren Morris which appears on "Restoration" received a Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance nomination at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.
Background.
On the decision to release two separate albums encompassing different genres, Taupin told "Rolling Stone":From day one we borrowed from everything that's good about American music – whether it's blues, country, gospel, pop, pure rock – everything got thrown in the mix. It would be tiring if you just got stuck in one niche your entire career, especially when it's one as long as ours. According to John, "We have two completely different albums; "Revamp" being the pop one and "Restoration" being the country one and God we have so many great artists doing our songs, it's quite incredible."
Of his "Revamp" record, John told "E!":It's always a huge compliment when an artist loves your song enough to take the time and effort to rework it. As songwriters, Bernie [Taupin] and myself are thrilled when singers we admire and respect as much as those on "Revamp" and "Restoration" choose to add their own unique twist in the process. It means that our music is still relevant and ultimately that our songs continue to reach new audiences. We're humbled and thank them all for their generosity.He added, "On "Revamp", I wrote out a wish list of people that I would love and asked them and to my surprise most of them said yes and we have quite an astonishing eclectic crew."
Of Taupin's "Restoration" record, John said, ""Restoration" was Bernie's project and he's a huge country fan. He came up with an astonishing list of country performers both new and legendary".
Cover art.
The "Revamp" album features a pop-art style cover based on the Terry O'Neill photograph of John, recreated in neon. The "Restoration" artwork was created by Taupin who wanted to emphasise the role that American culture played in his and John's careers, stating:For me, there's an irony about the American flag. It's been battered and beaten and burned, but it's resilient. It's always come back. I incorporate it with other things, and lately I've done a lot of pieces with deconstructed guitars and other found materials: barbed wire, broken bottles, things that people identify with on an everyday level. If it's on the floor and it works, I'll put it into the artwork. But it all goes hand in hand with my belief in America and my interest, I would say obsession, with Americana."
Reception.
Reviews of the two albums generally favoured the country reinterpretations of the John/Taupin catalogue, with significantly greater critical praise going to Taupin's "Restoration" volume than to John's "Revamp". The Metacritic score for "Revamp", which averages professional reviews from a wide range of media sources, was 58, indicating "mixed or average reviews." Meanwhile, the site assigned a score of 84 to "Restoration", indicating "universal acclaim".
The professional consensus in favour of "Restoration" centered around what was perceived as this volume embracing both riskier and rootsier arrangements. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called "Revamp" "slickly produced" and "dull", though giving praise to tracks cut by Alessia Cara, Miley Cyrus, Q-Tip &amp; Demi Lovato, and Queens of the Stone Age. The same reviewer noted that on "Restoration", "the artists take risks, and they -- and the songbook -- come out sounding the better for it."
Chris Willman of "Variety" magazine, while praising individual tracks by Coldplay and Sam Smith, opined that "the list of predictably commercial names that fills out "Revamp" sits at the intersection of tasteful and cash-grabby" and that "this feels like an album designed more to move tickets for his farewell tour." Conversely, Willman had little but positive things to say about "Restoration", singling out 10 of its tracks for special praise and noting of its country feel, "with "Restoration", it’s a treat to get reacquainted with Las Cruces Elton."
Jody Rosen of "Rolling Stone" gave three stars to "Revamp", stating that the "best moments on "Revamp", featuring big names from pop, rock and R&amp;B, are those least faithful to the originals." Rosen gave four stars to "Restoration", calling it "a revelation." 
In a three-star review of "Revamp", Michael Hann of "The Guardian" wrote that "When it's good, "Revamp" is very good. When it's bad, it's awful."
Grammy salute.
On 10 April 2018, CBS aired "I'm Still Standing: A Grammy Salute to Sir Elton John" which featured artists performing songs from the John/Taupin songbook, including many of the artists who recorded songs for "Revamp" and "Restoration". At the end of the broadcast, John and Taupin were given Grammy Awards: the President's Award.
House band.
Christopher Jackson, Gayle King and Neil Patrick Harris provided recitations of Taupin's lyrics accompanied by Valerie Simpson and Jon Batiste. Additionally, Harris, Anna Kendrick, Lucy Liu, and Hailee Steinfeld served as hosts introducing some of the performances. Neil Portnow presented John and Taupin with their awards on behalf of the Recording Academy.

Artificial Selection (album)

Artificial Selection is the eighth studio album by American rock band Dance Gavin Dance, released on June 8, 2018, on Rise Records. It is the follow-up to the band's seventh studio album, "Mothership" (2016) and is their third consecutive studio release with the same line-up. The album was produced by Kris Crummett, Erik Ron, and Dryw Owens, and was self-produced by Dance Gavin Dance, making it the first release by the band to feature more than one producer.
The album was supported by four singles; "Midnight Crusade", "Son of Robot", "Care", and "Count Bassy". To promote the album, the band toured as support on two of Underoath's 2018 North American tours, embarked on the Artificial Selection Tour, and performed at their own festival SwanFest. On May 31, 2019, the group released an instrumental version of the album to streaming and digital download platforms.
Background.
Following extensive touring in support of their seventh studio album, "Mothership" (2016), Dance Gavin Dance began writing and recording new material for their eighth studio album in 2017. The band released a studio cover of the Bruno Mars single "That's What I Like", for "Punk Goes Pop Vol. 7", on June 1, 2017. Soon after, the group released the stand-alone single "Summertime Gladness" on June 15. After touring internationally with other musical groups such as The Contortionist, Hail the Sun, and Polyphia, among others, and appearing on 2017 Vans Warped Tour, the band hinted at recording their eighth studio album in October 2017. The group performed their seventh album, "Mothership", in its entirety on The Mothership Tour in December 2017.
Dance Gavin Dance embarked on a headlining European and U.K. tour with American metalcore band Veil of Maya in March 2018.
Composition and recording.
The band wrote and recorded "Artificial Selection" beginning on October 17, 2017 at Interlace Audio Recording Studios in Portland, Oregon with producer Kris Crummett. The album was also produced by Erik Ron and Dryw Owens, in addition to Crummett and Dance Gavin Dance. Ron served as a mixing engineer on the track "Midnight Crusade" and Crummett served as a mixing engineer on "Son of Robot". The band's lead guitarist Will Swan is credited as an executive producer. Upon the album's announcement, clean vocalist Tilian Pearson confirmed that Kurt Travis is featured on the track "Shelf Life". Eidola vocalist and guitarist Andrew Wells, Strawberry Girls guitarist Zachary Garren, Secret Band guitarist Martin Bianchini, and Louie Baltazar are featured guitarists on the album. Wells also is a guest vocalist on the track "Evaporate".
In an interview with "Alternative Press", Will Swan commented on the band's writing process for the album and how it differed from previous recording sessions. "A lot of [this record] was written for singles, so it was written a little differently than some of the previous, instrumentally." Swan continues, "I wrote a lot of it for Warped Tour last year when we were trying to write a good single, so I wrote, like, 10 songs and we chose one ["Summertime Gladness"], but I really liked those other songs [...] so I kept them in my back pocket." Swan also expressed how he experimented with effects pedals on the album. "Guitar always sounds like guitar to most people and I like to try and make sure that when you listen to my stuff you don't know if it's a keyboard or a synth or some weird effect, because I'm trying to come out of left field." Tilian Pearson explained his lyrical writing process for the album, describing it as "more personal" than on "Mothership" (2016) and "Instant Gratification" (2015). Pearson expressed that his vocal inspiration for the album derived from Paramore's fifth studio album, "After Laughter", and drew melodic influence from 1990s R&amp;B groups such as Destiny's Child and TLC.

Murder of Simon Dale

Simon Dale (17 June 1919 – September 1987) was an English retired architect whose murder in September 1987 remains unsolved. Described as "an eccentric recluse", Dale was found bludgeoned to death in his countryside mansion in Hopton Heath, Shropshire, England. The only suspect, Dale's former wife Baroness Susan de Stempel, was cleared of his murder due to insufficient physical evidence. The case is noted as "one of West Mercia Constabulary's relatively few unsolved murders". Though the investigation did not finish with any convictions, there were successful charges of fraud against de Stempel, two of their children, and her new husband. The possible existence of £12 million worth of gold bars remains in doubt with no proof of their existence.
Biography.
Simon Dale was born Thomas Simon Savage Dale on 17 June 1919 in Richmond, Surrey to middle-class parents Beatrice née Pritchard and Thomas Lawrence Dale, an architect. Dale spent some of his architectural career restoring dilapidated country homes. Dale wrote scholarly works centring around Arthurian legend, though none were published. He believed that Hopton Heath was an integral part of the legend and that the Holy Grail was buried in the area. He ignored the scepticism of archaeologists.
Susan Wilberforce.
Susan Wilberforce, the great-great-grand-daughter of Victorian politician William Wilberforce, was 23 when she met Dale in London, he being fifteen years her senior. They married in 1957, and purchased Heath House two years later, saving the Queen Anne mansion, built in 1620, from likely demolition. The couple had five children but the marriage did not last. 
His eyesight failing, Dale struggled to find work; they chose for Susan not to find employment. The pair regularly argued and lived in different parts of the 50-room house, finally divorcing in 1972. The couple agreed in their settlement to sell Heath House and split the profits, but the sale proved impossible. For fifteen years "unstable house prices" and Dale's refusal to leave the house stifled any interest in the property. Correspondence between their solicitors continued but did not make any progress and neither side was able to support their case financially in court.
Susan found life after her first marriage to be very difficult and had to rely on handouts from her family, finding home in Docklow, near Leominster. She married Baron Michael Victor Jossif de Stempel in 1984, acquiring the title of Baroness. De Stempel was from a wealthy Russian family, the holders of an ancient Latvian title, and their marriage was part-funded by the sale of her aunt's jewellery. The relationship lasted just a year.
Death.
Dale lived mostly in the kitchen and one bedroom in Heath House, the remainder of the property left to gather dust. Two of his children, Marcus and Sophia, had been visiting regularly to help tidy the exterior of the house and the surrounding grounds. Susan admitted to having broken into the house to reclaim furniture that she considered to be rightfully hers. During this time Dale is said to have felt besieged, and there were several angry confrontations between the two parties. Dale was found dead in the kitchen on 13 September 1987, food still cooking in the oven, by Giselle Wall, his editorial assistant. Investigations revealed that his head had been bludgeoned with a hard, narrow instrument. Dale's headstone in the churchyard of St Edward's, Hopton Castle, is inscribed with "11/12 September 1987" as the date of death.
Trials.
Murder.
Susan, Marcus and Sophia were initially arrested on suspicion of murder, but the two children were dropped from the investigation after just a few weeks. Susan was charged with the murder of Dale but was found not guilty in the trial in Worcester Crown Court. The purported murder weapon was a crowbar that had been used by the three during renovations. It had been recently cleaned and there were no signs of blood. The prosecution said that they would accept a verdict of manslaughter, citing that Susan had been provoked by Dale's reluctance to sell the house. The case was presented with insufficient physical evidence and the charges could not be upheld. The case therefore remains as "one of West Mercia Constabulary's relatively few unsolved murders".
Fraud.
As part of the murder investigation, police conducted routine financial checks. They became suspicious of the fate of Margaret Illingworth (née Wilberforce), Susan's aunt and the second wife of former cabinet minister Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth. Margaret was suffering from dementia and was invited to holiday in the de Stempel home in Docklow in February 1984. While there her fortune, much of it in the form of gold bars and valuable paintings, disappeared. At the same time her money and shares were sold using forged signatures and the contents of her London flat were emptied and sold at auction. It is estimated that Margaret was defrauded out of around £1 million before being placed in the care of a nursing home in Hereford. She died in late 1986 and, as other members of the family were mostly unaware of her whereabouts, few attended her cremation. Margaret's will had been recently changed to remove her request to be buried in the Illingworth family tomb in Bradford. It also named Susan as the main recipient of most of her possessions.
While in custody from the murder trial in 1988, Susan remained under investigation for fraud in early 1990, two years later. Shortly before facing trial in Birmingham, Susan changed her plea to guilty of defrauding her aunt out of £500,000. Marcus and Sophia maintained their innocence, claiming to be the "unwitting tools" of their mother, and her husband Michael was also brought in. The four were found guilty, with the judge declaring Susan a "malign and appalling influence" on her children. Michael was believed to have used his understanding of banking and wills to aid the fraudulent affair. Susan was sentenced to seven years and Michael to four years. Sophia and Marcus were given 30 months and 18 months respectively. Investigations into the whereabouts of Margaret's thirty gold bars, valued at £12 million, proved fruitless despite a dig in the grounds of Heath House. The existence of the gold has never been proven.
Books.
The history of this case is detailed in "The Trials of the Baroness", a 1991 book by Terry Kirby. It is also the basis for the true crime book "Blood Money: The Story Of The Baroness de Stempel Scandal" by Kate Wharton.
Previous murder at Heath House.
Dale is believed to be the second person to have been murdered at Heath House. In 1968, local GP Alan Beach was shot and killed in his car on the driveway. He had been lured to the house by a man who was unhappy about the supposed late diagnosis of his wife's cancer.

Rano Rahi seamounts

Rano Rahi (Rapa Nui: "Many volcanoes") is a field of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean. These seamounts in part form a series of ridges on the Pacific Plate pointing away from the neighbouring East Pacific Rise and which were volcanically active until about 230,000 years ago, and possibly even more recently.
The origin of these seamounts is unclear. Proposals include the effect of tectonic forces on the Pacific Plate and the presence of mantle flow towards the East Pacific Rise.
Geography and geomorphology.
This field lies west of the East Pacific Rise, and covers an area between the Rise and 118° western longitude and between 17° and 19° southern latitude. The Pukapuka submarine ridge extends west of the field towards the Tuamotu islands.
The Rano Rahi seamount field consists of several chains of seamounts which emanate from the East Pacific Rise. These chains are lined up in the direction of the motion of the Pacific Plate and the farther away from the East Pacific Ridge the more the seamounts overlap with each other until they form ridges, which reach median lengths of . The seamounts in the field are typically less than wide but several kilometres wide; seamounts that are part of a ridge are between high. The total volume of rocks in the seamount province is about .
Geology.
The crust underneath the field is no more than 6.5 million years old, and it has a number of anomalous features in the field, compared to oceanic crust elsewhere. Vigorous hydrothermal activity and shallow magma chambers characterize the neighbouring sector of the East Pacific Rise, showing evidence of larger availability of magma.
Acoustic reflectivity indicates that a number of these seamounts were volcanically active in the last 200,000 years, if not within the last 50,000 years. Argon-argon dating has yielded ages between 230,000 years and 4.67 million years on rocks dredged from the seamounts. Paleomagnetism indicates that the volcanoes were active over two phases, separated by long periods of rest, and the first phase of activity occurred when the volcanoes were at distances of about or less from the Rise. Lava flows or landslide deposits appear to surround a number of the seamounts. 
A number of processes has been proposed to explain the formation of seamounts close to spreading ridges. In the case of Rano Rahi, both line-like sources and point-like sources of magma may be involved, with a common source of magma that results in a tradeoff between the sizes of neighbouring seamount chains. Seismic tomography has identified low-velocity material beneath the seamounts which may be flows in the mantle. The neighbouring Pukapuka ridge appears to be related to the Rano Rahi seamounts, which are located east of its eastern end and form a wedge-shaped extension thereof. Among the theories on the origin of Rano Rahi are:
Names.
Some of the seamounts and seamount groups have proposed names, like Beraiti, Haka, Hotu Matua, Huri Huri and Paiti; The names are mostly derived from the Rapa Nui language, which also lends the name to the field; it means "many volcanoes".

The William Bush House, at 1927 Tunnel Hill Rd. in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, is a historic house built in 1817. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
It is a two-story Federal style house built in stages. In 1817 a brick three-bay two-story central passage plan house was built. During the 1820s and 1830s lateral additions resulted in a seven-bay two-story house, with the additions including matching brick corbelling at the cornice and other matching details. A porch with Doric columns was added c.1910.
It was deemed "a notable example of an early 19th century brick residence" and is one of the oldest homes in the city limits of Elizabethtown. It is also notable for ties to early settler William Bush.

Namwon Seung clan () was one of the Korean clans. Their Bon-gwan was in Namwon, North Jeolla Province. According to the research in 2000, the number of Namwon Seung clan was 613. Their founder was Ming Sheng who was the second emperor of the short-lived Ming Xia dynasty of China. Ming Sheng changed his surname from Ming clan to Seung clan after he exiled himself in Goryeo.
The Chinese Ming Xia emperor Ming Yuzhen's son Ming Sheng was given the noble title Marquis of Guiyi by the Ming dynasty emperor Zhu Yuanzhang after his surrender. Ming Sheng was then exiled to Korea and Zhu Yuanzhang asked the Korean king to treat him as a foreign noble by giving his descendants and family corvée and taxation exemptions. These were granted by a patent from the Korean king which lasted until the invading soldiers in the Qing invasion of Joseon destroyed the Ming family's patents. The Korean official Yun Hui-chong's daughter would marry Ming Sheng in March 1373. Ming Sheng was 17 when he were sent to Korea in 1372 by the Ming dynasty. The Chinese Ming family exists as the Korean clans, Yeonan Myeong clan, Seochok Myeong clan and Namwon Seung clan.

Gower is the name of one of the electoral wards of town of Llanrwst, Conwy County Borough, Wales. It covers the northern part of the town, with its western border defined by the River Conwy and its southern border (dividing it from Llanrwst's Crwst ward) defined by the Nant y Fedwen.
According to the 2011 UK Census the population of the ward was 1,205.
County council elections.
The ward elects a county councillor to Conwy County Borough Council and, at the May 2017 election, the seat was won by Robert Jenkins for Plaid Cymru. It has been represented continuously by Plaid Cymru since 1995.
Gower ward became newsworthy in June 2004 when the sitting councillor, 74 year old Dafydd Parry Jones, collapsed and died while out campaigning in the county council election. Cllr Jones had been Gower's representative since 1996 and had been chair of the county council in 1998 and leader of the council's Plaid Cymru group. The election in the ward was subsequently postponed to 22 July.

Robert Brooks (MP)

Robert Brooks (1790 – 5 June 1882) was a British Conservative Party politician, businessman and trader.
Family.
Born in Laceby, Lincolnshire—and baptised there at St Mary's Church on 5 April 1791—Brooks was the son of yeoman farmer William Brooks and Ann Ostler. In 1833, he married Hannah, daughter of wine merchant Joshua Penny, and they five sons—including Robert Alexander, Henry and Herbert—and three daughters.
Shipping business.
Brooks was first apprenticed to Hull timber merchant and shipowner John Barkworth, under whom he travelled as supercargo to Mauritius in 1814, and India between 1818 and 1819, both times Barkworth's "Elizabeth". Between the 1830s and 1870s, he became one of the leaders of trade between Britain and Australia, with some connection found between his own career—involving exporting, importing, shipping, finance, banking, and political lobbying including promoting assisted emigration—and the development of the colonial Australian economy.
In 1820, he established his own London-based firm and, in 1823, he made his first and only trade voyage to Australia, travelling aboard the "Elizabeth", now his ship, to Hobart and Sydney. During the 1830s, he established business connections in eastern Australia and New Zealand, including Robert Campbell junior, John Rickards, and Raine and Ramsay, and became one of the largest importers of Australian wool. In this trade, he became chairman of the New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land Commercial Association, a London wool auction regulator, in 1846.
Throughout his working closely with trusted colleagues Ranulph Dacre from 1830 to 1843, Robert Towns from 1843 to 1847, and Charles Dickens' illustrator Octavius Browne from 1847 to 1855.
During his commercial ventures, he built a 12-ship fleet, including a number of whaling vessels, reaching over 5,000 tons but, in the 1850s, his interest in shipping diminished, and new investments in ships were only in those directed by business associates. Instead, he focused on financing the wool trade and other Australian ventures including gold mining.
In 1841, Brooks opened a small office in St Peter's Chambers, near Cornhill in the City of London, in 1855, he entered into partnership with Robert Spence, with the firm becoming known as Robert Brooks &amp; Co. Three of Brooks' sons became partners of the firm in the 1860s, before Brooks then retired in 1872. The firm existed long after his death, holding as one of the largest importers of wool to the UK, and remained in family hands, diversifying into management and ownership of tea plantations in Ceylon, until 1968 when it entered liquidation.
Corporate activities.
Outside of his own business, between 1837 and 1876 Brooks was a founding director of the Union Bank of Australia, a forerunner of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, where he was a proponent of private merchants. He was also a director of the London Dock Company, the Southern Whale Fishery Company, and the Great Eastern Steam Navigation Company. He was also a director of a number of insurance and mining companies, and other abortive steamshipping ventures, and actively worked to maintain synergistic relationships between Australian trade companies and colleagues in the City of London.
Political career.
In 1859, Brooks was persuaded by Conservative colleagues to stand for election in Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, who cited his maritime aura as a positive factor. He then won the seat, holding it as a backbencher until 1868 when he did not seek re-election.

The Branding Iron

The Branding Iron is a lost 1920 American silent dramatic western film directed by Reginald Barker and starring Barbara Castleton and James Kirkwood. It was produced by Barker and Samuel Goldwyn and distributed by Goldwyn Pictures.
Castleton appeared nude in the film which caused the particular scene to be cut in some parts of the country. Some municipalities banned the film altogether due to the topic of infidelity.
Though lost, its scenario is similar to another Barker film of 1920, "Godless Men" which does survive.

Bank Hall Colliery

Bank Hall Colliery was a coal mine on the Burnley Coalfield in Burnley, Lancashire near the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Sunk in the late 1860s, it was the town's largest and deepest pit and had a life of more than 100 years.
History.
The Rev. John Hargreaves (1732-1812), had purchased the Bank Hall estate—previously called Bank Top—by 1796. He entered the local coal industry through marriage in 1755 and in 1797 he acquired the lease-holds for most of the mineral rights in the area. After his death, the company adopted the name 'The Executors of John Hargreaves'. His nephew, Colonel John Hargreaves (1775-1834) continued the business until his death. His son had died young, and the property, including Bank Hall and Ormerod Hall in Cliviger, was divided between two daughters. The younger, Charlotte Anne, had married General Sir James Yorke Scarlett, a hero of the Battle of Balaclava, but the couple produced no offspring. The elder, Eleanor Mary, married the Rev. William Thursby and thus the company came under the control of the Thursby family. The Bank Hall estate covered a greater area than the later coal mine, with the hall itself located on the southwest side of the canal next to Colne Road. Its grounds on the River Brun, today make up part of Thompson Park. The estate also presumably covered the site of Queen's Park—southeast of the mine—which was donated to the Burnley Corporation by Sir John Hardy Thursby in 1888, for the purpose of creating the first public park in the town.
Bank Hall Colliery's first shafts were sunk to the Arley mine at a depth of 287 yards by Executors of John Hargreaves between 1865 and 1869. The four feet thick seam was worked until 1925. The King mine was worked between 1905 and 1925, and the Dandy (or Upper Arley) mine from 1910 to 1935. No. 3 shaft was sunk to the Dandy mine in 1903 and became known as the Dandy Pit.
No.4 shaft was sunk to the Union mine, which had been formed by the merger of the Upper Foot and true Lower Mountain mines. Production from the Union mine started in 1915 and became the pit's the major source of coal. The fourth shaft at 1,500 feet was the deepest in the coalfield.
Worsley Mesnes Ironworks in Wigan built a twin horizontal winding engine with 26 inch cylinders for No. 1 shaft in 1912. Its 18 foot drum could wind up to 1,554 feet. Yates &amp; Thom of Blackburn built No. 4 shaft's cross compound horizontal engine in 1914. It had 38 inch and 60 inch cylinders, a 19 feet drum and could wind to 1,464 feet. Walker Brothers of Wigan supplied a steam fan engine with a 5 feet diameter fly wheel.
The colliery was taken over by the National Coal Board (NCB) on 1 January 1947 and significant investments were made. Haulage roads were made for battery locomotives, which pulled five-ton mine cars and the pit botton at No.4 Shaft was modernised.
The Union mine proved to be gassy and ignitions of firedamp were caused by sparks made when mechanised cutter picks hit coal balls containing nodules of iron pyrites. The problems led to the NCB stopping the last coal face working in January 1971 and closed the pit on 17 April. Salvage work was completed and the site cleared in 1972.

Moscow Apartment's self-titled debut was produced by Samantha Martin of Delta Sugar, three of the tracks were mixed by Guillermo Subauste, and features Michael Louis Johnson, member of Rambunctious, former lead singer of The New Kings, and brother of Gordie Johnson on trumpet. "Blues and Roots Radio" noted in a review by Phillip Bridle that "the maturity in the song writing and musical skills of the pair is quite remarkable... [T]his first EP of five beautifully crafted songs is surely an indicator of special things to come." Shortly thereafter, NOW Magazine included Moscow Apartment in its list of Toronto Musicians to Watch in 2018.
"Better Daughter".
Released July 10, 2020, the majority of "Better Daughter" was produced by Fry and Padilla in collaboration with Guillermo Subauste of Pacha Sound, who also worked as the recording engineer, while the song "Two Timer" was produced by Grammy-winning producer and recording engineer Vance Powell. In writing the EP, Moscow Apartment also collaborated with Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene and Juno-winner Chin Inejti. The EP was mixed by Scotty Hard.
Exclaim! magazine wrote in its review that the album helps "solidify what's been obvious for years: that everyone ought to know and care about Moscow Apartment,", and CBC named it one of the "22 albums you need to hear" in the summer of 2020.

Russian Athletics Championships

The Russian Athletics Championships () is an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF), which serves as the Russian national championship for the sport. It is typically held as a four-day event in the Russian summer around late June to early August. The venue of the championships is decided on an annual basis.
The competition was first held in 1908, during the time of the Russian Empire. The competition had nine editions during this period, lasting up to 1916, at which point it was ceased as a result of the October Revolution and was effectively replaced in 1920 by the inauguration of the Soviet Athletics Championships. During this period, separate championships for the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic were occasionally held (with the first two editions occurring in 1922 and 1927 in Moscow), though mostly the Russian championships was merged into the larger Soviet one. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia was restored as an independent country and the Russian Athletics Championships was re-initiated, starting from 1992 after a shared CIS Athletics Championships in 1991.
The modern Russian Championships are using as a qualifying event for selection for the international team for major events including the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics.
Events.
On the current programme a total of 38 individual Russian Championship athletics events are contested, divided evenly between men and women. For each of the sexes, there are six track running events, three obstacle events, four jumps, four throws, and two relays.
Separate championships are held for the 10,000 metres, combined track and field events, racewalking, road running, cross country running (spring and autumn), mountain running (uphill and downhill), 24-hour run, and relay races. A winter outdoor throwing championships is also held in discus, javelin and hammer throw, while the shot put is incorporated into the Russian Indoor Athletics Championships.

<doc id="56923243" url="?curid=56923243" title="Indianization of Southeast Asia">
Indianization of Southeast Asia

Dating back to the first century, Indian culture started making its way into the region of Southeast Asia. The expansion of Indian culture into these areas was given the term "Indianization". The term was coined by French archaeologist, George Coedes in his work "Histoire ancienne des états hindouisés d'Extrême-Orient" (The Indianized States of Southeast Asia). He defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism and the Sanskrit dialect. A large number of nations came under the influence of the Indosphere becoming a part of Greater India, the cultural expansion caused the Sanskritization of South East Asia, the rise of Indianized kingdoms, spread of Hinduism in Southeast Asia and the Silk road transmission of Buddhism. Indian honorifics were adopted into the Malay, Thai, Filipino and Indonesian languages. The Indian diaspora, both historical (PIO or Person of Indian-Origin) and current (NRI or Non-Resident Indian), play an ongoing key role in the region in terms of geopolitical, strategic, trade, cultural traditions, and economic aspects, with most Southeast Asian countries having sizable Indian communities alongside often much larger ethnic Chinese minorities.
The spread of Indianization.
There are many different theories for how Indianization spread throughout insular and mainland Southeast Asia. These differing theories each argue for a different caste of Indians as being the main propagator of Indian language and culture into Southeast Asia.
Theory of the Vaishya traders.
The first of these theories focuses on the caste of Vaishya traders, and their role for bringing Indian traditions into Southeast Asia through trade. Southeast Asia was rich in resources that were desired in the Indian sub-continent, the most important of which being gold.
During the 4th century c.e. the Indian subcontinent was at a deficiency for gold due to extensive control of overland trade routes by the Roman Empire, and this period is when we see the first evidence of Indian trade in Southeast Asia. Vaishya traders had turned to maritime trade to acquire gold, and they set their sails for Southeast Asia. However, the conclusion that Indianization was just spread through trade is insufficient, as Indianization permeated through all classes of Southeast Asian society, not just the merchant classes
Theory of the Kshatriya warriors.
Another theory states that Indianization spread through the Kshatriya class of warriors. This hypothesis does a good job at explaining state formation in Southeast Asia, as these warriors came with the intention of conquering the local peoples and establishing their own political power in the region. However, this theory has not attracted much interest from historians as there is very little literary evidence to support it.
Theory of the Brahmins.
The most widely accepted theory for the spread of Indianization into Southeast Asia is through the class of Brahmin scholars. These Brahmins used the maritime routes established by the Vaishya traders, and brought with them many of the Hindu religious and philosophical traditions to spread to the elite classes of Southeast Asia. Once these traditions were adopted into the elite classes, it disseminated throughout all the lower classes, thus explaining the Indianization present in all classes of Southeast Asian society. Brahmins had influence beyond just the fields of religion and philosophy however, and soon Southeast Asia had adopted many Indian influenced codes of law and architecture.
A combination of all three theories can explain the Indianization of Southeast Asia, rather than just choosing one. There was an extensive maritime trade network, which allowed for traders to extract gold and spices from Southeast Asia. Once these trade networks had been established, it paved the way for new classes of warriors to exert military prowess over select Southeast Asian areas. Finally, these extensive trade networks also allowed for the influx of Brahmin scholars, who impressed many Southeast Asian elites with their knowledge of law, arts, philosophy. Thus through the Brahmin scholars many of these Indian and Hindu practices were propagated throughout all social classes Southeast Asia.
Literature.
Scripts in Sanskrit discovered during the early centuries of the Common Era are the earliest known forms of writing to have extended all the way to Southeast Asia. Its gradual impact ultimately resulted in its widespread domain as a means of dialect which evident in regions, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand and additionally a few of the larger Indonesian islands. In addition, alphabets from languages spoken in Burmese, Thai, Laos and Cambodia are a variations formed off of Indian ideals that have localized the language.
The utilization of Sanskrit has been prevalent in all aspects of life including legal purposes. Sanskrit terminology and vernacular appears in ancient courts to establish procedures that have been structured by Indian models such as a system composed of a code of laws. The concept of legislation demonstrated through codes of law and organizations particularly the idea of "God King" was embraced by numerous rulers of Southeast Asia. The rulers amid this time, for example, the Lin-I Dynasty of Vietnam once embraced the Sanskrit dialect and devoted sanctuaries to the Indian divinity Shiva. Many rulers following even viewed themselves as “reincarnations or descendants” of the Hindu gods. However once Buddhism began entering the nations, this practiced view was eventually altered.
Religion.
The effects of Hinduism and Buddhism applied a tremendous impact on the many civilizations inhabiting Southeast Asia which significantly provided some structure to the composition of written traditions. An essential factor for the spread and adaptation of these religions originated from trading systems of the third and fourth century. In order to spread the message of these religions Buddhist monks and Hindu priests joined mercantile classes in the quest to share their religious and cultural values and beliefs. Along the Mekong delta, evidence of Indianized religious models can be observed in communities labeled Funan. There can be found the earliest records engraved on a rock in Vocanh. The engravings consist of Buddhist archives and a south Indian scripts written in Sanskrit that have been dated to belong to the early half of the third century. Indian religion was profoundly absorbed by local cultures that formed their own distinctive variations of these structures in order to reflect their own ideals.
The Mandala.
The Mandala is a religious symbol representing the universe and is also involved in the political system of Southeast Asia. The center of the Mandala is considered to contain the power while the power then spreads outwards. This replicates the how the political system within Southeast Asia has a powerful center of administration. The Mandala, just like a political system, changes from empire to empire with its relation to the King and the empire.
Caste System.
According Hindu belief system, the caste system divides all people of the world into a hierarchical groups based on their work (karma) and duty (dharma). There is absolutely no evidence of hierarchy in caste systems among Hindus according to Sacred Books. The land workers were called Shudras. The Business workers called Vaishyas. The Warriors or those who maintained social order were called Kshatriyas. Those who memorized key mathematical formulas, philosophical precepts, and other knowledge systems and retained in memory were called Brahmins. The caste system, defined by a non-authoritative book on Hindu law wrote that the system is a basis of order and regularity of society. 
The Brahmins from the Indian culture spread their religion to southeast Asia. By traveling to these countries they were able to inform others on their beliefs and spark the beginning of the Hindu and Buddhist cultures in Southeast Asia. These Brahmins introduced the caste system to all the countries; however, more so in Java, Bali, Madura, and Sumatra. Unlike India the caste system was not as strict. As a result of all these different writings, there are big speculations that the Brahmins has a big role on their religion. There are multiple similarities between the two caste systems such that both state that no one is equal within society and that everyone has their own place. It also promoted the upbringing of highly organized central states. Although they have some similarities, Southeast Asians did not use the Hindu system entirely and adjusted what they did use to their local context. The Brahmins were still able to implement their religion, political ideas, literature, mythology, and art
Historiography of South East Asia.
The history of South East Asia was mostly always written from the perspective of external civilizations that influenced the region. The prevalent interpretation caused mainly because of the ontological differences, fundamentally dichotomous histories of Europe and pre colonial Asia, was apparently that the despotism, obscurantism, servile equality of Asian societies along with innovation becoming prey to tyranny had rendered history cyclical, immobile and non-linear.
The belief in the idea that South East Asia had never engendered its own civilization, and of indigenous incapacity or external benefaction gained additional support, such was the tremendous evidence of Indian architectural and religious influence in South East Asia and we're fundamentally identified as being derivative and thus Indianization was perceived as occurring more so due to the Indian initiatives rather than the indigenous initiatives of South East Asia.
Development of caste system.
Another main concern for indianization was the understanding and development of caste systems. The debate was often whether or not the caste systems were seen as an elite process or just the process of picking up the Indian culture and calling it their own in each region. This had showed that the Southeast Asian countries were civilized and able to flourish their own interests. For example, Cambodia's caste system is based on people in society. However, in India, the caste system was based on which class they belonged to when they were born. Based on the evidence of the caste system in Southeast Asia, shows that they were applying Indian culture to their own, also known/seen as indianization.
Similar to the caste systems, the cultures were a huge part of determining the legitimacy of indianization. Many argue that only writing could really date the culture and prove indianization. The lives of rulers, daily lives of people, rituals of funeral, weddings and specific customs were a few that helped anthropologists date the indianization of countries. The religions found in India and Southeast Asian countries was another piece of evidence that led anthropologists to understand where the cultures and customs were adopted from.
Decline of Indianization.
Rise of Islam.
During the 13th century, Islam began to replace the Hindu religion/culture in much of Southeast Asia. The process of Islam coming to the traditional Hinduism kingdoms began with Muslim Indians merchants spreading their trade all over Southeast Asia. Moreover, as trade became more saturated in the Southeast Asian regions wherein Indianization once persisted, the regions had become more Muslim populated. This so-called Islamization has spread to many of the trading centers across the regions of Southeast Asia, including one of the most dominant centers, Malacca.
Distinction from colonialism.
Amitav Acharya argues that "Indianization is different from traditional colonialism" due to the fact that "it doesn’t involve strangers coming in and taking over an unknown land."
Instead, Indian influence from trade routes and language use slowly permeated through Southeast Asia, making the traditions a part of the region. The interactions between India and Southeast Asia were marked by waves of influence and dominance. At some points the Indian culture solely found its way into the region, and at other points the influence was used to take over. Indianization and its influence was seen in nearly all aspects of Southeast Asian society and history. Before the rise of Indianisation, influence of Indian culture, and the introduction of Islam the history of Southeast Asia and its people was unrecorded. The beginning of Indianization marked the start of cultural organization, rise of monarchical kingdoms in Southeast Asia

1992 Italian Senate election in Lombardy

Lombardy elected its eleventh delegation to the Italian Senate on April 5, 1992. This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1992 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race.
The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the Swiss-bordering Province of Varese and Province of Como preferred the federalist Northern League.
Background.
After quite five decades of exceptional political stability, the election of 1992 marked a revolution. Umberto Bossi's Northern League, acting as a catch-all party, took votes from all other parties on a base of tax protest and a federalist project. Christian Democracy lost more than in the previous 30 years, the former Communists, now divided between the Democratic Party of the Left and the Communist Refoundation Party, more than ever, as well as all the other parties.
Electoral system.
The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected.

Hogood Coffee

Hogood Coffee () is a Chinese maker of coffee products. It is the largest domestic instant coffee producer.
Corporate affairs.
The company's second largest shareholder is Chongqing Energy International (Hong Kong) Co Ltd., which also established the Chongqing Coffee Exchange, a spot trading center for coffee beans.
History.
The company was founded in 2007. It had been a supplier of coffee beans to Nestle before launching its own brand of instant coffee. Hogood Coffee, launched instant coffee with walnut protein powder instead of non-dairy creamer.
Planting and processing.
Hogood produces 200,000 (Incorrect information, the whole of Yunnan province only produces approx. 100,000mt of green coffee annually) metric tons of primarily Arabica beans annually. Hogood plants much of the coffee in its home region of Dehong, one of the 3 primary regions for coffee cultivation in Yunnan. The company contracts farm land from smallholders and plants seedlings, and then re-contracts the land back to farmers to purchase the coffee beans from the farmers at harvest. Due to the smallholdings typical in China, by employing a scheme to consolidate farm lands, productivity is increased. The success of the scheme relies on relaxed land use laws.
The company is investing in a RMB 1 billion (US$145 million) scheduled to be completed in 2018 to produce an announced 10,000 tonnes of freeze-dried coffee, 2,000 tonnes of liquid coffee concentrate and 3,000 tonnes of baked coffee beans annually.
Marketing and exports.
Hogood markets its own brand of instant coffee and roasted whole beans. In the domestic market for instant coffee, Nestle dominates with a market share of over 70% while Hogood only held 2.7% in 2014.
Hogood accounts for about half of the country's coffee exports. Since July 2015 the company has shipped coffee to Europe through the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe railway link, which passes through Kazakhstan before reaching Duisburg, Germany, taking 14 days over the 30-35 days of the earlier used sea route from Guangzhou.
In popular culture.
During a Ministry of Foreign Affairs reception in Beijing in February 2017 to introduce Yunnan to the diplomatic community, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi praised the company: “The coffee I just drank is called Hogood. I am not exaggerating -- this is the best coffee that I have ever tasted as a globetrotter.”

Luke Anguhadluq

Luke Anguhadluq (1895–1982; Inuktitut syllabics: ᓗᒃ ᐊᖑᐊᓗᖅ) was an Inuit Canadian artist in Baker Lake.
Biography.
Luke Anguhadluq was born at Chantrey Inlet in 1895 to the Utkuhikhalingmiut (meaning "people of the stone for cooking pots") people. Anguhadluq grew up living traditionally off of the land in the Back River area and by the age of 28 was considered to be a mature hunter and eventually a respected camp leader. The Utkuhikhalingmiut remained largely unaffected by settling Europeans and continued their traditions into the 1950s. A famine, resulting from a shift in the migratory patterns of caribou away from Back River, caused Anguhadluq and his extended family to leave the area. Anguhadluq led his family to Schultz Lake and Whitehills Lake before settling in Qamani'tuaq, or Baker Lake, in 1961.
Anguhadluq's family arranged for him to marry his cousin Jessie Oonark, who is also a well-known artist, but the union never took place. Luke Anguhadluq had 3 wives and 7 children, including two sons whom he adopted. One of Anguhadluq's wives, Marion Tuu'luq, was also an artist specializing in wall-hangings and drawings.
Anguhadluq continued to live in an igloo in the winter and a skin tent in the summer until he was 72. The artist hunted and fished almost daily on the lands around Baker Lake. Luke Anguhadluq died on 2 February 1982 at the age of 87 in Baker Lake. As per his wishes, Anguhadluq was not buried in the Anglican cemetery and his body was instead taken by dogsled to a hill overlooking Baker Lake where he spent many hours watching for caribou.
Artistic career.
Anguhadluq began his career as an artist when he was 65. It has been suggested that he could have been persuaded by Jessie Oonark's prosperity as an artist to begin exploring his illustrative talents. Anguhadluq took advantage of the crafting materials that were easily accessible in Baker Lake and created drawings, prints and sculptures early in his career. Anguhadluq would often draw sitting on the ground with the paper situated between his stretched-out legs, rotating the page as he went.
Crafts Officers in Baker Lake quickly took notice of Anguhadluq's talent and encouraged him to continue drawing. Some of Anguhadluq's prints were sent in a collection to the Canadian Eskimo Arts Council, which resulted in the creation and development of a printmaking initiative in Baker Lake in 1969. Many of Anguhadluq's drawings were then made into prints, often by his sons, Thomas Iksiraq and Barnabus Oosuaq, who became printmakers. Luke Anguhadluq's prints, 81 in total, were a part of each annual Baker Lake Print Collection until he died. Jack Butler, a Craft Officer from 1969 to 1972 described Anguhadluq as a respected patriarch and his art was respected by the community as a result. For example, printmakers were encouraged to modify the base illustrations for their prints as they saw fit, but Anguhadluq's drawings remained unaltered in admiration of him.
Style.
Anguhadluq's drawings depicted Utkuhikhalingmiut customs and his own lived experiences of these events. Hunting, drum dancing and people in Anguhadluq's community were often his inspirations. After being encouraged by Craft Officers in Baker Lake, Anguhadluq also began to include mythical components in his illustrations. Some modern objects also inspired Anguhadluq in his later artistic career, such as bedsprings. Anguhadluq's style has been described as abbreviated, with simplified images and a prudent use of line. He would also often use multiple perspectives and/or repeat his subjects for graphic effects.
Historian Cynthia Cook has described Anguhadluq's work as having two distinct periods: the early period between 1960–1969 and the later period between 1970–1982. The early illustrations were often done in felt-tip pen and a limited range of coloured pencils. They most often depicted small figures, made of rugged and perturbed lines, surrounded by a vast expanse of blank paper. Later drawings used graphite and coloured pencil on handmade paper to show often larger figures, more balanced on the page than in previous works. Anguhadluq also began to use colour for visual appeal, organization of the subject and to connote symbolic value to the figures in his works. He also began to incorporate multiple perspectives during this period, which centred around a central point or figure in order to illustrate complicated events and to express his own lived experiences of time and space.
Exhibitions.
Anguhadluq's work has been featured in over 94 national and international exhibitions between 1970 and 1996, including 6 exhibitions exclusively showing his works. Two of Anguhadluq's most notable exhibitions include a joint production with his wife, Marion Tuu'luq, in 1976 and a solo exhibition put together by the Art Gallery of Ontario and held at the National Art Gallery of Canada from 1993 to 1995.
Collections.
Works by Luke Anguhadluq are at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre (Kingston, ON), Canadian Guild of Crafts Quebec (Montréal, QC), Canadian Museum of History (Hull, QC), Klamer Family Collection, Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto, ON), Victoria and Albert Museum (London, UK), Edmonton Art Gallery (Edmonton, AB), the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, ON), Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec (Québec, QC) and the Museum of Anthropology, University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC) among others.
There are works by Luke Anguhadluk at commercial galleries including Feheley Fine Arts in Toronto, ON., and Spirit Wrestler Gallery in Vancouver, BC.
Awards.
Anguhadluq was presented with a cultural award to attend the shared exhibition with his wife, which was held at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. He has also been featured in the magazine Inuit Art Quarterly many times and is regarded as an important Canadian artist. Anguhadluq's work is known to be held in the collections of at least 25 galleries and museums around the world.

Landaulet (carriage)

A landaulet or landaulette carriage is a cut-down (coupé) version of a landau horse-drawn carriage. The landaulette retains the rear half of the landau's two-part folding top.
The earliest use of the word shown in the "Oxford English Dictionary" is in a patent of 1771, using the former spelling landawlet.
A variant of the brougham called a "brougham-landaulette" had a top collapsible from the rear doors backward.
The name landaulette was also used for the landaulet car body style, where the passengers are covered by a removable top and the chauffeur is usually covered and separated from passengers by a division.

Loretta Pettway

Loretta Pettway (born 1942) is an American artist and quilt maker of the Gee's Bend Collective from Boykin, Alabama. Her quilts are known for their bold and improvisational style.
In 2006 her quilts "Roman Stripes" variation and Medallion appeared on two US Postal service stamps as part of a series commemorating Gee's bend quilters. Her quilts are in the collections of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. She is a recipient of a 2015 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.
Life.
Pettway was born in Boykin, Alabama and grew up in disjointed homes with laborious chores and responsibilities. Her mother left the family when Loretta was about seven years old. Her father, Famous Pettway, remarried Plummer T. Pettway, but Loretta was raised primarily by her grandmother, Prissy. She was also the primary caretaker of her disabled brother. Pettway spend some of her childhood under her Aunt Candis and Uncle Tank Pettway's roof. There she grew up alongside her cousins Qunnie Pettway and Tank Jr. Later, she moved to another aunt's house, Missouri Pettway, alongside her cousin, Arlonzia Pettway.
Her schooling was also fragmentary. Pettway typically went to school during October, November, and December, between harvests. Otherwise, all of the rest of her time was spent harvesting and attending to her brother.
She married an abusive man who drank, smoked, and was very jealous. She raised seven children, who also began farming at an early age.
Work.
Pettway is one of the only quilters interviewed by the Souls Grown Deep Foundation who expressed contempt for learning to quilt. She recalls, "I didn't like to sew. Didn't want to do it. I had a handicapped brother and I had to struggle. I had a lot of work to do." However, her grandmother Prissy was adamant about her learning to quilt, insisting that it was a skill that would be useful later in her life. This proved true when Pettway moved into her home, which only had one heated room, as an adult. "But when I got me a house, a raggly old house, then I needed them to keep warm. We only had heat in the living room, and when you go out of that room you need cover. I had to get up about four, five o'clock, and get coal. Make a fire. Them quilts done keep you warm."
She first learned how to quilt by assisting her grandmother with assembling patches, threading needles, etc. Her first quilt was a "Nine Patch" quilt made when she was eleven. As an adult, she has a variety of patterns in her oeuvre.
Examples of Pettway's work include: Lazy Gal Bars quilt, Housetop quilt, and Medallion quilt that can be found at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Palazzo Canigiani, Florence

The Palazzo Canigiani, initially built as "Palazzo Bardi-Larioni", and later also known as "Canigiani-Guigni" is a Neoclassic-style palace located in Via de' Bardi 28 in the quartiere of Santo Spirito in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy.
History.
Part of the site was once occupied by the Palazzo Larioni de' Bardi, and the ancient hospital of the Church of Santa Lucia dei Magnoli. From various buildings, a larger domicile had been constructed by 1283. At this early palace was born Eletta de' Canigiani, the mother of Petrarch. In 1465, the bankrupt Bardi sold the palace to the Canigiani. Between 1819 and 1838, Tommaso Giugni, who had married the last heir of the Canigiani, refurbished the structure, both the interiors and facade, in a neoclassical style. That reconstruction included the destruction of a 17th-century fresco depicting an encounter between Saints Dominic and Francis that occurred in the hospital. However, there is no historical documentation of this encounter.
In the hospital in 1994, the British art historian Sir John Pope-Hennessy died at this site.

Ain't Got No Home (Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry song)

"Ain't Got No Home" is a song written and originally recorded by American rhythm-and-blues singer and pianist Clarence "Frogman" Henry. It was released as a single in the United States on December 15, 1956.
The first verse of the song is sung in a man's voice, the second in a falsetto and the third in a frog's voice.
In the United States, the song reached no. 3 on one of the "Billboard" R&amp;B charts and no. 20 on the "Billboard" pop chart, the Top 100.
History.
Clarence Henry used his trademark croak to improvise the song "Ain't Got No Home" one night in 1955. Chess Records' A&amp;R man Paul Gayten heard the song, and had Henry record it in Cosimo Matassa's studio in September 1956. Initially promoted by local DJ Poppa Stoppa, the song eventually rose to number 3 on the national R&amp;B chart and number 20 on the US pop chart. The gimmick earned Henry his nickname of "Frogman" and jump-started a career that endures to this day.
The song was the first big hit released on the Chess subsidiary Argo Records.
Accolades.
The song is ranked no. 98 on the "NME" magazine's list of "100 Best Songs of the 1950s".

515th Coast Artillery (United States)

The 515th Coast Artillery was a regiment of the United States Army first created in the early 1920s.
It was allotted to the Seventh Corps Area in 1923, and organized in 1924 as part of the Organized Reserves. After the outbreak of the Pacific War on 7 December 1941, a "Provisional 200th CA (AA) Regiment of Manila" was established on 8 December 1941, initially with 20 officers and 500 enlisted men manning anti-aircraft weapons previously stored in the Manila area. The 515th Coast Artillery was then withdrawn 19 December 1941 from the Organized Reserves and allotted to the Regular Army, and the 515th Coast Artillery (Antiaircraft) hastily activated at Fort Stotsenburg near Manila in the Philippine Islands, with the provisional regiment's personnel from the 200th Coast Artillery (AA). The number "515" was taken from an Organized Reserve regiment in Lincoln, Nebraska, organized in 1924, that probably had few personnel assigned. That day the provisional regiment was redesignated as the 515th and augmented with about 750 officers and enlisted men of the Philippine Army for training. It was moved from Manila on 25 December 1941 (the day before Manila was declared an open city) to defend the withdrawal routes to Bataan, where the unit defended the Cabcaben airfield and other key points until surrendering as part of the Philippine Provisional Coast Artillery Brigade on 9 April 1942.
The 515th Coast Artillery (Antiaircraft) was inactivated on 2 April 1946 at Fort Mills, Philippine Islands. The regiment was redesignated on 1 August 1946 as the 515th Coast Artillery Battery and activated at Fort Winfield Scott, California. Inactivated 25 November 1946 at Fort Winfield Scott, California. Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 515th Antiaircraft Artillery Group, organized and federally recognized on 25 September 1947 at Roswell, New Mexico, moved to Albuquerque in 1955, but then consolidated with a number of other units into the reformed 200th Artillery on 1 September 1959. 
The 515th Support Battalion within the New Mexico Army National Guard now is the heir to the lineage of the 515th CA.

My Perfect You

My Perfect You is a 2018 Philippine romantic comedy drama film directed by Cathy Garcia-Molina, produced and distributed by Star Cinema. Starring Gerald Anderson and Pia Wurtzbach. This is Pia Wurtzbach's second film after "", which was released theatrically on December 25, 2017. The story is about Burn (Gerald Anderson), a man who's down in the dumps, and Abi (Pia Wurtzbach), the girl who helps him see the light again. The film was released on March 14, 2018.
Plot.
Burn Toledo (Gerald Anderson) loses control of his life after his marriage proposal is rejected by his girlfriend Angel (Marlann Flores) and is fired from his job. He drives away to a far place and crashes his car. He ends up in Happy Sunshine Camp, a remote resort, where he meets the owner, Abi (Pia Wurtzbach). He instantly forms a dislike towards her due to her perky demeanour as all-around worker in the remote resort. Burn soon apologizes for his rash and awful behaviour and with the help of Bubut (Wilma Doesnt), Handres (Janus Del Prado) and Lucky (Darwin Tolentino), helps restore the resort to its former shape as payment for his debt. He begins to form a bond with Abi as he spends more time with her.
In reality, Burn is revealed to have developed schizophrenia after sustaining head injuries due to the accident. He is treated by his doctor and friend Aris (RJ Ledesma) who informed Burn's father Roel (Tonton Gutierrez) and his older sister Ellaine (Dimples Romana) about his condition. Roel angrily refuses to treat his son's illness since his wife died with the same illness. Burn has psychotic episodes towards his father when he angrily attempts to snap him out into reality, indicating that Abi, the Happy Sunshine Camp, and the people in it are imaginary.
During the re-opening of Happy Sunshine Camp, Burn finally faces the reality that Abi, her friends, and the people whom they called their first visitors in the remote resort are imaginary. In the real world, he is rescued by Ellaine as he was drowning in the bathtub the whole time. Burn's mental condition continues to worsen, convincing Roel to have Aris treat his son's mental illness. As Burn is being treated, his memories of Abi and her friends at the hospital begins to fade. Burn finally says goodbye to Abi, and they part ways. Burn recovers from his mental illness after six months of treatment and reunites with his family.
One day while spending time with his family, including Tetet (Xia Vigor), Ellaine tells him to meet a certain person at a coffee shop. On the way, Burn sees two other people who look like the same people he met at the Happy Sunshine Camp. At the coffee shop, meets the barista Bie, who happens to look exactly like Abi. Since Burn's memory of Abi has been erased, he doesn't remember her but looks familiar to him. Burn finally introduces himself to Bie and he smiles, happy to meet her in person.
Production.
On January 18, 2018, Star Cinema announced that Pia Wurtzbach is set to do a new film with Gerald Anderson after her successful MMFF film "" with Vice Ganda and Daniel Padilla. It was announced Thursday shortly after a story conference where the lead stars were in attendance. The film will be helmed by box-office director Cathy Garcia-Molina.
The filming started on January 25, 2018. Anderson and Wurtzbach were spotted in Kidz Pool Resort at Sitio Coto, Masinloc, Zambales where the film was taken.
On March 2, 2018, Star Cinema finally released the official theatrical trailer and poster of "My Perfect You".
Release.
"My Perfect You" premiered in Philippine cinemas on March 14, 2018. Released in 200 Cinemas earning 10 million on its opening day. It is also released on some selected countries.
Critical response.
Oggs Cruz of Rappler stated "Director Cathy Garcia-Molina is currently the Philippines' foremost crafter of escapist fantasies.
She, however, doesn't peddle her works as portraits of possible realities. She's aware that her stories are diversions to the drastically harsher lives of her film's audience, populating her perfect love stories with women who are obviously wearing outrageous wigs, seemingly in an effort to highlight the fact that nothing in the films' fairy tale endings can be farther from the truth.
"My Perfect You" appears to be the strangest in Garcia-Molina's filmography, even stranger than My Only Ü (2008), which had the characters played by Vhong Navarro and Toni Gonzaga commit to a romance even in the afterlife.
What makes "My Perfect You" stand out is how it isn't exactly a love story but an examination of Burn, played excellently by Gerald Anderson, a man desperate for an escape from the many problems that ail his life. The film opens with him running away from his family, hurriedly driving to an unknown destination until he swerves into a ravine trying to avoid hitting a pedestrian who suddenly appears in the middle of the road. He gets out of his damaged car and finds himself in a decrepit resort managed by overeager and endlessly optimistic Abi, played by surprisingly soulful Miss Universe winner-turned-actress Pia Wurtzbach."

Cosmo Gang the Puzzle

 is a 1992 falling tile puzzle arcade game developed and published by Namco worldwide. The third game in its "Cosmo Gang series", succeeding that year's "Cosmo Gang the Video", players stack groups of blocks and aliens known as Jammers in a vertical-oriented well. The objective is to clear as many objects on the screen before they reach the top of the screen. Blocks are cleared by aligning them into complete horizontal rows, while Jammers are cleared by defeating them with blue-colored spheres.
Namco ported the game to the Super Famicom a year later in 1993. This version of the game was reworked and reskinned as "Pac-Attack" for North America and Europe, which was later ported to other consoles such as the Sega Genesis and Game Boy. "Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" was met with a mixed reception from critics, being praised for its multiplayer aspect and gameplay but criticized for its graphics. The Super Famicom version was released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008 and Wii U Virtual Console in 2015, while the arcade version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2009 — all of these ports were exclusive to Japan.
Gameplay.
"Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" is a falling tile puzzle game in the vein of games such as "Tetris" (1984) and "Puyo Puyo" (1990). The objective is to drop down formations of descending blocks and pink-colored aliens named "Jammers" in a vertical-oriented playfield. Blocks are cleared by matching them into complete horizontal rows of six. Jammers cannot be cleared by aligning them in rows, and are instead cleared by placing a blue-colored sphere on top of or near them, which will defeat any Jammers in its path and disappear when stuck in a spot with no Jammers left. The arrow shown on the sphere indicates the direction it moves. Defeating Jammers fills a portion of a meter situated at the center of the screen; when filled, a star drops from the top of the puzzle well that clears all Jammers beneath it. The game ends once the objects reach the top of the screen.
Alongside a single-player option, a multiplayer option is also available. The second player's screen will replace the Jammers with white-colored robots named 'Pipopapo-Tai", which behave the same as regular Jammers. In the multiplayer mode, the objective is to fill up the other player's screen, which can be accomplished by clearing more Jammers than the other player, causing the other's enemies to fall onto the opponent's side. The game will end once a player's blocks and Jammers reach the top.
Development.
The development of "Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" began shortly after the completion of its predecessor, "Cosmo Gang the Video" (1992). Its production team shared many of the same members, including its director Koji Miki and several graphic artists. The decision to make the third "Cosmo Gang" game a puzzle game instead of a shoot 'em up was based on the success of other falling tile puzzlers, namely "Tetris" and its sequel "Hatris" (1990). Puzzle games had proven to be popular and lucrative for arcades and home video game consoles due to their simplicity and room for innovation, so the development team thought this would make "The Puzzle" easy to market.
"Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" entered production in mid-1992 and was developed on a tight schedule. "The Video" possessed a lengthy development process and required a lot of energy and time from its staff, so "The Puzzle" was designed to be more simplistic in comparison. To save time, the graphics were recycled and altered from those in "The Video". One of the graphic artists had difficulty designing the sprites as they wanted to keep the cutesy look of the "Cosmo Gang" characters while still being confined to a 16x16 pixel space. Though the team designed it to be easy for beginners, Namco executives made the team increase the difficulty to make it more appropriate for arcades. The soundtrack was composed by Mie Arakawa, who wanted it to retain the wacky and comical nature of the series.
Release.
Namco released "Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" in November 1992, running on the Namco NA-1 arcade system. A home port for the Super Famicom began development shortly after and was published on February 26, 1993. The development team took the game's difficulty and strategies into account for the home version and chose to include a "Genius Book", which detailed different strategies and methods that players could use for the game. Namco considered releasing this version overseas but didn't believe it would sell well as the Cosmo Gang characters were not popular outside Japan. Namco Hometek suggested retooling "The Puzzle" into a "Pac-Man" game, resulting in the release of "Pac-Attack" (1993).
Two versions of "Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" were produced for Japanese mobile phones; one was released for i-Mode in 2005 and the other for Yahoo! Keitai in 2007. The Super Famicom version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2008, followed by the arcade version in 2009. A second retooling of "The Puzzle" that replaced the characters with those from "Katamari Damacy", titled "Korogashi Puzzle Katamari Damacy", was released in 2009 for DSiWare. The Super Famicom version was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015.
Reception.
"Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" was only a moderate success in arcades. It was awarded the 16th Annual Hit Game award from "Gamest" based on reader vote. A writer for "Sinclair User" enjoyed the game for its addictive quality and mechanics. They wrote that while it wasn't an original concept by any means, "Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" was still an enjoyable game in its own right, and made for a solid take on the "Tetris" formula.
For the Super Famicom version, reviewers often complained the gameplay wasn't as gratifying or well-designed as other puzzle games available. The four reviewers of "Famitsu" felt that it lacked the same level of refinement as "Puyo Puyo" or the simplicity of "Tetris". Andy Lowe from "GamesMaster" stated that while he felt "Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" possessed more "involved" gameplay than "Tetris", it lacked substance and didn't have as many features that other similar games had. "Super Play"s Matt Bielby disliked the difficulty for being too easy and the gameplay for becoming tedious after a while, writing that its quirkiness couldn't save it from becoming "cupboard-fodder". Andy and Bielby both found the price too expensive for a game that offered little in the way of content.
Critics showed appreciation towards "Cosmo Gang the Puzzle" for its novelty and some of its concepts. Lowe said that the game had a wider scope than other "Tetris" clone games did, and that it "features some devilishly strategic touches" that other titles lacked. Biebly agreed and said that what little depth that "Cosmo Gang" had was very innovative, finding some of Namco's additions to be creative. Writers for both "Famitsu" and "Super Famicom Magazine" liked the multiple gamemodes for offering a different take on the falling tile gameplay. "Famitsu" staff in particular were fond of the Vs. Mode for its more relaxing pace, writing that it was a necessity for games of its kind. Lowe and Bielby both enjoyed the puzzle mode for its layer of strategy and depth; Lowe in particular believed that it was the best aspect of the game. The game's graphics, character animations, and soundtrack also received praise. "Super Famicom Magazine" concluded their review by writing that "Puzzle" made for a nice addition to the console's library, and outclassed the arcade original with its new features.

Cultural archive

Cultural archive is a term associated with social anthropologist Wendy James referencing the repository of knowledge found in everyday interactions that individuals reference to validate their existence in the world. This term was coined during James' research of the Uduk people of Sudan. 
The term is most commonly associated with Culture and Imperialism, the 1993 collection of essays by postcolonial theorist Edward Said. The term first appears in reference to Rudyard Kipling's Kim and Said suggests the cultural archive is a major site where investments in imperial conquest are developed. These archives include "narratives, histories, and travel tales." Said emphasizes the role of the Western imperial project in the disruption of cultural archives, and theorizes that disciplines such as comparative literature, English, and anthropology can be directly linked to the concept of empire. 
Gloria Wekker's 2016 book "White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race" utilizes a scavenger methodology by "work[ing] with interviews, watching TV and reading novels, analyzing email correspondence..." in order to develop a clear understanding of the Dutch cultural archive.

Punta Filetto Lighthouse

Punta Filetto Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located on the Isola Santa Maria, which makes part of the Maddalena archipelago, on the northern point of the island facing Barrettinelli di Fuori Lighthouse from which it is away. The island is in the municipality of La Maddalena on the Tyrrhenian Sea.
Description.
The lighthouse was built in 1913 and consists of a masonry quadrangular tower, high, with balcony and lantern atop a 2-storey keeper's house.

The lighthouse is completely automated, powered by a solar unit and managed by the Marina Militare with the identification code number 1004 E.F.
In the 1956–57 school year, after many request from the inhabitants of the islands of Razzoli, Santa Maria and Spargi, a popular school was established for the children of the lighthouse keepers and the shepherds who lived there. The school was hosted inside the lighthouse and the lessons, held by the teacher Masia, started only on January 9, 1957, due to a lack of means.
In 1972 the lighthouse was abandoned by the keepers because it was automated, the building began to fall in ruin and the Arcipelago di La Maddalena National Park restored it in 2006; however the structure was covered with a scaffolding as shown in the image taken in 2009 and so it is still left.

Kenjivideos scandal

The "Kenjivideos" scandal is a political scandal that occurred in Peru in 2018 as part of the currently ongoing political crisis. It followed the release of videos filmed by Congressman Moisés Mamani showing opposition congressmen offering construction projects and special access to the presidency to help President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski avoid impeachment; this resulted in the resignation of Kuczynski.
The videos received the name of “Kenjivideos” because of the involvement of Congressman Kenji Fujimori and other members of his political party. The name is similar to the "Vladi-videos" scandal of 2000 when Vladimiro Montesinos was filmed bribing an opposition congressman to support Alberto Fujimori's government.
Background.
"Pro-vacancy" and "anti-vacancy" supporters stole voters. According to the main video, the dissident block of Kenji Fujimori was seeking to persuade congressmen to vote against the vacancy.
Discovery.
At the beginning of 2018, complaints came from both sides over vote-buying. On March 20 Popular Force congressman Moises Mamani showed a collection of videos in which the aforementioned individuals were shown trying to bribe him. Hours later, a congresswoman from the same party, María Melgarejo from the Department of Ancash, revealed that they tried to bribe her in the same way, on behalf of a congress member of the dissident bloc.
The main media actor, Kenji Fujimori, justified the actions of his colleagues, stating "What has been seen (in the keikovideos) is a management conduct done by any authority".
Giuffra case.
One day after the videos were released, two audiotapes were published, on which the then head of the Ministry of Transport and Communications Bruno Giuffra can be heard using the tactics seen in the videos. Although Fujimori does not appear in these recordings, he became embroiled in the Mamani scandal.

Eastern Kentucky University.
2018-19
On March 23, 2018, A.W. Hamilton was announced as the 21st Head Coach at Eastern Kentucky University. Hamilton established his brand quickly, “Most Exciting 40 Minutes in Sports,” or the modern day “40 Minutes of Hell.” A.W. took the Colonel program to a new level very quickly, in his home opener he broke a decade long attendance record in a game vs his alma mater Marshall University with a fan attendance of 5,189. Hamilton's first collegiate win came on November 10, 2018 at UT-Chattanooga behind Nick Mayo's 40 point performance to top the Moc's 81–78. Hamilton's brand, “Most Exciting 40 Minutes in Sports” became a national headline when his team scored an Ohio Valley Conference record 87 points in a half, and an EKU record 145 points in a game on December 29, 2018 vs Brescia College. It only took A.W. Hamilton 14 games to shatter this record. On February 16, 2018, Hamilton shattered his own attendance record in their game vs Murray State with 5,640 fans. In his first year at charge, Hamilton's “Most Exciting 40 Minutes in Sports” gained national attention. His team ranked 2nd according to KenPom in the NCAA Division I in Tempo/Pace, Forced Turnovers (18.2), Steals Per Game (10.2), and 13th in Scoring. EKU averaged 82.7 Points Per Game during the 2018-19 Campaign, the most points averaged by a Colonel team since 1987. "Most Exciting 40 Minutes in Sports" helped create new records for EKU in his first season in charge.
2019-20
In his second season A.W. Hamilton raised the bar another level in Richmond. Sophomore guard, Jomaru Brown, scored 41 points vs Western Kentucky University on November 15, 2018 setting an Alumni Coliseum record for most points scored by an EKU player. Hamilton's Colonels jumped out to a 9–2 start in OVC play, the best start since 1978-79 (41 years) by an EKU team; during the stretch the Colonels won 6 straight games, the most consecutive wins in conference since the 2007 season. The Colonels would finish up conference play 12-6 and secure a 4th seed in the OVC tournament, the first tournament appearance since 2014, and would make it all the way to the semi-finals. Hamilton installed a fast-paced offense and pressure defense that saw the Colonels rank 5th in the NCAA Division I in Forced Turnovers (18.3), 7th in Steals Per Game (9.3) and 10th in Turnover Margin (+4.3) in the 2019–2020 season. Because of his continued success at EKU, Hamilton was named OVC Coach of the Year by his peers and National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District 18 Coach of the Year, the first coach at Eastern Kentucky University to win this award. 
In the year 2020, EKU led all NCAA Division I programs in the state of Kentucky for most wins. The Colonels had 21 wins during 2020, followed by: WKU (20), Murray St. (20), UL (19), UK (17), NKU (17), Bellarmine (13), Morehead St. (11) 
2020-21
COVID-19 pandemic may have slowed down the majority of the country but it sure didn't slow down Hamilton's Colonels. They started off the 2020–21 season hot with a 6-1 non-conference record, the highest non-conference winning percentage since 1948-49 (72 years). After 16 games into the season the Colonels had tallied 14 wins and only 2 losses, the best start since 1946-47 (74 years), including a 7–1 start in OVC play, the best start to conference play since 1964-65 (56 years). The record books at EKU would continue to be rewritten by Hamilton during the season. His team tied an OVC Record and set an EKU record when they drained 20 3-pointers vs UT-Martin on January 21, 2021, scoring 113 points in their 113–73 win, which is the most points vs an OVC opponent since 1988 (33 years). But the “Most Exciting 40 Minutes in Sports” wasn't done there, Hamilton broke another EKU record when he tallied 15 Ohio Valley Conference wins (2 more wins than the previous record), when the Colonels downed Belmont on February 25, 2021. Belmont was ranked #27 by the AP Poll and #2 in the Mid-Major Poll, the win also put Belmont's 30 game OVC winning streak to a halt. The 2020-21 Colonels behind Hamilton's lead broke records upon records during the year. Their 22–7 record will go down as the highest winning percentage since the 1964–65 season (56 years ago), 22 wins marks the 3rd most in program history and only the 11th time in program history hitting the 20 win mark. It was the first time since the 1979 season EKU finished with single digit losses. The 76% winning percentage ranked first amongst all Division 1 programs in the State of Kentucky (Morehead 74%, WKU 72%, Louisville 65%, Bellarmine 64%, NKU 56%, Murray State 50% and Kentucky 36%). EKU ranked as high as #12 in the Mid Major top 25. Hamilton was named a finalist for the Hugh Durham Award given to the top Mid-Major Coach in College Basketball.

1896 United States presidential election in South Dakota

The 1896 United States presidential election in South Dakota took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Voters chose four electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
South Dakota was won by the Populist nominees, former U.S. Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Arthur Sewall of Maine. Two electors cast their Vice Presidential ballots for Thomas E. Watson.
Bryan won the state by a very narrow margin of 0.22 percentage points, becoming the first national Democratic presidential candidate to win the state. Bryan would later lose the state to Republican incumbent president William McKinley four years later and would later lose the state again to William Howard Taft in 1908. As of the 2020 United States presidential election, this is the only time that a Republican candidate has won the presidency without carrying South Dakota.

Water supply and sanitation in Azerbaijan

National Policy Dialogues on Integrated Water Resources Management in Azerbaijan for managing water resources are aimed at developing a state strategy based on "Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes” of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and European Union Water Framework Directive and the “Water and Health” Protocol of that convention as well as other principles of the United Nations and the EU.
Documents, directives and other acts of the EU, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the United Nations Environment Programme, the Global Water Partnership, as well as other international organizations were used in the preparation of strategy. It was taken into account most international water legislation requirements.
History.
In the late 80's and early there was a serious problem in the water supply system in Azerbaijan. After the gaining of independence, the main task of government was to eliminate the difficulties in the water supply system as well as in many areas of the economy. First of all, the establishment of an organization that could improve the drinking water supply of residential settlements in Baku, Sumgayit and Absheron peninsula began. So, the Absheron Regional Joint Stock Water Company was created in 1995, under the decision of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan based on the main and circulating assets of the two former state-owned enterprises - "Kommunsenayesutehjizaty" Production Association and "AzSuGEO" Scientific-Research Institute.
At that period of time, for the first time among the CIS, a loan was granted to the water sector by international financial institutions for the "Greater Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project" and this project was successfully implemented.
Drinking water supply.
In 2004, the repartition of water resources in Azerbaijan is as follow: 30% rivers, 40% lakes, 20% reservoirs and the rest between springs and groundwater. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in 2008 7% of the consumed water in Azerbaidjan was coming from underground sources.
Mingachevir reservoir of the Kura river is used as a source of drinking water by the population.
Reservoirs.
Mingachevir reservoir.
This Mingachevir water reservoir was created on the Kura river. The construction of the Mingachevir reservoir and the Hydroelectric Power Station was completed in 1953. The total capacity of the reservoir at the normal level (83 m) is 15730 mln m3, useful volume of it is 8210 mln m3. The area of the reservoir is 605 km2, the volume is 16.1 km3, the length is 70 km, the maximum width is 18 km, the average depth is 26 m, the deepest is 75 m.
Jeyranbatan reservoir.
Jeyranbatan water reservoir was established in 1955 due to increasing demand for drinking and technical water in Baku and Sumgayit. The capacity of the reservoir is 186 million m3, the useful volume is 150 mln m3. The length of the reservoir is 8.74 km, the maximum width is 2.15 km, the length of the coastline is 23.3 km, the maximum depth is 28.5 meters.
Sanitation.
In the sewerage sector, Baku wastewater network serves 72% population of the city, but only 50% of the water is treated. 90% of the treated water is biologically processed and only 10% is mechanically processed. Wastewater treatment plants are available in 16 cities and regions; most of them are partially or completely useless. In most cases, the quality of water supplied to the population does not meet the required standards. The state works with donor communities to take the necessary measures to address these problems. The Azerbaijani government has adopted a program on the construction of water supply and sewage systems in more than 60 small towns (regional centers) in the country. The state has already started to implement more than 20 such projects. At the same time, local water supply projects are being implemented.
"Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project".
The Loan agreement between the Government of Azerbaijan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency on the "Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project " was signed on 29 May 2009 and entered into force on 30 June 2009.

Lucius Neratius Proculus

Lucius Neratius Proculus was a Roman senator, who held several posts in the emperor's service. He was suffect consul in either the year 144 or 145. Proculus is known primarily from inscriptions.
He is a member of the gens Neratia, whose origins were in Saepinum. Although he bears the praenomen Lucius, the same as Lucius Neratius Marcellus (suffect consul in 95 and ordinary consul in 129) and Lucius Neratius Priscus (suffect consul in 97), Proculus is the son of a Gaius Neratius. Proculus is also known to have a sister, Neratia Procilla, who married one Gaius Betitius Pietas, a notable of Aeclanum; their son and Proculus' nephew was Gaius Neratius Proculus Betitius Pius Maximillianus.
Life.
His "cursus honorum" is known from a dedication to a statue raised by his fellow citizens at Saepium. The earliest office Proculus is attested as holding was in the "decemviri stlitibus judicandis", one of the four boards that formed the "vigintiviri"; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. He served two commissions as military tribune: first with Legio VII Gemina then stationed at Legio (modern León); next with Legio VIII Augusta in Argentorate (modern Strasbourg), in Germania Superior. His next recorded office was quaestor, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Proculus would be enrolled in the Senate. The traditional Roman republican magistracies of aedile and praetor followed, without distinction.
His first praetorian post was as "legatus legionis" or commander of Legio XVI Flavia Firma, then stationed at Samosata in Commagene; Géza Alföldy dates his commission to around the year 138. As Proculus was close to Syria, he was ordered to lead "vexillationes" against the Parthians; Mireille Corbier dates this military campaign to 139 or shortly thereafter. This show of force impressed Vologases III, who provisionally renounced his designs on Armenia. 
On his return, Proculus was appointed as prefect of the "aerarium militare", which lead him directly to the consulate. As prefect he may have been either the colleague or successor of Salvius Julianus. Corbier notes that if Proculus were Julianus' colleague, his ascent through the senatorial ranks would have been rapid, and Proculus would have been consul in 144; if Proculus succeeded Julianus, his advancement was slower and he would have been consul in 148.
The life of Neratius Proculus is a blank after his consulate.

Charles Edwards (Liberal politician)

Charles Edwards (1825 – 22 February 1889) was a British Liberal Party politician.
Edwards inherited the Dolserau Hall estate in 1858. He was a Justice of the peace of Merionethshire, and the High Sheriff in 1871.
Political career.
Edwards was elected MP for Windsor at a by-election in 1866—caused by Henry Hoare and Henry Labouchère being unseated when the 1865 general election was declared void on petition, due to bribery via election agents—and held the seat until 1868 when he did not seek re-election. 
In 1879, he stood as the Liberal Party candidate in the 1879 Canterbury by-election. He lost narrowly to the Conservative candidate. After the election, it emerged that Edwards had spent about £140 () on buying votes during the campaign. Although Edwards disclaimed knowledge of this and blamed his campaign manager, he did admit that the money was spent on bribery and he had personally repaid the amount to his manager.
In 1880, he stood again in Canterbury in the general election, and again narrowly lost the seat.

To accommodate indigenes of the region in diaspora, the group has also established presence in United Kingdom, United States and Germany.
The association also cautioned president Muhammadu Buhari and the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) of witch-hunting former Niger Delta Freedom Fighter, Hight Chief Oweizide Government Ekpemupolo alias Tompolo, Dr. Patrick Ziakede Akpoboloukemi, former director general Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency(NIMASA) and other Niger Delta prominent leaders saying “Witch hunting of our leaders is fight against us. We shall not take it from him anymore. He is disrupting the sleeping lions. No one has the monopoly of violence.”
In April 2017, the President of the association, Comrade Victor James, met on a closed door meeting with the British Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton &amp; Devonport, Oliver Colvile, where he presented papers on "Degradation and deprivation in the Niger Delta titled "Act now before it is too late". The meeting with the conservative MP was in view of the corruption attached to the Ogoni clean-up and other related Niger Delta oil spills, following report from the spokesperson for the group, Comrade Gaberiel Patterson. The President accused the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari of politicizing the issue of clean-up process of the region even after a celebrated fanfare that saw no inclusion of the activity in the 2016 and 2017 budget. He also called for "stabilisation clauses" by International Oil Companies (IOC) in Host Government Agreement (HGA) to minimise the political risks associated with their projects as he accused the Federal Government and the region's elders of political insincerity. "Yes, I repeat, I trust nobody within the current politics of Nigeria. Our politicians in Niger Delta and federal government are having a side deal with the IOC and pretending as if they care for the common man in Niger Delta".
In 2018, the group spoke against the modus operandi of British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC, in Nigeria which it alleged was designed to favour the North. In a statement released by the group’s president, he claimed this alleged trend was not unassociated with the fact the BBC seldom reports any event that would paint the Niger Delta in good light to stimulate the necessary capacity with a view to ameliorate the myriads problems springing up in the Niger Delta region. The youth leader argued that the coverage on economic, infrastructural, political and social welfare inadequacies in the North, particularly the Fulani/Hausa core North by BBC to the extent it established BBC-Hausa Language spoke volumes of its alleged bias and lack of consideration for other regions. It should however be noted that BBC has since launched services for both Yoruba and Igbo languages to cater for all three popular languages in the African country.

Hemus (publishing house)

Hemus (Bulgarian: "", written in pre-1945 Bulgarian alphabet with the letter "Ъ": "Хемусъ" or Haemus) is a Bulgarian publishing house. It was first founded as a joint-stock company in 1918 in the Kingdom of Bulgaria (Tsardom of Bulgaria), in Sofia, by General Credit Company and few members of the Democratic Party.
History.
1918–1947.
Hemus grew up as the most significant Bulgarian publishing house at that time (especially after the bankruptcy of "Alexander Paskalev &amp; Co Publishing" (1908–1921), bankrupted due to the major spelling reform in the Bulgarian language in 1921). By the end of its activity in 1948, it has registered a stable publishing activity and financial profit. During 1921–1930 the company had held the third place of the publishing business in Bulgaria. During 1931–1944 its business had fallen to the fifth place.
In the initial phase of its existence, Hemus publishing house had published mainly foreign authors (1918–1920 – 62% of the production).
In 1921–1930, Hemus ranked third among the Bulgarian publishing houses with its 129 foreign titles. 1931–1944 stood at fifth place mostly by publishing children's literature. At that time the Bulgarian authors prevailed in the publishing policy of Hemus. Its business has been orientated towards the children's and youth audiences turned out to be favorable for the publishing house. The carefully selected titles, their low price and the well-developed distribution network generated the success of Hemus. The publishing house was strictly following the state requirements and standards at that time. This encouraged a good market for the children's book in the post-war situation, unemployment and reduced demand.
The rising revenues and the stabilization of the Bulgarian economy after the end of the First World War led the editor Hristo Hadzhiev to prominent authors, to the best foreign literature translators, which were attracted by correct business and financial relations.
Shoemaker Award (1932).
In 1932, Hemus publishing house was awarded with the "Shoemaker" Prize during the Second International Book Exhibition in Brussels for G. Atanasov's illustrations of the book "Maiden Unborn" by Ran Bosilek.
1947–1989.
In 1947, Hemus publishing house was nationalized by the totalitarian communist regime under the Private Industrial and Mining Enterprises Nationalization Act. Under this law there were nationalized all of the 169 publishing companies in Bulgaria (64 of them in Sofia). This was done within the framework of the forced nationalization, imposed by the Bulgarian Communist Party's leading government and in the line with the policy pursued by the Bulgarian Communist Party, which led to totalitarian rule till 10 November 1989.
According to Ordinance 3428 of 9 July 1948 on the liquidation of private book publishing issued by the Chairman of the Committee for Science, Art and Culture, promulgated in State Gazette, issue 161 dated 12 July 1948, in force since 12 July 1948, all private publishers had to delete "Publishing" or "Publisher" from their companies’ names and undertake to request the closure of their company affairs.
The premises in which the private publishers have been carrying out their previous activities and their inventory and facilities were placed under the direction of the Science, Arts and Culture Committee, respectively the liquidator.
Gancho Rashkov was appointed as Liquidator. The lawyer Boris Apostolov assisted the Union of Book Publishers.
The book publishing houses Slavcho Atanasov with its "Golden beans library", MLG Smirkarov – "World Authors library", "United household magazines",'"Hemus", "Biser" and "Kazanlak valley", should transmit their premises in which they have exercised their current activity, together with the whole property – inventory, equipment, available materials, books, etc. to the State Publishing House "Science and Art", respectively to the liquidator, according to the Ordinance, explicitly indicated.
1991–2005.
In 1991, Hemus Publishing LLC was established in the Sofia City Court to continue the publishing tradition and the trademark Hemus.
The private company was co-established by B. K. &amp; Milde, Germany – 23.52%; Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science – 11.76%; Ministry of Culture – 5.88% and the Ministry of Economy – 58.82%.
For 15 years Hemus published around 200 titles.
2016 – to present.
Hemus is now an imprint of Alegzander Publishing, Sofia.

Diuris heberlei

Diuris heberlei, commonly called Heberle's donkey orchid, is a species of orchid which is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has three to five linear leaves at its base and up to four bright yellow flowers with a reddish brown border around the labellum callus. It is found along the south coast and is one of the last "Diuris" to flower in Western Australia.
Description.
"Diuris heberlei" is a tuberous, perennial herb with between three and five linear leaves at its base, each leaf long and wide. Up to five bright yellow flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, narrow egg-shaped with a tapered tip, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to sword-shaped, greenish brown, long, wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are more or less erect or turned backwards, spread apart from each other, long and wide on a brownish or blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is broadly egg-shaped, wide with a low ridge with brown markings near its base. The side lobes are egg-shaped, long and wide. There are two ridge-like calli about long near the mid-line of the base of the labellum and bordered with reddish brown. Flowering occurs between late December and February.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris heberlei" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Nannarup, east of Albany, and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Review". The specific epithet ("heberlei"), honours Ron Heberle, orchidologist and discoverer of this species .
Distribution and habitat.
Heberle's donkey orchid grows in winter-wet areas between sand dunes between Albany and Augusta in the Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions.
Conservation.
"Diuris heberlei" is classified as "Priority Two" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.

Lympstone Manor, Exmouth

Lympstone Manor (formerly Courtlands House) in Exmouth, England, is a building of historical significance and is Grade II listed on the English Heritage Register. It was mainly built in the 1760s around an older building which had been used as a farmhouse. At this time the owner was Charles Baring, a wealthy banker who had just been married. It was the residence of many notable people for the next two centuries. Today it is a hotel, restaurant and vineyard.
Early residents.
Charles Baring (1741-1829) was born in 1741 in Larkbeare House in Exmouth. His father was John Baring, a wealthy merchant. Charles entered the banking business with his brothers Francis and John who foundered the famous Baring Bank. In 1767 he married Margaret Gould (1743-1803), who was the daughter and heiress of William Drake Gould of Lew Trenchard Manor. It is about this time that Courtlands House was transformed by Charles from a farmhouse to a mansion. The couple had nine children, seven daughters and two sons.
Margaret died in 1803 at Courtlands House. There is a memorial to her in Lympstone Church which survives today. Soon after this Charles sold Courtlands House to Lambert Blair. He died in 1815 and the house was sold to Sir Walter Roberts.
Sir Walter Roberts 2nd Baronet (1776-1828) was born in 1776. His father was Sir Thomas Roberts 1st Baronet of Glassenbury, Kent. He inherited his father’s property in 1817. He died in 1828 and the house was sold. The advertisement for the sale described it as follows.
""A freehold estate consisting of a mansion house of handsome elevation called Courtlands with lawn, pleasure ground, garden, shrubberies and stables, coach house, graperies, hothouses, greenhouse and all other suitable offices and buildings."
The next owner was William Francis Spicer (1763-1853), who previously owned Weare House. His father was William Spicer, a Member of Parliament. He died in 1853 and as he had no living children the property was inherited by Richard Heaviside, his great nephew who changed his name to Richard William Spicer in accordance with the Will.
Richard seems to have rented the house to wealthy tenants for some time. The 1861 Census records John Wood, a landed proprietor and his wife Harriet as the occupants.
Later occupants.
The Browne family had purchased the property by 1862. Octavius Browne (1809-1876) was born in 1809 in London. His father was William Loder Browne. His brother was Hablot Knight Browne who became famous for his illustrations of Charles Dickens novels. In 1843 he married Martha Swete Cummins in Brixton and the couple lived there for several years. In 1847 he took his family to Australia to seek his fortune. He became quite wealthy and built a house in St Kilda, Melbourne. He became part of the social set which included the famous diarist Georgiana McCrae. She painted a portrait of him which is shown here
He sold his house in Melbourne and returned to England in 1854. He lived in Badgworth Gloucestershire for some time and then in about 1862 he purchased Courtlands House. He died in 1876 and his wife Martha continued to live at the house. She is shown in the 1881 Census as living there with her three unmarried daughters and seven servants. She sold the house in about 1886 to William Lethbridge.
William Lethbridge (1825-1901) was a barrister and very wealthy shareholder. He was born in 1825 into fairly moderate circumstances but acquired a large fortune. His father died when he was young and the family were forced to leave their farm which was called Wood House in Exeter. He was academically brilliant and obtained a scholarship to the University of Cambridge and later became a barrister.
One of his University friends asked him to join his family business W. H. Smith which was the enormous newspaper and bookselling firm. He did very well here and moved into the upper classes. He became the friend of the Canadian High Commissioner Sir Alexander Galt who persuaded him to invest in the Canadian North Western Coal and Navigation Company which made huge profits.
In 1886 when he bought Courtlands House he was an extremely wealthy man. He did not marry but he lived there with his sister Mary Marshall Lethbridge. When he died in 1901 Mary inherited the house but she sold it shortly after to Mrs Mary Bridget Johnston, a wealthy widow.
Mary Bridget Johnston (1840-1908) was the widow of Thomas Johnson of Broomsleigh, Kent. She was born in 1840 in West Malling, Kent. Her father was Edward Thomas Luck, a landowner. In 1861 she married Thomas Johnson but the couple had no children. When she died in 1908 Courtlands House was inherited by her cousin General Sir George Luck. He did not live there but appears to have rented it to wealthy tenants. The first one was the Thornycroft family.
Charles Edward Thornycroft (1849-1927) and his wife Edith remained there until 1920. They are recorded in the 1911 Census as living there with their unmarried daughter Ruth and eight servants. After them Commander Henry William Allen Adams (1884-1862) and his new bride Charlotte were the residents of Courtland House. Both of them had been married before. Charlotte was the daughter of George Coats, 1st Baron Glentanar. She married first William Lionel Charles Walrond but he died in 1915. She then married Commander Adams in 1920. The couple remained at Courtlands until about 1923 when Sir Thomas Garbutt Knott became the owner.
Sir Thomas Garbutt Knott (1879-1949) was the owner of the house for the next 25 years. He was born in 1879 in Tynemouth, Northumberland. His father was Sir James Knott the famous shipping magnate who set up the Prince Line in 1895. Thomas married in 1907 an American divorcee Sarah Elizabeth Fowler but marriage did not last and they were divorced in 1924. He served in World War 1 by joining the New Zealand forces. Both of his brothers were killed in the War. He lived at Courtlands House until his death in 1949.

Harlem Park

Harlem Park was an amusement park and Chautauqua site in Rockford, Illinois that operated from 1891 to 1928. It was located on 47 wooded acres (0.2 km2) east of Harlem Blvd. on the west bank of the Rock River on Rockford's north side. The main entrance was located between Harper and Brown Avenues.
Rides.
Harlem Park was known for its roller coaster, "The Famous Switchback Railway - Cars Run 1100 Feet In 26 Seconds". The park also featured: Steam Merry Go Around (later Electric Carousel), Three Way Figure Eight Scenic Railway, Shoot the Chutes, Giant Flying Circle Swing, Maze, The Old Mill (Tunnel of Love), Laughing Gallery Fun House, boat rentals, picnic grounds, a 5000-seat auditorium, a dance pavilion, a roller skating palace, a swimming pool (1922), and the midway bordered on both sides with such attractions as the ice cream parlor, lunch room, games of skill, and the rides.
Chautauqua.
Beginning in 1902, the Assembly of the Rockford Chautauqua met at Harlem Park for two weeks each summer, with attendance of over 80,000 annually. Participants could rent tents and stay overnight on site, enjoying educational and entertainment programs during the day and evening. Lecturers included William Jennings Bryan, "Fighting Bob" La Follette and Jane Addams.
Transportation.
The Rockford Street Railway Company developed Harlem Park as a terminus for its streetcar line serving the north side of the city. A car barn stood near the park between Harlem Blvd. and Clinton Street on the south side of Brown Ave. During the summer, cars departed every 15 minutes from the center of town, bound for the park. The park was also served by two steamboats running two miles upstream from the center of town and by an electric ferry bringing park patrons across the river. 
Demise.
At the close of the 1928 summer season the park was closed, and some of the attractions were moved to Central Park (1921-1942) on the west edge of the city. In preparation for a residential subdivision, a 2,000-foot seawall was built on the river bank and the land behind it was built up by as much as six feet with material dredged from the river. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought the project to a standstill and it was 1948 before the first home was built in the Rock Terrace subdivision.

ISO-IR-197

ISO-IR-197 (known by the ISO-IR registration number of its GR set) is an 8-bit, single-byte character encoding which was designed for the Sámi languages. It is a modification of ISO 8859-1, replacing certain punctuation and symbol characters with additional letters used in certain Sámi orthographies.
ISO-IR-197 was proposed for establishment as a part of ISO/IEC 8859 in 1996 (as part 14 and, later, part 15), but was not accepted for this. However, ISO-IR-197 is referenced in an informative ISO/IEC 8859 annex, which lists it as an encoding which provides a more adequate coverage of the orthography of certain Sámi languages such as Skolt Sámi than ISO-8859-4 or ISO-8859-10, unless the latter is combined with ISO-IR-158.
Windows extension.
As documented by Evertype, some Windows implementations use a variant which adds graphical characters to the C1 area (0x80-9F), including some of the other characters from the Mac OS Sámi repertoire. This was intended to be analogous to the Windows version of Latin-1 (i.e. Windows-1252), and follows its layout where possible.
ISO-IR-209.
ISO-IR-209 is an update that replaced the guillemets at 0xAB and 0xBB with the letter H with caron to add Finnish Romani support.

Liam Ridley

Liam Ridley (real name Jack Lowden) is a fictional character from The CW's 2017 series "Dynasty", a reboot of the 1980s prime time soap opera of the same name. Portrayed by Adam Huber, Liam is the first series regular role in the remake not based on a character from the original series. Liam first appears in the 2018 episode "Our Turn Now", in which he meets and agrees to marry Atlanta energy heiress Fallon Carrington (Elizabeth Gillies) to thwart the plans of tech billionaire Jeff Colby (Sam Adegoke) to ruin her. After recurring in seasons one and two, Huber was promoted to a series regular for the third season. The character has been a fan favorite since his very first appearance.
Characterization.
Huber called Liam "just a good guy". He attributed his character's popularity to Liam's function as the straight man in contrast to the heightened melodrama of the Carringtons, adding that fans love Liam's chemistry with Fallon, portrayed by Gillies. He said that "Liam keeps Fallon accountable," and noted:
Lizzy Buczak of "TV Fanatic" wrote that "the Van Kirks get worse with each family additional family member. I can see why Liam decided he was better off changing his name and becoming estranged." Liam explains to Fallon in "The Butler Did It" that he allows his mother Laura Van Kirk (Sharon Lawrence) to berate him because he is protective of her, Laura having suffered a mental breakdown after the death of Liam's father. Buczak was disappointed with Liam's "timid reaction" upon learning in "New Lady in Town" that Fallon's treacherous brother Adam Carrington (Sam Underwood) slept with his mother, and wrote "I was hoping to see Liam throw a few much-deserved punches". Huber said he wants Adam to pay for what he has done to Liam and Fallon, but noted "I don't know if Liam's the type of who's going to really go after him".
Development.
Buczak called Liam's relationship with Fallon "tumultuous yet epic". Andrea Reiher of "Brit + Co" noted that their business arrangement took on a hint of romance in "Don't Con a Con Artist". Huber explained:
Though the show had hinted that Liam could actually be Fallon's long-lost brother Adam, Delia Harrington of "Den of Geek" called the reveal of Liam's backstory as the disgruntled heir of another wealthy family "a bit of a letdown after all the hinting", and "all too straightforward." Georgia Makitalo of "Hidden Remote" called Liam's admission in "Dead Scratch" that he is in love with Fallon a "shocking revelation".
Paul Dailly of "TV Fanatic" called the love triangle of Fallon, Liam, and Michael Culhane (Robert Christopher Riley) "one of the most engrossing love triangles on TV in quite some time", adding that "both Liam and Culhane are genuinely nice men who care for Fallon [and] her dream about the three-way in the shower confirmed that Fallon was conflicted." Samantha Nguyen of "MyFantasySportsTalk" noted that though the love triangle seemed settled by Fallon and Michael's engagement in "Twenty-Three Skidoo", the series had "made it pretty clear that there's more drama to come". Asserting that Fallon and Michael's chemistry had dissipated in season two in favor of Liam, Buczak also pointed out, "Fallon is more conflicted than ever regarding her feelings for Liam and Culhane. Fallon still had lingering feelings for Liam. However, she probably would have been able to curb those emotions had she not assumed Culhane was having an affair."
Huber researched amnesia for his third season storyline. Though that plot development was a surprise, he noted, "It gives me something to play with." Saying that he wanted Liam and Fallon to ultimately be together, Huber acknowledged that "you have to have the drama because of the type of show it is. Without it, it's just kind of 'meh'." He said, "You can never be too happy or too sad for too long on this show...It's always going to be kind of a rocky road for [Fallon and Liam], though, and in this TV show it's never going to be rainbows and balloons, there are gonna be things that try to complicate their relationship." Huber said of Fallon and Liam, "They're cut from the same cloth. I think they truly understand and get each other, and make each other happy. But they really are soulmates, so I'm hoping that's what the writers think." He noted:
Huber added, "I want the relationship on the show to be a positive relationship. You know, the younger generation is watching it. I want them to support each other and be there for one another. Not like have this crazy drama and crazy fighting because not all relationships are like that." Of future storylines, he said that he hopes he will be able to do more physical action and stunts in future episodes, and that the show will have Liam reconnect with the child he gave up.
Appearances.
Huber first appeared in the 2018 episode "Our Turn Now", in which Liam meets and marries Atlanta energy heiress Fallon Carrington to thwart tech billionaire Jeff Colby's plot against her. He recurred on "Dynasty" for the first two seasons, never sure how long he would be kept around. It was announced in October 2019 that Huber had been promoted to a series regular for season three. He said that being put on contract with the show was unexpected, and that he was testing for a role on an upcoming "NYPD Blue" reboot when the offer was made during filming of season two. Huber said, "people really love our chemistry and me as a love interest on the show, so I think that's why it stuck." Liam is the first series regular role in the remake not based on a character from the original series, and the character is Huber's first series regular role.
Storylines.
Season one.
In "Our Turn Now", Fallon sets up Liam as Sam's date to her faux wedding to Jeff. Sam and Liam hit it off, making Fallon's brother Steven jealous. Liam eventually admits that he is not gay, and encourages Sam to seek out Steven. Turning the tables on the Colbys, Fallon announces to Jeff that their new marriage is invalid since she met and married Liam the night before at city hall. Though their annulment is in the works, Liam agrees to attend Fallon's grandfather's funeral with her in "Poor Little Rich Girl". He is recognized by someone as "Jack", but dismisses it as a mistake to Fallon. After he helps her try to manipulate a confession out of her mother Alexis in "Don't Con a Con Artist", Liam and Fallon kiss. Fallon agrees to a date with him in "Use or Be Used", but misses it when she learns that her ex-boyfriend Michael's father is in the hospital. Alexis reveals to Fallon that Liam is really a journalist named Jack Lowden writing a tell-all, and Fallon cuts him loose. Liam gives Alexis his manuscript—actually about his own wealthy family—for delivery to Fallon, but Alexis burns it instead. Liam appears at Steven and Sam's wedding in "Dead Scratch", and tells Fallon he is in love with her. He reveals that his manuscript was about his own family, the Van Kirks of New York.
Season two.
In "Twenty-Three Skidoo", Fallon is negotiating to sell Carrington Atlantic to Liam's uncle Max Van Kirk, but she and Liam have to pretend to still be married to secure the deal. Max coerces Fallon and Liam to kiss in front of him, which leaves Fallon slightly confused about her feelings. Liam introduces Fallon to his imperious mother, Laura, in "The Butler Did It", and Fallon faces off with her in Liam's defense. Suspecting Michael is cheating on her, Fallon almost has sex with Liam in "Queen of Cups". Liam gives Fallon an ultimatum about their relationship in "That Witch", and she ultimately chooses Michael over Liam. In "A Champagne Mood", Fallon and Michael go to Liam for his help in accessing Van Kirk files, which they hope will prove that Max was behind the drug smuggling and keep Michael out of jail. Although reluctant at first, Liam agrees to help. After Fallon breaks things off with Michael because she cannot trust him, she visits Liam, but another woman answers the door. In "The Sight of You", Fallon takes a girls trip with Monica, Cristal, and stowaway Kirby, but her true motive is to see Liam, who is at the same ski resort in Idaho with his new girlfriend Ashley. While Sam and the women sabotage Ashley, Fallon asks Liam for another chance. He is happy with Ashley, and asks Fallon to move on as well. After Ashley and her friends brawl with Fallon and her posse at a dive bar, a furious Liam tells Fallon he never wants to see her again. In "Miserably Ungrateful Men", Fallon buys the publishing company that is releasing Liam's novel, intending to scrap the book but trying to manipulate him into pulling out of the deal on his own. In "How Two-Faced Can You Get", Fallon reads and loves Liam's novel, which is about their relationship. She goes to him to apologize, and offers to publish it after all. In "Life is a Masquerade Party", Fallon arranges for Liam and his ex, Ashley, to spend time together in public to promote his book, but is jealous when they appear to be rekindling their relationship. Fallon and Liam admit they are in love with each other. Fallon's brother Adam takes a photo of Fallon and Liam kissing, which he sells to the press. The negative publicity surrounding the photo threatens Liam's book sales in "This Illness of Mine", forcing Fallon to confirm publicly that the book is about her and not Ashley. Liam's mother Laura appears and threatens to block the novel's publication unless Fallon breaks things off with Liam. He tries to broker a peace over dinner. Laura claims to be dying of cancer, but Fallon is suspicious. Fallon has Laura's blood tested and proves she is lying, but Laura deflects the accusation and Liam is angry with Fallon. Laura is eventually forced to confess, and Liam softens to Fallon. In "New Lady in Town", Fallon and Liam plot to expose Adam's true colors to her father Blake, but Adam outmaneuvers them each time. While Fallon steps in for Blake to prevent Jeff and Michael from seizing control of the Atlantix in "Thicker Than Money", Liam and Kirby help her snatch a book deal from a competitor. Liam and Fallon finally have sex. Liam, hit over the head by Adam, falls face down into the pool in "Deception, Jealousy, and Lies".
Season three.
In "Guilt Trip to Alaska", Liam has been rescued but lies in a coma. Adam tries to kill Liam in the hospital, but is interrupted by Fallon. Ashley arrives, and when Liam wakes up, he does not remember Fallon. She pulls out all the stops to get Liam to remember her in "Caution Never Won a War", but his mother Laura does her best to thwart Fallon's efforts, including filing a restraining order against Fallon. Learning that Liam is marrying Ashley, Fallon attempts to restore Liam's memory in "Something Desperate" by having him read his original manuscript that details their relationship. He reads it and does not marry Ashley, but tells Fallon he still does not remember her, and wants to be on his own. Just as Fallon moves on from Liam with Evan in "Mother? I'm at La Mirage", Liam begins to remember their past together. He asks her to dinner, hoping to recover more memories, in "A Used Up Memory". Not wanting Liam to remember what Adam did to him, Adam arranges for Evan to see Fallon with Liam. A possessive Evan warns Liam to keep away from Fallon. Liam's memories return, and he and Fallon reunite. In "Shoot from the Hip", Fallon is worried that Liam will forget her again, and he is angry to discover she lied to him to keep him close. Fallon gives Liam free rein in writing an article about Blake's murder trial for her magazine in "The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial", but when he includes her own less-than-flattering courtroom performance, she trashes her own office and erases the article. Fallon realizes that Adam's sight has returned, and Liam remembers that it was Adam who hit him over the head. In the vineyard's barn, they struggle at the edge of the loft door. In "The Caviar, I Trust, Is Not Burned", Adam saves Liam from falling but then falls himself. Liam and Fallon fight and then reconcile when Fallon begins making life decisions without consulting him in "Battle Lines".
Reception.
Buczak noted that Liam has been a fan favorite since his very first appearance. Virginia Mendes of "Ecos" said that though Liam is a character original to the new series, he has "made such a huge impact in the present audience".

Susan Stinsmuehlen-Amend

Susan Stinsmuehlen-Amend (born 1948) is a glass and mixed media artist who lives and works in Ojai, California.
Biography.
Born in Baltimore, MD, Stinsmuehlen-Amend was educated at Hood College, Indiana University at Bloomington, and the University of Texas at Austin. She studied painting and drawing before going on to run an Austin, TX architectural glass business, Renaissance Glass, starting in 1973. Stinsmuehlen-Amend studied with glass artists Narcissus Quagliata and Paul Marioni. Marioni invited her to be his assistant at Pilchuck in 1980.
Stinsmuehlen-Amend has been a guest artist and lecturer at many schools, including Penland School of Crafts, Rhode Island School of Design, Rochester Institute of Technology, Tyler School of Art, North Lands Creative Glass (Scotland), and the Pilchuck Glass School (1980-1997). In addition, she served as the first female president of the board of directors of the Glass Art Society from 1984 to 1986.
About her work.
Stinsmuehlen-Amend concentrated initially on experimental pieces that defied idealized standards of beauty, taste, form and pattern. She turned to working in glass because she felt it was more "exciting" to work with. She started creating her fragmented "X" series around 1978, in which she melded together a pastiche of colors and textures in a post-modern way. These pieces, fabricated with stained glass techniques, were meant to hang on walls, rather than as windows. As one of the few women working in studio glass at the time, her work also had feminist implications. The X was a symbol of how the artist wished to slash through the old, more staid ways of approaching glass.
She crossed between the various methods for manipulating glass and incorporated other media into her assemblage-like pieces, using scraps of everyday material to give them texture, depth, and meaning.
In the late 1990s, the structure of her work moved towards rectilinear, with diptychs and triptychs of contrasted figures and patterns. She broke her compositions down into split segments that were meant to be absorbed together despite being separated into individual panels. She integrated imagery and symbols to suggest narrative.
More recently, Stinsmuehlen-Amend sandwiches individual glass planes of images on top of one another, giving them multi-dimensionality. In these layered wall panels the viewer is meant to see into the depth of the piece but not through it, as would be the case if these panes were acting as traditional windows or screens.

Hegra (municipality)

Hegra is a former municipality in the old Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1874 until its dissolution in 1962. The municipality was located in the Stjørdalen valley. It encompassed the eastern two-thirds of the what is now the municipality of Stjørdal in Trøndelag county. The administrative centre was the village of Hegra where the Hegra Church is located.
History.
The municipality of Hegra was established on 1 January 1874 when the old municipality of Øvre Stjørdal was divided into Meråker (population: 1,861) in the east and Hegra (population: 3,409) in the west. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the neighboring municipalities of Hegra (population: 2,704), Lånke (population: 1,967), Skatval (population: 1,944), and Stjørdal (population: 6,204) were all merged to form a new, larger municipality of Stjørdal.
Government.
All municipalities in Norway, including Hegra, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. 
Municipal council.
The municipal council of Hegra was made up of 21 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:

Set of Six (TV series)

Set of Six was a British sketch comedy show, broadcast in 1990, starring Rowland Rivron as the Scrote sextuplets. The series follows each of the brothers in turn. The series was narrated by Tony Bilbow, and the music created by Steve Nieve. Rivron describes it as 'a spoof fly-on-the-wall sociological documentary looking at the way different environments affect people'.
The Scrote brothers were born out of a Rivron character, Dr Martin Scrote, who appeared on Jonathon Ross's The Last Resort. The idea for a series was drawn up on a napkin by Rivron and Ian Brown in the Gay Hussar, a Soho restaurant.
Three episodes were directed by the cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, and three by John Stroud.
Production.
The make-up was done by Dave Myers, better known as one half of The Hairy Bikers.
When shooting the David 'Top Shot' Scrote episode, Rivron met his wife-to-be who was working in the Royal Victoria Hotel he was staying at in Hastings.

Reinward

Reinward (d. 1150) was Bishop of Meissen from 1140 to 1150.
He also appears under the variants "Reinwald, Reinbert, Rembert, Reinhard, Reinwert" or "Richard". In old lists of bishops he further appears, incorrectly, as "Meinward, Meinwert, Meinhard" or "Menward" for the period 1046 to 1056 and as "Grambert, Grambor, Grambod" or "Grambrecht" for the period 1118 to 1125.
There is no information available about Reinward's family background. Before becoming bishop he was a cathedral provost in Meissen Cathedral. He also experienced the Second Crusade.
As for the length of his episcopate, older authorities such as Fabricius maintained that Reinward died on 24 July 1146 and was succeeded by a Bishop Berthold. Machatschek however found no evidence of Berthold and concluded that Reinward died in about 1150 and was directly succeeded by Albrecht I.

Benson &amp; Hedges Fashion Design Awards

Benson &amp; Hedges Fashion Design Awards was a New Zealand fashion competition that ran from 1964 to 1998. It was the country's major competitive fashion event during this period. The Awards' open entry format offered an opportunity for new fashion designers and manufacturers to showcase their work on a national platform. Prominent New Zealand fashion designers showcased their works at this event including Annie Bonza, Trish Gregory, Denise L'Estrange-Corbet and Isabelle Harris.
History.
The first awards ceremony was held on 29 July 1964 during Wellington's Majestic Cabaret. It was originally called the Wills Gold Rose Awards but became the Benson and Hedges Fashion Design Awards after a change in sponsor. Jeannie Gandar, president of the New Zealand Modelling Association, organised the first event which was hosted by Graham Kerr. The first two award categories were High Fashion Day wear and Formal Evening wear, but these categories later expanded as the event increased in size.
The awards continued to be hosted in Wellington for the duration of their existence. Josephine Brodie co-ordinated the event until 1982 when Maysie Bestall-Cohen took over the organisation. The event had been televised since its inception but in 1984 this became a live broadcast, making the event one of the largest outside broadcasts of its kind. The show however was renamed "Smokefree Fashion Design Awards" in the late 1990s after tobacco sponsorship was banned.
Award categories.
Changes in award categories marked the rise and fall of fashion trends in New Zealand as well as an increased recognition of Māori and Pacific influences on fashion design. Over the period in which the event occurred there was a notable transition away from mimicking European fashion trends to New Zealand fashion gaining its own distinctive influence and identity.
Specialist categories fluctuated with the rise and fall of certain trends in New Zealand. These included the Leather Industry Award and the Wool Growers Award.

OTI Festival 1980

The OTI Festival 1980 was the ninth edition of the OTI Festival which was held In Buenos Aires, the capital city of Argentina on November 15. This edition of the festival was held in the 1049 seat Martín Coronado room of the Teatro General San Martín which is located in the central part of the Argentine capital. The event was presented by the well known news journalists Antonio Carrizo and Liliana López Foresi. In this 9th edition of the Latin-American song contest, in which the number of participating countries reached a new record of 23 delegations, the absolute winner was the performer of Puerto Rico, the well known Rafael José, who had previously represented his country in Santiago Back in 1978. The winning song was "Contigo mujer" (With you woman).
Background.
According to the original rules of the OTI festival, the winning country of the previous year would organise the next edition, a rule that had to be removed in 1978 due to the civil war in Nicaragua, since then, the host city of the festival was decided in a draw organised by the Iberoamerican Television Organisation for the following two year. However, that original rule was re-established because of the Argentine victory of the previous edition by the bolero singer Daniel Riolobos and his song "Cuenta conmigo" (Count with me) and also because of the willingness of the participating Argentinian broadcasters: Canal 7 and Canal 13 to host and to organise the contest.
Naturally, both host broadcasters agreed, after a meeting, to host the festival in Buenos Aires.
Venue.
Canal 7 and Canal 13, the Argentine privately owned OTI full member broadcasters agreed to organise the festival in the Martin Coronado Room of the Teatro General San Martín, in downtown Buenos Aires. This theatre is one of the oldest in the capital city of Argentina. The planification of the building dates back to 1908, but the project could not go forward because of the dislike of the government. Many years later, in 1936, the project returned to prominence thanks to the intendent Mariano de Vedia y Mitre. Anyway, the project and its concession was paralysed again in 1943 when a coup d'état took place in Argentina.
After facing many problems, the construction of the Teatro General San Martín started and was definitively inaugurated in 1960 but started operating one year later.
Since its opening, this building has hosted many theatre related events apart from concerts and ballet shows. The popularity of this venue inside and outside Argentina is so big that nowadays it is considered one of the best cultural centres in Latin America. In fact, this room has attracted many popular performers from all the Spanish speaking world.
The Teatro General San Martín has got many rooms and the biggest one with 1049 seats was the one that was chosen as the definitive venue of this edition of the OTI Festival.
Participating countries.
After the last record of participating countries that was reached in Madrid three years before when 21 countries participated, in this IX edition of the festival the contest reaches a new record of 23 countries with their respective member broadcasters sending their delegations to Buenos Aires. There were no debuting countries, but some of the countries that had withdrawed in previous editions, made their return to the festival.
One of the most interesting facts of this edition was the return of Nicaragua. The last participation of this Central American country took place in 1977 in Madrid getting the victory with Eduardo Gonzalez and his song "Quincho Barrilete" (Quincho, the boy of the little barrel). After that, their participating broadcaster was forced to withdraw because of the tough situation in the country.
Another interesting return is Bolivia. The andean country's last participation was in the edition of 1975 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with the not very fortunate entry by Óscar Roca. Since then, the country withdrew mainly because of the disappointing places and to diplomatic problems with the neighbouring countries such as Chile. With the return of the Bolivian broadcaster to the festival, Susana Joffré was the singer who defended the Bolivian colors in the contest.
Participating performers.
It must be taken into account the participation of Carlos Mejía Godoy, a widely renowned composer famous in Latin-America and Spain who composed the song “Quincho Barrilete”, the winning song in the edition of 1977 in Madrid. The song which with he and his band Los de Palancagüina won the national selection was "La chavalita de España" (The little girl from Spain).
Another famous participant was the Spaniard Dyango, who was internally selected by RTVE to represent Spain with his song “Querer y perder” (To love and to lose) which received critical acclaim since his selection.
The most acclaimed performer in this year's edition from the very start was the Puerto Rican Eduardo José, who was selected by Telemundo in order to represent the Caribbean island. Eduardo José had already represented his country in the edition of 1978 which was held in Santiago, Chile getting for his country a more than respectable fourth place with his song “Háblame” (Talk to me).
The song that Eduardo José defended this year in the OTI Festival was entitled “Contigo Mujer” (With you woman) which was composed by the prominent Ednita Nazario, who represented Puerto Rico in the previous edition of the OTI Festival in Caracas achieving a notorious fifth place.
The Portuguese entrant in this new edition of the festival was another former Eurovision contestant, in this case Simone de Oliveira, who had previously represented Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest back in 1969. In this edition of the OTI Festival, Oliveira performed the song “A tua espera” (Your wait) which received a mild welcome.
The host contestant who represented Argentina was Luis Ordoñez, who performed the song “Dime adiós” (Say goodbye), which was one of the favourites to win again the festival.
In México, Televisa organised as usual their massively successful national final, the National OTI Contest to select their entrant to Buenos Aires. In this case, the winner was the male singer José Roberto, who represented his country with the song “Sólo te amo a ti” (You are the only one I love).
Another return to the OTI Festival was made by the Honduran delegation who selected again the performer Moisés Canelo as their representative. Canelo was the very first Honduran entrant in the OTI Festival back in 1974 in the Mexican coastal city of Acapulco getting for his country a respectable ninth place with the song “Río viejo río amigo” (Old river, friend river). In this edition of the festival, Canelo performed the song “Tú, siempre tú” (You, always you), which received a warmer welcome compared to his previous entry.
The Dominican entrant was Fausto Rey, who was selected by Telesistema11 in order to represent his country in Buenos Aires with his song “Canción de un hombre simple” (Song of a simple minded man).
Presenters.
The event was presented by the popular TV news journalists Antonio Carrizo and Liliana López Foresi. As usual both presenters gave an introductory speech highlighting the main goals of the Iberoamerican Television Organisation (OTI) as a contents exchange platform and those of the OTI Festival as a song contest. The speech, as always was given both in Spanish and Portuguese languages.
After that, the presenters gave little presentation speeches before the participating performers took the stage. After the performance round, during the voting process, the presenters contacted with the TV studios of the participating broadcasters in order to know the decision of the jurors. The judges of Argentina, were located in one of the two participating broadcaster's studios.
Running order.
As happened from the inaugural edition in Madrid in 1972 and in the following ones, the host broadcaster, in this case Canal 7 and Canal 13, in collaboration with the Iberoamerican Television Organisation (OTI) organised a draw in Buenos Aires few days before the event took place.
Chile was the country that opened the performance round with the singer Nino García and his song “Sin razón” (Without reason), which did not enjoy much popular acclaim.
Argentina, the host country, represented by Luís Ordoñez with his composition “Dime Adiós” (Say goodbye) was the third country to take the stage enjoying the support from the local audience and by the national juries.
The Spaniard, Dyango, one of the favourite ones with “Querer y perder” (To love and to lose) was the thirteenth performer who appeared on stage in Buenos Aires with received a lot of support in the betting odds.
Another favourite, Fausto Rey, who represented the Dominican Republic during the night was the 20th singer who entered the stage while the Ecuadorian female singer Jeaneth Salgado, with her song “En un instante” (In a moment) was the artist who ended the performance round.
Voting system.
The voting system followed the same dynamics of the previous years since the inaugural edition in which the national juries were contacted by telephone by the presenters. Each participating country had seven jurors. The jurors elected, each one, only their favourite song among the participating entries. The scoreboard was located in the left wall of the music hall.
The national juries of every participating country were contacted directly by telephone by the presenters from the Teatro General San Martín in order to know the decision of the jurors. The jury members of the host country, Argentina, were located in one the central studios of the two Argentine participating broadcasters.
Result.
The favourite Puerto Rican singer and the winner of this year's event was Rafael José with his song “Contigo Mujer” which got the victory with 36 points, 4 points of difference with the Spanish representative Dyango, who came second with 32 points.
Luis Ordoñez, the host contestant got the third position in the festival for Argentina with 31 points. Only one point of difference with the Spaniard contestant.
There was a tie between the Brazilian contestant, Marcia, who defended the song “Convite ao vento” and Ricardo Padilla the representative from Costa Rica with the song “El amor se va” (Love goes away). Both entries were tied in the fourth place with 29 points.
There was another tie in the seventh place between Moisés Canelo, the Honduran contestant with his song “Tú, siempre tú” and the Uruguayan performer Juca Sheppard, who sung the composition “Te lo quedé diciendo” (I was telling it to you). Both candidates got 22 points by the international juries.
Mexico, another favourite to the victory did not get the expected success and the singer José Roberto, conformed himself with the eighth place with 21 points.
For first time after 1977 more than one country ended in the last place with zero points. The performers from the Netherlands Antilles and the returning Bolivia, represented by Lituina Bay and Susana Foret respectively scored no points during the voting process.
Impact.
The Victory of the Puerto Rican performer Rafael José, who is a licensed dentist apart from a singer, was seen in his home country as another milestone in the national musical scene to the point that it is even said that the festival paralysed the country and made the audience forget the protests that took place because of a national electoral process that was overshadowed by a possible fraud. As happened five years before with Nidia Caro, the previous Puerto Rican OTI winner. Rafael José and the composer of his entry, Ednita Nazario were received by a huge crowd at his return to San Juan.
The second place of the Spaniard Dyango consolidated his already long career and also his position as one of the most important musicians in the Spanish national pop scene.
The host Contestant Luis Ordoñez had already a long career in Argentina. In fact, he debuted in 1956 and pursued, since then, a career both as a writer, a songwriter and also as a singer. His third place confirmed the strength of his career.
Other contestants such as the Dominican Fausto rey and the Nicaraguan Carlos Mejía Godoy, went on with their strong musical careers releasing more studio albums and creating music for many more singers.

List of lands protected by Theodore Roosevelt through executive action

Below is a list of lands set aside as national parks, reserves, or other conservatories by President Theodore Roosevelt via executive order or proclamation. During his presidency, Roosevelt issued nearly 10 times more executive orders than his predecessor. Many lands started out as preserves, but were expanded by later presidents and made into national forests.
A cornerstone of his actions focused on the issue of conservation, and Roosevelt set aside more national parks and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined. At the time, Roosevelt's executive action was controversial, and many of his actions were brought before a court.
As early as 1892, in his book "The Wilderness Hunter", Theodore Roosevelt was calling for the state to take command of wilderness lands.

Marián Kočner

Marian Kočner (born 17 May 1963) is a Slovak businessman and convicted criminal. With business dealings mostly in the spheres of risk investment, financial development and property, his name appeared in leaked police documents known as the "mafia lists" in 2005, of a list of people suspected of involvement in organized crime and their vehicles, for use of police patrols. Since 10 December 2019 he has been included in the global Magnitsky sanctions list.
On 27 February 2020, Kočner was sentenced to 19 years in prison for forging $75 million worth of promissory notes to siphon money from Markíza. He was acquitted by a first-degree court in a separate high-profile case related to the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova, a crime which triggered a significant political crisis in Slovakia.
Gamatex and TV Markíza.
Kočner first became known to the public through his attempt to take over TV Markíza in 1998.
TV Markíza, one of the first private television channels in Slovakia, was founded by Pavol Rusko and Sylvia Volzová in partnership with CME Media Enterprises B.V. in 1996. Initially the channel was not granted a broadcasting license, as the licensing board objected that Rusko did not disclose Volzová as a co-owner. Rusko entered into an agreement with Espé štúdio, a company owned by Siloš Pohanka, to pay 3 million DEM in exchange for help getting a broadcasting license for Markíza. When the membership of the licensing board later changed, Markíza secured a broadcasting license, and launched on 31 August 1996. However Rusko declared the agreement with Espé štúdio invalid, arguing that Markíza had acquired the license without Pohanka's help. After unsuccessful attempts at getting money from Rusko, Pohanka sold his claim to Gamatex, a company owned by Kočner, who persuaded Volzová to acknowledge the claim and began court proceedings to have the claim paid out.
In August 1998 Kočner appeared at the Markíza offices with a court order giving him control over the TV station. When negotiations with Rusko regarding the ownership dispute failed, Kočner occupied the TV station with hired private security and fired the TV channel's top managers. The move sparked public protests, coming only 10 days before parliamentary elections; at that time TV Markíza was the main news outlet opposing the government of Vladimír Mečiar, and the attempted takeover was seen as an attack on press freedom. Several thousand protesters gathered in front of Markíza's offices to oppose the takeover, and several opposition politicians spoke at the rally. After two days, Kočner and his associates left the building, and the ownership dispute continued in court. According to news reports, Kočner's involvement in TV Markíza seemed to end in 2000 when Rusko bought Gamatex through intermediaries.
In a 2006 interview with "aktualne.sk" (not to be confused with "aktuality.sk") Kočner said the security firm involved in the takeover of Markíza belonged to Peter Čongrády, a local mafia boss. However, in later interviews he denied hiring Čongrády.
In June 2016 Kočner's company "Správa a inkaso zmeniek" initiated court proceedings against Rusko and Markíza to collect money owed to him under four promissory notes amounting to around €69 million. Kočner claimed that Rusko had issued the promissory notes in June 2000 with Markíza providing endorsement for the notes. At the time Rusko was the executive director of TV Markíza as well as one of its shareholders. Two of those notes amounted to €8.3 million each with a maturity date in 2015 and another two were signed as "blank cheques" in the amount of €26 million with a maturity date in 2016 added later. Rusko acknowledged Kočner's claim in court and declared that the promissory notes were intended to resolve the ownership dispute with Gamatex. Markíza's management was unaware of the existence of the promissory notes. They were not recorded in either company's accounting and were not discovered during the preparation of the due diligence report when CME became the sole shareholder in TV Markíza. In April 2018 a court declared Kočner's claim as valid. However, in retaliation TV Markíza filed a criminal complaint against Kočner and Rusko for forging the promissory notes. In addition, an investigation into possible tax evasion began as, by not disclosing possession of the promissory notes to tax authorities, Kočner's companies avoided paying tax on interest on the notes.
In June 2018, Kočner was detained by the Slovak authorities in the case of the promissory notes forgery together with Pavol Rusko, as well as for various tax-related crimes. On 27 February 2020, Kocner was sentenced to 19 years of jail for forging $75 million worth of promissory notes to siphon money from Markiza.
Murder of Ján Kuciak.
Kočner's business practices were a prominent topic of articles by Ján Kuciak, an investigative journalist from "Aktuality.sk", who was murdered in February 2018 along with his fiancée, Martina Kusnirova. A couple of months prior to Kuciak's death, Kočner allegedly threatened in a phone call to "dig up dirt" on Kuciak, saying "I will focus especially on you, your mother, your father, on your siblings". Kuciak filed a criminal complaint but a subsequent police investigation concluded that Kočner's alleged statements did not constitute a criminal offence. After Kuciak's murder, general prosecutor Jaromír Čižnár ordered the case to be reopened. However police again closed the case concluding that Kočner's statements did not constitute a criminal offence. "Aktuality.sk" subsequently published a transcript of the phone call between Kuciak and Kočner.
On 4 October 2018, Kočner was named by entrepreneur Zoltán Andruskó as the person who ordered Kuciak's death. Andruskó had been taken into custody on 30 September for his part in the murder, and was co-operating with police. On 8 March 2019 Kočner was charged with having ordered Kuciak's murder.
The trial of Marián Kočner and three other defendants, including Alena Zsuzsová, the mother of his goddaughter, began on 13 January 2020. The 2016 murder of Peter Molnár, a businessman from Kolárovo, was included in the case. On the first day of the trial, co-defendant Miroslav Marček confessed to killing Kuciak and Kušnírová, and also admitted to killing Molnár during a violent burglary in 2016. On the second day of the trial, Andruskó testified against all four defendants. On 6 April 2020, Marček was sentenced to 23 years in prison. The prosecutor appealed against the sentence.

Soul Shadows

Soul Shadows is the sixteenth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack. It was originally released in 2016 on Carrack's own Carrack-UK label.
Carrack's former Squeeze bandmate Chris Difford co-wrote one track. The album was co-produced by Carrack and long-time associate Peter Van Hooke, who is Carrack's former Mike + The Mechanics bandmate.
"Soul Shadows" reached #25 on the UK album charts during a six-week chart stay in 2016. This makes it the highest-charting album of Carrack's solo career, including compilations.
Reception.
Lee Zimmerman of Blurt magazine claims "Soul Shadows" "reflects the UK rocker’s love for authentic American soul music ... (Carrack) sings with the kind of conviction that would make Al Green, Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett nod their heads with approval."
In a mixed-to-positive review, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine says of "Soul Shadows" that "the real human touch comes from Carrack's voice, which is as warm and easy as ever while also benefiting from the gentle assurance of an old master ... if the songs don't necessarily hook, this certainly is a mellow good time."

Charles Edwin Bentley

Charles Edwin Bentley (1859–1929) was an American dentist. He was the founder of what grew to be the largest local dental society in the world, and he was a leader in the Chicago branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
Biography.
Bentley was born and educated in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1887 he earned his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from the Chicago College of Dental Surgery. In his office was organized, in 1888, the Odontographic Society, and he was its first president. This dental organization grew to be the largest local dental society in the world. In February 1903 the Odontographic Society gave its famous clinic with three thousand members of the profession and nearly one thousand dental students in attendance. The Odontographical Society was merged into the Chicago Dental Society in 1911, and Bentley was a part of the merger committee. At the suggestion of Dr. Bentley, the Odontographic Society instituted an investigation into the condition of the mouths and teeth of the children of the schools. One year later Dr. Bentley submitted this report, and the same was published in the Dental Review of 1900. This report was the basis of future work along this line.
Bentley published extensively. Two of his most important papers were "The Application of Comparative Anatomy to Dentistry” and “Contact Points of the Medical and Dental Profession".
Bentley was chairman of the Child Welfare Exhibit on Dentistry. He long served as the secretary of Provident Hospital. He was the first president of the Equal Opportunity League of Chicago. He was a charter member of the Niagara Movement, and of the directory of the NAACP.
In 1898, Bentley married Florence Lewis, who was for some years the literary editor of the Philadelphia Press.

Arapakkam, Kanchipuram

Arapakkam is a village in the Kanchipuram district of Tamil Nadu, India. According to the 2011 census of India, it has a population of 2937.
History.
The Arapakkam inscription, dated to the fifth regnal year of the Chola ruler Rajadhiraja II (r. c. 1166–1178), states that a Chola chieftain had granted the village to a religious leader named Umapati-deva (also known as Jnana-Siva and Svamidevar). The inscription states that Umapati-deva was a native of the Dakṣina Rāḍha (present-day West Bengal), and had migrated to the southern Chola kingdom. Around this time, the Sinhala army captured the neighbouring Pandya kingdom, and then began offensives against the Chola feudatories. The Chola chieftain Edirilisola Sambuvarayan appointed Umapati-deva to offer prayers and conduct worship rituals, in order to avert this crisis. After 28 days of worship, Sambuvarayan received a letter from the Chola general Pillai Pallavarayan, informing him that the Sinhala generals Jayadratha, Lankapuri and others had retreated. Believing that Umapati-deva had divine powers, Sambuvarayan granted him the village of Alpakkam (modern Arapakkam), comprising 167 velis of land, as a tax-free endowment.

Spanish Athletics Championships

The Spanish Athletics Championships () is an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA), which serves as the Spanish national championship for the sport. It is typically held as a two-day event in the Spanish summer around late June to early August. The venue of the championships is decided on an annual basis.
The competition was first held in 1917 as a men's only competition. A separate women's began in 1931 but, following the onset of the Spanish Civil War, this was cancelled after 1935 and it was not until 1963 that women events were added alongside the men's programme. This made Spain the last large European country to provide a national championship for women in the sport and female participation in sport in general in Spain was low due to a lack of physical education, facilities and funding for women's sport. This stemmed from the policy of National Catholicism, which saw women's place as caregivers and physical feats by them as a challenge to morality.
The championships has been held every years since its inauguration with the exception of 1922 and three years during the civil war (1937, 1938, and 1939). The modern event is used for the Spanish international selection for major athletics events, including the Olympic Games, World Championships in Athletics and European Athletics Championships.
Events.
On the current programme a total of 38 individual Spanish Championship athletics events are contested, divided evenly between men and women. For each of the sexes, there are six track running events, three obstacle events, four jumps, four throws, and two relays.
A men's barra vasca competition was held up to 1963 – the event being a variation of the javelin throw, but the spear was thrown by a technique of spinning while holding it at the hip. This was banned to preserve public safety, as a result of errant throws.
In spite of the prevention of women for competing at the national championships for such a long period, the women's programme subsequently expanded in line with international developments. The first addition was a women's pentathlon in 1965 (later being replaced by the heptathlon in 1981). A women's 1500 m was added in 1969, a 3000 metres in 1974 (held until 1994), a 5000 m in 1982, then a 10,000 m in 1984. The women's 80 metres hurdles was extended to the 100 m distance in 1969 and the 400 m hurdles emerged in 1977. A women's 5000 m track walk was first featured in 1982 and extended to the full 10,000 m distance in 1990. The field events programme expanded in the 1990s, with the addition of the triple jump in 1990, pole vault in 1994, and hammer throw in 1995. Women finally achieved parity with men in the track and field programme with the addition of the steeplechase in 2001.
Spanish championships in 10K run, half marathon, marathon, 100 kilometres run, cross country running, mountain running and road walking are held separately from the main track and field championships. There is also a Spanish Athletics Club Championships for athletics clubs, which was first held in 1958 for men and 1966 for women.

Change (Charlie Puth song)

"Change" is a song recorded by American singer Charlie Puth, featuring guest vocals from American singer-songwriter James Taylor. Written by Ross Golan and its producers Puth and Johan Carlsson, it debuted during Puth's performance at March for Our Lives, and was released commercially for digital download on March 26, 2018, as the fourth single from his second studio album, "Voicenotes" (2018).
Background.
Puth first revealed the song in an interview with Zane Lowe on his Beats 1 radio show. "This song is called 'Change' and I'm actually gonna play it, they're doing March for Our Lives this Saturday downtown. I know nobody knows this song and James won't be there with me but I'm just gonna be on my piano. That's the right song [to play at the right moment] and I think people will understand when they hear it." Talking about how he got in touch with Taylor, Puth said that his friend Miles Beard set the collaboration up.
He stated on Twitter that the song is "dedicated to all of the Parkland students, any lives lost to senseless gun violence, and the world", alongside single cover, which features a dark blue backdrop. "It wasn't written for [March for Our Lives] specifically. I wrote it a year prior. I don't really know why I wrote it, but now I know why. It just happened to catch up a year late," Puth told "Women's Wear Daily". He also opened up about the song during an Instagram live chat, saying: "It's about everybody, as humans we all help each other and that song came about through collaboration. This is the most important song I ever wrote."
Taylor admired Puth in a statement, saying: "Mr. Puth and I spent an excellent afternoon at Conway Studios in Hollywood this past January. It was a delight to work with such a gifted fellow musician and I'm so excited to finally see the release of the finished piece." Puth added: "Recording with James Taylor was a dream come true. He's the reason why I write music and it was an absolute honour to work with him."
Composition.
Described as a "smooth, acoustic-guitar driven tune", the folk pop and soft rock song consists of "light pop melodies" and "a loose, stripped-back guitar arrangement". Abby Jones of "Billboard" noted that "the soft, folksy ambience of the track is reminiscent of Taylor's signature sound, made famous in the '70s — however, the lyrics are very much 2018". As the song ends, it "evolves into this homage to 1990s rock and R&amp;B, with heavy bass and rhythmic drums". Lyrically, the song urges people to change their attitudes in order to eliminate division and hatred.
Critical reception.
Scott Sterling of CBS Radio opined the two artists' "distinctive voices meshing beautifully over the warm track", writing that it is "far more reflective of classic James Taylor than anything on the current pop charts, and benefits mightily from the simple arrangement". Adreon Patterson of "Paste" complimented Taylor's ability to "create the ethereal mood the song evokes" with his "light baritone vocals", calling the song "a forgotten Taylor track from his '70s heyday".
Live performances.
On March 24, 2018, Puth premiered the song during his performance at March for Our Lives in Los Angeles. "There's such a theme of change happening," he introduced the song before performing it alone on the keyboard. "This song...you don't know it and it's totally fine. It just feels like the right song to perform right now." The live recording was later released as the official video, interspersed with footage from the event.

Black Labyrinth

Black Labyrinth is the debut solo studio album by American vocalist Jonathan Davis (best known as the frontman of nu metal band Korn). The album was released on May 25, 2018, through Sumerian Records.
The first single, "What It Is", was released on January 26, 2018 as part of the soundtrack to the movie "American Satan".
Background.
Jonathan Davis had hinted at a solo album for a number of years, first working without his bandmates in Korn when he collaborated on the "Queen of the Damned" soundtrack. Word of a full solo album began to circulate in the mid-2000s when Davis began touring and writing with his solo band, Jonathan Davis and the SFA, with whom he released two live albums, "Alone I Play" (2007) and "Live at the Union Chapel" (2011). The SFA was disbanded after the death of guitarist Shane Gibson. Over the next decade, Davis would continue to write solo material while performing with Korn, and in January 2018 announced a North American and European tour in support of a new album that would come out later in the year. That same month, he released the song "What It Is".
In March 2018, Sumerian Records revealed an official teaser for the album, which revealed the title, artwork and release date, along with snippets of each track on the album. While a full list of musicians has yet to be officially released, it has been confirmed that Ray Luzier, Wes Borland, Miles Mosley, Mike Dillon and Shenkar have all made appearances on the album.
Critical reception.
"Black Labyrinth" received generally favorable reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64 based on 5 reviews.

Bureau Lake

The Lac Bureau is a vast freshwater body of the southwestern part of the Gouin Reservoir, in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in Haute-Mauricie, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This lake extends in the cantons of Le May, Evanturel, Myrand, Achintre and Sulte. Following the erection completed in 1948 of the Gouin dam, the current shape of the "Lac Bureau" was shaped by the raising of the waters of the Gouin reservoir. The water level varies significantly, being dependent on the water management of the Gouin Dam erected in 1948.
Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second.
The route 404 serves the Oskélanéo River Valley and South Zone of South Bay of Bureau Lake. A forest road branch serves the west side of the latter bay.
The surface of Lake Bureau is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to the end of March.
Toponymy.
A map dating from 1924 has three distinct water bodies, not connected to each other, on the site of the present Lake Bureau. The gradual raising of water, caused by the creation of the Gouin Reservoir in 1948, led to the merger of the Great South Lake and the lakes of the North and East, creating a new lake entity.
This hydronym which has been official since 1935, evokes the work of life of Joseph Bureau (1837-1914). Born in L'Ancienne-Lorette, in the suburbs of Quebec City, this explorer-cartographer has greatly contributed to pushing back the frontiers of Quebec topographic knowledge by traversing it in all directions, from Labrador at Outaouais and St. Lawrence River at Hudson Bay. His services were retained in particular in 1870 to establish the best route for the construction of a railway to the Lac Saint-Jean and Mauricie.
The following year, it goes back with John Bignell the Saint-Maurice to its source, the "lake of the Male", now integrated into Gouin reservoir.
In 1872, Bureau agreed to direct the maneuver floating logs on this river. For a long time associated with the cure Labelle for the opening of territories favorable to the colonization of the north, it is interested then with the establishment of a railway since Quebec (city) as far as the Atlantic coast, then explores a large part of the Côte-Nord. Until the end of his life, Joseph Bureau remained active. Lake Bureau also bears the name Attikamek Opiskaw Sakahikan, High Lake.
The toponym "Lac Bureau" was formalized on December 18, 1986, by the [Commission de toponymie du Quebec].

A Damsel in Distress (musical)

A Damsel in Distress is a 2015 musical written by Jeremy Sams and Robert Hudson, with music and lyrics by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. A romantic comedy, the musical is based on the novel "A Damsel in Distress" by P. G. Wodehouse, the 1928 play adapted from the novel, and the 1937 musical comedy film "A Damsel in Distress" based on the novel and play. The musical ran from 30 May to 27 June 2015 at Chichester Festival Theatre.
Production.
The director and choreographer was Rob Ashford, the designer was Christopher Oram, and the musical supervisor was David Chase. The musical director was Alan Williams, the orchestrator was Bill Elliott, the lightning designer was Howard Harrison, and the sound designer was Paul Groothuis. Gabrielle Dawes and James Orange were the casting directors.
Reception.
Reviews were generally positive. "BritishTheatre.com": "Sams and Hudson have done an excellent job of adapting this work for the stage, inventing and re-inventing parts of Wodehouse’s original wheel. The dialogue is snappy and effervescent, and the tone light and supple throughout. There might be a tad too much emphasis on George’s artistic angst than is strictly necessary or properly explained, but that does not really get in the way of the roller coaster of frivolity that the duo has here penned."
"The Stage": "In an age of metamusicals from The Producers to the current Broadway hit Something Rotten, which offer their own ironic commentaries on the genre itself, A Damsel in Distress is both blissfully affectionate yet never affected as a young Broadway composer (Richard Fleeshman) and a British socialite (Summer Strallen) are set on an tangled but inevitable course towards each other in a dizzying, but always sincere, series of romantic collisions. Rob Ashford directs and choreographs an absolutely luxurious cast that includes hilarious turns from Richard Dempsey, Isla Blair and Desmond Barrit, and the brassily brilliant Sally Ann Triplett as the leading showgirl."
"The Telegraph": "While complex characterization was perhaps not one of Wodehouse’s main preoccupations (there are several sour little quips around George’s desire to create serious, incomprehensible 'art', rather than mere shallow, enjoyable 'entertainment'), both Summer Strallen as Maud and Richard Fleeshman as George bring a sparky edge to their obstacle-filled romance, while the late-blooming love between Nicholas Farrell as Lord Marshmoreton, who always wanted to marry a showgirl, and Sally Ann Triplett as the girl of his dreams, equally at home on the stage or in the pigsty, is genuinely touching."

Patagonia Park

Patagonia Park (Spanish: Parque Patagonia) is a private nature reserve operated as a public-access park in the Aysén Region of Chile.
The heart of the park is the Chacabuco Valley, a biologically important east-west valley that forms a pass over the Andes Mountains and a transition
zone between the Patagonian steppe grasslands of Argentinian Patagonia and the southern beech forests of Chilean Patagonia to the west.
Parque Patagonia is located between the Lago Jeinimeni National Reserve to the north and the Lago Cochrane National Reserve to the south.
Parque Patagnoia was created by Conservacion Patagonica, a nonprofit incorporated in California and founded in 2000 by Kris Tompkins,
to protect Patagonia's wildlands and ecosystems.
Parque Patagonia has an infrastructure of trails, campgrounds, and a visitor center.
On January 29, 2018, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and Kris Tompkins, President and CEO of Tompkins Conservation, signed
a decree creating 5 national parks, one of which is Patagonia National Park. Parque Patagonia will be gifted to the Chilean state and then combined
with Lago Jeinimeni National Reserve, Lago Cochrane National Reserve, and other additional lands to create Patagonia National Park, with a combined
area of .
History.
Originally one of the region’s largest sheep ranches, Estancia Valle Chacabuco has changed hands many times over the past century.
British explorer Lucas Bridges established the area as ranchland in 1908,
but through the efforts of the Eduardo Frei Montalva administration to redistribute wealth, the land was expropriated and divided between several local
families in 1964. The land was reclaimed once again, this time by the Augusto Pinochet administration, and then sold to Belgian
landowner Francoise de Smet in 1980.
Kris and Doug Tompkins
first visited the Chacabuco Valley in 1995. CONAF (Chile’s National Forest Corporation)
had listed the Chacabuco Valley as a top conservation priority for over 30 years.
After two decades of declining profits, in 2004, and with the help of Tompkins Conservation, Conservacion Patagonica purchased the 
Estancia Valle Chacabuco from de Smet and set about selling off livestock, taking down fences,
restoring grasslands and forests, and developing species-specific restoration programs.
As the park was re-wilded a public-access infrastructure was
built that included trails, campgrounds, lodging and employee housing.
Since acquiring the estancia, smaller land acquisitions have expanded Parque Patagonia to nearly .
Ecology.
Located in the transition zone between the arid steppe of Argentine Patagonia and
the temperate southern beech forests of Chilean Patagonia, Parque Patagonia encompasses an array
of ecosystems including Grassland, Riparian forest, and Wetland.
The dry steppe grasslands of Argentine Patagonia are characterized by minimal rainfall, cold, dry winds, and sandy soil.
The Andean Mountains block moisture from flowing west, creating this arid area region.
A number of plants have been able to adapt to this harsh environment, including shrubs like calafate, quilembay and yaoyín,
and tuft grasses like flechilla and coirón poa. These grasslands support hardy animals such as the burrowing owl, the gray fox,
tuco-tuco, mara, armadillos, various eagle and hawk species, and keystone predators like the puma.
A wide range of animals thrive in the more habitable outskirts of the desert and around ephemeral lakes formed from the Andes'
runoff, where trees and more nutritious aqueous grasses can grow.
Moving west and climbing the vertical gradient of the Andes Mountains, the park’s flora and fauna changes notably.
The landscape begins to transform into forests, which consists mostly of three species of the southern beech (Nothofagus)
genus: lenga, ñire, and coiue. Here, rainfall can be very high, generating dense forests, full of nutrients
from high leaf litter. These forests host 370 vascular plant genera, which are vital to the survival of the surrounding fauna.
Some significant mammals include the endangered huemul deer, puma,
red fox, and various species of bats. The forests of Parque Patagonia also contain a high diversity of
bird species including the Andean condor, Magellanic woodpecker, Spectacled Duck, Black-necked swan,
pygmy owl, Black-faced ibis, Chilean flamingo, Austral negrito, Southern lapwing and a range of amphibians and reptiles.
Throughout Patagonia, the guanaco,
a large camelid that is a wild relative of the llama, is the most abundant herbivore.
It feeds on 75% of all plant species in the Patagonian steppe.
The guanaco acts as a keystone species: it prevents domination of grass species, acts as a disperser and
fertilizes, and has high reproductive rates
, providing food for local carnivores, especially pumas.
Although the park lies on the eastern side of the Andes, its glacier-fed streams and rivers run toward the Pacific Ocean.
Their turquoise blue water is home to substantial populations of native fish such as Perch
(Percichthys trucha), pejerrey patagonico (Patagonina hatcheri) and puyen. Atlantic salmon, as well as brook, brown, and
rainbow trout, have been introduced to the area.
Visiting the Park.
Parque Patagonia is open October through April and only accessible by car. It is south of Coyhaique, Chile and north of Cochrane, Chile.
The closest airport is Balmaceda, Chile (BBA). A 300 km drive from Balmaceda on the Carretera Austral is necessary to reach the park. As of March 2018,
the Carretera Austral is only paved between Balmaceda and Cerro Castillo, Chile. The remaining portion of the highway to the park is unpaved.
The ranger station in Sector Jeinimeni is easily reachable by car in about 1.5 hours from the town of Chile Chico. It is a 2 to 5 day hike along the Aviles Trail to the Lodge at Valle Chacabuco.
The Lodge at Valle Chacabuco,
at the center of the park, houses the park's main tourist infrastructure, including a lodge, restaurant, visitor center and employee housing.
There are also three campgrounds in the park.

Isaiah H. Hedge

Isaiah H. Hedge (1812-1888) was a physician, businessman, abolitionist and philanthropist, who is the namesake and donor of Hedge Hall at Bates College in Maine.
Isaiah Hallett Hedge was born in Woolwich, Maine in 1812 to Edward Hedge and Martha Farnham Hedge. Hedge started a merchandising business in Wiscasset, Maine, before moving to Limerick, Maine where he married Charlotte Ayre in 1840. Hedge attended Castleton Medical College in Castleton, Vermont in from 1846 to 1848 and in 1850. Hedge moved first to Gorham, Maine in 1850, and then Hedge moved to Waukon, Iowa in 1855 for better opportunities. Dr. Hedge was a lifelong Freewill Baptist and was a supporter of abolitionism before the Civil War as a Whig and then a Republican. In Waukon he purchased a city block and constructed a home and actively practiced medicine in Waukon until 1875. Hedge also owned a drug store and medical partnership with Dr. Willard Chauncey, who married Hedge's only child, Ellen Augusta ("Nellie"), and they had three children. After 1875 Hedge traveled for his health and wintered in an orange grove in Florida. Shortly before his death, Hedge donated $5,000 to Bates College for a chemistry hall which was named in his honor.

Jane Maria Read

Jane Maria Read (October 4, 1853 – ?) was an American poet and teacher.
Early years and education.
Jane Maria Read was born in Barnstable, Massachusetts, October 4, 1853. She was the daughter of William and Susan Maritta (Austin) Read. Her father, Rev. Read, was a Baptist clergyman. She came from old colonial families on both sides, and her ancestors were among the early English pioneers. Until six years of age, her home was in Massachusetts. In 1859, her parents moved to the seacoast of Maine, where they lived till 1865, at that time returning to Massachusetts.
Her literary taste began early to be developed in her home, where she was wont to listen absorbed to the reading of history, travels, and "The Poetical Works Of Sir Walter Scott", when too young to enjoy reading them alone. During her school life, and subsequently, her love of poetry increased year by year. She studied at Newell's Private School, Wilbraham, Massachusetts; Burnett's English Classical Institute, Springfield, Waterville, Maine; and in the Coburn Classical Institute, in Waterville, Maine, for several years, though ill health compelled her to leave during the last year of her course, without graduating. Her classical instruction included art under Childe Hassam, John Joseph Enneking, Emil Carlsen, and others.
Career.
Read began to publish her poems in 1874, in various magazines and newspapers, and in 1887, she published a volume of verse entitled "Between the Centuries, and Other Poems". She contributed, among others, to the "Magazine of Poetry". Besides her poetical work, she was an artist of marked talent, and made a specialty of portraits and animal pictures in oil colors.
She taught languages, mathematics and other branches until about 1885. She also taught drawing, painting and sketching from nature in various towns of Massachusetts for fifteen years.
Personal life.
Read was a Baptist, and a woman of broad views, liberal culture and versatility. Her home was in Coldbrook Springs, Massachusetts, where her father was in charge of a church. Later, she resided in Still River, Massachusetts.
Style and themes.
Much of Read's poetry was of the introspective kind, with a strong element of the religious and the sentimental. Having been presented with a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poems, for months, it was her constant companion, the more so because the state of her health prevented her from mingling with others outside of her home. Many of the poems she read and re-read until she could easily repeat them, and all became quite familiar. These gave impulse and shaping to her native poetic tendencies. In one of them she read:
This she accepted as a great truth, and in her writing, Read looked within her own heart for the lessons reflected there from nature. A close and sympathetic observer of nature, almost every phase of it had a voice for her. Brought up in a family where she was forced to see the burdens of others, she also wrote for "burden-bearers", and sought to show the brighter side to those whose lives had difficulties. Thus, many of her poems were luminous with the calmness of her own Christian faith.

Good Feeling (Paul Carrack album)

Good Feeling is the fourteenth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack. It was originally released in 2012 on Carrack's own Carrack-UK label and peaked at #46 on the UK charts, making "Good Feeling" Carrack's highest charting solo album to that time.
Carrack originally recorded the song "From Now On" on his 1982 LP "Suburban Voodoo"; the version on "Good Feeling" is an entirely new recording.
Reception.
AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls "Good Feeling" "a bright, bouncing collection of blue-eyed soul. Perhaps the production is just a shade too clean -- it not only has a bright gloss but not a note is out of place, everybody is in the pocket -- but there's also a genuine warmth to Carrack's music, derived not just from his honeyed voice but from the precision of his seasoned backing band."

Albrecht I of Meissen

Albrecht I of Meissen (died 1 August 1152) was Bishop of Meissen from 1150 to 1152.
Life.
Albrecht I is not extensively documented. He was supposedly from a family of the Sorbian nobility. Before his elevation to the bishopric he was a cathedral provost. Otto von Freising mentions Albrecht in 1151 in connection with the dispute between Friedrich II of Berg and Herman van Horne over the office of bishop of Utrecht.
With the agreement of the Pope, the bishopric of Meissen, like that of Naumburg, was under the protection of Burggraf Conrad I of Meissen, in return for which the bishops were expected to undertake appropriate tasks from time to time. At the beginning of 1152 Conrad III entrusted Albrecht, who had the reputation of being talented at languages, with a diplomatic mission to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The bishop died either on the way to Constantinople or in the city itself.

International Specialized Hospital of Uganda

The International Specialized Hospital of Uganda (ISHU) is a public, specialized, referral tertiary care medical facility under construction in Uganda. The hospital is expected to take two years to construct. The private developers who are constructing the hospital will operate it for ten years, then turn it over to the government of Uganda, in a public-private partnership arrangement.
Location.
The facility is located off of the Kampala–Entebbe Road, in Lubowa, Wakiso District, in the Central Region, of Uganda, approximately , by road, south of Mulago National Referral Hospital, in Kampala, the largest city and capital of Uganda. The hospital would sit on approximately , of land, formerly occupied by a coffee plantation.
Overview.
The ISHU is a specialized referral, tertiary treatment, research, and teaching hospital, which is intended to treat patients travelling out of the country to seek specialized medical care. In 2017, it was estimated that Ugandan patients spent an estimated US$186 million on medical treatment abroad.
On 1 June 2017, the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, performed the groundbreaking ceremony for the hospital. The development, designed by the architectural firm of "Progetto CMR", of Milan, Italy, consists of nine buildings. These include the 260+ bed hospital, an outpatient department to handle 100 outpatients daily, housing for doctors, nurses and support staff, conference facilities, at least one hotel and a shopping centre.
The hospital is expected to cover a wide range of medical and surgical conditions, including organ transplants, neurosurgical operations, various cancers and orthopedic surgery and cardiac operations and treatments. The hospital design involves the installation of solar panels on the roofs of the buildings, to generate electricity and reduce the power purchased from the national grid. The design also involves the installation of rain-water harvesting systems, to reduce the amount of water purchased from the National Water and Sewerage Corporation.
International collaboration.
Following completion, a 10-year operation period will be accorded to the developers, in order for them to recoup their investment. Following that, the ownership of the institution will revert to the Ugandan government. The facility is expected to attract referrals from the countries of the African Great Lakes region.
In September 2018, the Daily Monitor reported that the Ugandan Cabinet had resolved to ban the use of public funds to treat government officials and politicians at foreign medical facilities, once this hospital is completed. This will save government an estimated US$7–10 million every year.
Parliamentary approval.
In March 2019, the Parliament of Uganda approved a government guarantee of US$379.7 million (USh1.3 trillion) to construct this hospital. A consortium comprising Finasi of Italy and ROKO Construction Limited of Uganda, was selected to construct the hospital. The facility will include an 80-bed cancer centre.

Freshwater (play)

Freshwater: A comedy is a play written and produced by Virginia Woolf in 1935, and the only play she wrote. Although only performed once in her lifetime, it has been translated into many languages and produced in many countries since.
History.
Virginia Woolf researched the life of her great-aunt, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, publishing her findings in an essay titled "Pattledom" (1925), and later in her introduction to her 1926 edition of Cameron's photographs. She had begun work on a play based on an episode in Cameron's life in 1923, but abandoned it. Finally it was performed on 18 January 1935 at the studio of her sister, Vanessa Bell on Fitzroy Street in 1935. Woolf directed it herself, and the cast were mainly members of the Bloomsbury Group, including Vanessa, her daughter Angelica Garnett, Virginia's husband Leonard and Duncan Grant, Angelica's father. "Freshwater" is a short three act comedy satirizing the Victorian era. It was not performed again in Woolf's lifetime. It was found among Leonard Woolf's papers after his death in 1969 and was not published till 1976, when the Hogarth Press produced an edition, edited by Lucio Ruotolo, who was living in Virginia Woolf's home, Monk's House, at the time. The edition was illustrated by Edward Gorey.
Plot.
The play is named after Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where Julia Margaret Cameron lived in a somewhat bohemian atmosphere at her home, Dimbola Lodge, surrounded by a number of artists and literary figures, including George Frederick Watts and Tennyson in the 1860s. Tennyson's nearby home, Farringford was another artistic centre. The plot revolves around the attempts by the young actress Ellen Terry to escape from her marriage to the much older Watts, partly family history, partly mocking the conventions of the Victorian times that the Bloomsbury group had fought to escape. The Camerons are set to embark for India, while both Mrs Cameron and Watts are intent on portraying Ellen in their respective media. Ellen on the other hand views a young naval lieutenant as her escape, with an offer to escape to Bloomsbury. This collapses a number of historic events into a single afternoon.
Performance.
In New York in 2009, both the 1923 and 1935 versions were combined for the first time in an Off-Broadway production to celebrate Woolf's 128th birthday, Charles Isherwood praising the wordplay. In London the play was performed in Virginia Woolf's former home, 46 Gordon Square (now part of the School of Arts, Birkbeck College) in 2012. "Freshwater" has also been performed at Monk's House in Rodmell, Sussex.
The play has been translated into French (1982), Spanish (1980) and German (2017). It was performed in Paris at the Centre Pompidou in 1982, and in Mainz, Germany in 1994. The French production was revived in New York in 1983, starring Eugène Ionesco, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Nathalie Sarraute, Joyce Mansour, Guy Dumur and Florence Delay.
Reception.
Although a slight work not intended for publication, and easily dismissed as frivolous, it has been given a larger meaning when placed in the broader context of Woolf's work and views. For beneath the comedic elements, there is an exploration of both generational change and artistic freedom. Both Cameron and Woolf fought against the class and gender dynamics of Victorianism and the play shows links to both "To the Lighthouse" and "A Room of One's Own" that would follow. Ellen's flight to Bloomsbury symbolising freedom from patriarchy.

Drum major backbend

The drum major backbend is an elaborate salute performed by drum majors in many American university marching bands. It is executed prior to college football games as one of the rituals engaging the audience's consent for the athletic contest that follows. It is distinct from the gymnastics maneuver of the same name.
Cultural significance.
Folklorist Danille Lindquist has described the drum major backbend, and the audience reaction that accompanies it in the form of cheering and applause, as part of a series of rituals associated with college football designed to seek and elicit popular consent for the staging of the athletic contest that follows.
Use.
Drum major backbends are executed by bending the body backwards to be parallel to the ground and at a low enough depth so as to touch the top of the headgear to the field, without the knees also touching. They are particularly associated with marching bands of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), but are also widely performed elsewhere.
The Ohio State University Marching Band (OSUMB) began executing a drum major backbend in the late 1950s with Lenny Hart being the first such person to do so. In 2016, OSUMB drum major Nate MacMaster described the backbend to "Rolling Stone" as the "most crucial moment" of game day. In the 1960s, the drum major of the University of Michigan Marching Band began performing a backbend, which was modified to a more elaborate backbend in 1993 by then drum major Matthew Pickus. This later version was achieved by removing the busby, thereby forcing an inversion of the spine so that the head comes into direct contact with the ground. According to the University of Michigan, Pickus began removing his busby after a fan criticized the depth of one of his previous backbends.
In addition to HBCUs, Ohio State University, and the University of Michigan, other marching bands whose drum majors perform a backbend include the University of Illinois Marching Illini, the University of Minnesota, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Iowa, Michigan State University, Indiana University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Cincinnati, and others.
OU "strut".
The drum major of the University of Oklahoma (OU) uses a highly modified backbend that involves only a partial inversion of the torso, held in place while simultaneously executing an elongated and affected fast walk across the field, known as "the strut". According to an OU drum major, up until 1984 "the strut" would be performed with a complete inversion so that the head touched the field.

Tang Dynasty (album)

Tang Dynasty (Chinese: 唐朝; pinyin: "Tángcháo"), also known as A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty (Chinese: 梦回唐朝; pinyin: "Mènghuí Tángcháo") is the eponymous debut studio album by Chinese heavy metal band Tang Dynasty, released in China in December 1991 and internationally on December 11, 1992 by Magic Stone Records. The album is lauded as the first Chinese metal album, combining heavy metal and progressive rock with traditional Chinese folk styles, poetry, and Beijing opera vocal techniques.
Background.
Tang Dynasty was officially formed in February 1989 by Americans Kaiser Kuo (guitar) and Andrew Szabo (drums), along with Beijing musicians Ding Wu (guitar) and Zhang Ju (bass). However, the Tiananmen Square Protests forced Kuo and Szabo to leave China. The band went on hiatus, and Ding Wu moved to Xinjiang for several months. In October, Ding Wu returned to Beijing, and together with Zhang Ju recruited "lightning-fast" guitarist Liu Yijun and drummer Zhao Nian. On May 1, 1990, the new lineup participated in a fundraising concert for the 1990 Asian Games, playing in front of 100,000 people at the Workers' Stadium. The success of the concert led the band to be signed by Magic Stone Records (Chinese: 魔石唱片; pinyin: "Móshí Chàngpīan"), the fledgling mainland division of Taiwan-based label Rock Records (Chinese: 滚石唱片; pinyin: "Gŭnshí Chàngpīan," lit. "Rolling Stone Records") specializing in Chinese rock acts.
Recording and release.
Recording took place in the second floor studio of the China National Radio headquarters in Xicheng, over a 44-day period, from September through October 1991. Founding guitarist Kaiser Kuo briefly returned in May to record some demos with the band, but left again for the United States before sessions formally began in order to complete graduate school. Bassist Zhang Ju had also been singing lead since Kuo's departure, but Kuo insisted that Ding Wu be designated lead vocalist instead, thereby cementing Ding's position as Tang Dynasty's frontman. According to Ding Wu, a significant portion of the songs' melodies were not established until recording was underway, although he later clarified that the band had completed most of the instrumentals before entering the studio.
The album was engineered by Wang "Lao Ge (Chinese: 老哥; lit. 'Old Brother')" Xiaobo (Chinese: 王昕波; not to be confused with writer and essayist Wang Xiaobo), who had worked on Cui Jian's "Rock 'n' Roll on the New Long March" and Black Panther's debut album. It was also the first album by a mainland Chinese band to be produced by Jia Minshu, who would go on to record other notable Beijing artists for the Magic Stone label. Jia recalled the making of "Tang Dynasty" as an intensive, around-the-clock process, and that an armed guard was stationed outside the studio as they worked. Despite having never worked with a rock band before, Jia noted the ease with which he and the band members could communicate musical ideas, which streamlined the otherwise stressful undertaking.
"Tang Dynasty" was released domestically in December 1991. Magic Stone Records spent the next year launching a massive overseas marketing campaign, securing the band a following in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. Five high-budget music videos for "A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty", "The Sun", "9/4", "Choice", and "Moon Dreams" were shot and released. As Kuo noted, "Nothing like that had ever been done for a Chinese band."
The international version was released on December 11, 1992 in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia.
Composition.
Numerous and eclectic influences can be heard on "Tang Dynasty". Frontman Ding Wu was a founding member of seminal Chinese bands Budaoweng and Black Panther, while Kaiser Kuo introduced the band to progressive rock acts such as Rush, Genesis, and King Crimson. Early on, the band strived to create music that was distinctly and authentically Chinese, even while working within a Western musical idiom. Kuo justified this approach by pointing out that in addition to being considered the pinnacle of Chinese civilization, Tang-era China - for which the band was named - was decidedly cosmopolitan and open to other cultures and ideas.
"A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty" begins with some textural Chinese instrumentation before transitioning into a powerful introduction. Ding Wu's high-pitched vocal delivery, drawing influences from Beijing Opera, can be heard on the song's bridge, which features lyrics drawn from works by poets Du Fu and Fang Gan. "The Sun" is built around a modal riff heavily reminiscent of Xinjiangnese folk music, augmented by Middle Eastern percussion and ethereal backing vocals, before going into an anthemic half-time chorus. "The Moon Hangs High" is an gentle ballad that features prominent acoustic guitar and Chinese woodwinds. These songs coexist alongside more Western-sounding heavy metal songs such as "Paradise", "Dream of the Doomsday" and "Don't Go Hiding".
Progressive elements are prevalent throughout the album. "Nine Rhythm" is named for the time signature on the song's verses, and begins with a guitar introduction in 13/8 time. The band makes heavy use of harmonic modulation, as heard on tracks such as "Choice", "Soaring Bird", and "Legend". Several tracks feature multiple guitar solos, played by both Liu Yijun and Ding Wu.
The band's cover of the Internationale was a last-minute addition by Kuo while they were recording demos in July 1991. The song had been omitted from the domestic tracklisting for political reasons, but was later included on the international version as well as on subsequent reissues.
Lyrically and thematically, the band was heavily inspired by ancient Chinese martial traditions, via classic Chinese novels such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", and wuxia films. Kuo characterized Tang China as "period of high heroics", stating that it worked well in the context of metal music. The band wrote its lyrics in a voice reminiscent of classic Chinese poetry, going as far as to incorporate actual lines from Tang-era poems. Scholar Cynthia Wong noted that the band's poetic lyricism juxtaposed with loud, aggressive musicianship was consistent with the ancient Chinese concepts of "wén" (文; intellect) and "wŭ" (武; martial ability) respectively, and how "ideal men" were expected to possess a balance of the two. The characterization of the band members as "warrior-poets" was furthered by the album cover, the accompanying music videos, and Magic Stone's press release emphasizing the "self-confidence of the Chinese".
Reception and legacy.
"Tang Dynasty" is generally cited as China's first heavy metal album. It was "an unprecedented success" upon its release. As Kaiser Kuo recalled, the album "went absolutely crazy" by 1993, despite not receiving radio play and became a bestseller in Taiwan. Total recorded sales vary from source to source, ranging from 900,000 to over 2 million legal copies, with countless other pirated versions. Liu Yijun was labeled "hands-down the best guitarist in China" by "Spin", and subsequently became China's first guitar hero. "A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty" received some minor airplay outside of China, and its accompanying music video was nominated for MTV Asia's International Viewers Choice Awards in 1993. Following Tang Dynasty’s lead, numerous Chinese metal bands, such as Overload and Tomahawk, were established, and the Chinese metal scene diverged into various subgenres as the decade progressed. Zhang Fan, president of Beijing's Midi School of Music, revealed in the 2007 documentary "Global Metal" that "80% of Chinese youth came to know metal music by listening to "Tang Dynasty.""
"Tang Dynasty" was noted for its glorification of ancient China. Author Facai Guo noted the album's successful fusion of "tradition and reality", and declared the band to be the "insurrectionist of Chinese contemporary culture”. Indeed, many saw Tang Dynasty's music as a reaction to both the polished, commercial sound of Hong Kong pop "(gangtai)", and the simple, strophic revolutionary songs pushed by the Communist Party. Critic Zai Dao praised the band, saying "They express in their own way a longing for a strong and influential China: a return to Tang Dynasty." Beijing-based journalist Stephen Schwankert, speaking of the album, observed that "Tang Dynasty produced music that looked and sounded like what Chinese people thought rock should be."
Although Tang Dynasty was slated for a follow-up release in 1995, internal problems culminating with Zhang's death in a motorcycle accident on May 11 and Liu's subsequent departure the following year put the band on an indefinite hiatus. The band's second album, "Epic", would not be released until 1998.
Tracklisting.
In late 2008, Beijing-based label Jingwen Records reissued the album, including "The Internationale" as well as a DVD containing the five music videos off the album.

John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital

The John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital was a teaching hospital on the campus of the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama, open from 1892 to 1987. It was named for abolitionist Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew (1818–1867), a main force in the creation of negro troops in the U.S.
History.
The John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital was originally established in 1892 as the Tuskegee Institute Hospital and Nurse Training School. Its original purpose was to train nursing students and provide care for faculty members at the Tuskegee Institute. When it was founded, it was the first black hospital in Alabama. When it was founded, it did not have an outpatient clinic, and instead only provided emergency services within its Tuskegee building. Unlike most other American hospitals of the day, it practiced outreach to surrounding communities through decentralized clinics in rural areas, and most patients received care at these clinics rather than at the hospital itself. In 1902, John A. Kenney Sr. was appointed its director, after which the hospital increased in size and expanded its reach to the entire surrounding community.
After being given to the Tuskegee Institute in 1911, it was dedicated on February 21, 1913, as a result of which it was renamed. It was rebuilt using money donated by the wife of Charles E. Mason, a trustee of the Tuskegee Institute. It was named after Mrs. Mason's grandfather, former Massachusetts governor John Albion Andrew. In a 1919 article in "the Nation's Health", Kinney described the hospital as "a modern, up-to-date, well-appointed, two-story brick building, with accommodations for sixty patients with no crowding, and for a good many more when it is necessary." The Tuskegee Syphilis Study took place at the hospital, thanks to the approval of both Eugene Dibble (then the hospital's medical director) and Robert R. Moton (then the president of the Tuskegee Institute).
The hospital closed in 1987, after its resources were exhausted by an excess of charity cases. When it closed, it was the last black hospital in Alabama. It was later reopened as the National Center for Bioethics in Research and Healthcare in January 1999.
Influence.
During the pre-civil rights era, John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital served as a center for black physicians in the Deep South to receive postgraduate training, and for black patients to receive care. According to Montague Cobb, it was one of only five first-rate hospitals in the pre-1940s South that treated black patients. Because so few other nearby hospitals would accept black patients, it "became the medical center for Alabama blacks", as a 1995 "Baltimore Sun" article noted.

Mark Meechan

Mark Meechan (born 19 October 1987) is a Scottish YouTuber and former UK Independence Party candidate for the European Parliament. He uses the online name Count Dankula.
Meechan received press coverage when he posted a video showing him teaching his girlfriend's dog how to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute, and to react to the phrase "Do you wanna gas the Jews?" Meechan was arrested and convicted of being "grossly offensive" under the Communications Act 2003, following a trial in March 2018. The arrest generated controversy and discussions about free speech. In April 2018, Meechan was fined £800. Meechan stated he would not pay the fine, and instead donated £800 to the Glasgow Children's Hospital Charity. In March 2019, the money was seized from his bank account by an arrestment order.
Arrest.
In April 2016, Meechan posted a video on YouTube of his girlfriend's pet pug Buddha titled "M8 Yer Dugs A Nazi". At the start of the video, he says: "My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is so I thought I would turn him into the least cute thing I could think of, which is a Nazi." In the video, the dog, prompted by the command "Sieg Heil", raises his right paw in the manner of a Nazi salute, watches a speech by Adolf Hitler (footage shown from the "Triumph of the Will"), and responds immediately when Meechan asks if he wants to "gas the Jews". It ends with images of Hitler and Buddha the dog depicted with a toothbrush moustache similar to Hitler's.
Meechan was arrested on suspicion of breaching the Communications Act 2003. On 19 March 2018, Meechan was convicted of breaching the act by Sheriff Derek O'Carroll at Airdrie Sheriff Court. The court ruled that Meechan's claim that the video was a joke intended for his girlfriend "lacked credibility" as Meechan's girlfriend did not subscribe to the YouTube channel to which the video was posted. On 23 April 2018, Meechan was sentenced to a fine of £800, with no prison sentence.
Reaction.
Approximately 500 people gathered in London to protest for free speech when the sentence was handed out. Following Meechan's conviction, British comedians Ricky Gervais and David Baddiel made comments supporting Meechan. Others who opposed the prosecution included Kenan Malik, Tim Blair, Helen Dale, Douglas Murray, Tom Walker, Shappi Khorsandi, Marc Randazza, Jonathan Turley and Stephen Fry. Index on Censorship CEO Jodie Ginsberg stated that the right to free expression must include the right to offend, "otherwise the freedom is meaningless".
Sitcom writer Graham Linehan condemned Meechan. Meechan responded by saying that Linehan's show "Father Ted" also contained Nazi-related jokes. Meechan was scrutinised for embracing support from right-wing figures Alex Jones and Tommy Robinson, to which he replied: "Imagine totally abandoning protecting human rights, just because someone you don't like is defending them too. Astounding." On 6 May 2018, Meechan spoke at the "Day for Freedom" rally, organised by Robinson, which was described as far-right by news media and observers.
David Coburn, the United Kingdom Independence Party Member of the European Parliament for Scotland, released a two-page statement condemning the ruling as "an embarrassment". Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, brought up Meechan's case in the House of Commons and said: "Can we have a debate about freedom of speech in this country – something this country has long held dear and is in danger of throwing away needlessly?"
Sheriff O'Carroll noted that there were only "very limited" submissions from the defence and the prosecution on the matter of the law as it regards freedom of expression; because of this, the trial was "concerned, ultimately, only with the narrow fact-based question of whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that your using a public communications network on one day to post the video onto your video channel, constituted an offence contrary to section 127(1)(a) of the Communications Act 2003". He said the ruling sets no precedent.
Meechan started a GoFundMe campaign on 24 April 2018 to raise £100,000 for an appeal and reached his goal as of 25 April. In August 2018, Meechan announced that his request for an appeal had been denied by a member of the Sheriff Appeal Court, who also accused Meechan's lawyer of contempt. The letter stated that the appeal was "not arguable" due to the nature of the "deeply unpleasant offence". Meechan stated that he plans to contest the matter with the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. Meechan's lawyer Dorothy Bain subsequently petitioned the High Court of Justiciary to hear the case. Senior judge Lord Carloway opined that the High Court did not have the power to grant an appeal denied by the Sheriff Court. In March 2019, the £800 was seized from Meechan's bank account under an arrestment order.
On 17 June 2020, Meechan announced that his additional appeal to the Supreme Court was also rejected. Meechan stated his intention to bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights.
BBC Scotland planned to feature Meechan in a 2019 debate program, "The Collective," and had him film two episodes. However, the network announced that these episodes would not be aired after a backlash over the announcement. BBC Three produced a documentary on Meechan's case which aired during the summer.
Politics.
On 16 June 2018, Meechan announced that he had joined UKIP along with fellow YouTubers Carl Benjamin and Paul Joseph Watson in what Watson describes as an attempted "soft coup".
In April 2019, Meechan said he intended to stand for MEP on behalf of UKIP in the upcoming 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom. He was named fourth on UKIP's list in Scotland, but was not elected after UKIP won only 1.8% of the vote in Scotland.
In November 2019, Meechan posted a video announcing that he had left UKIP, citing internal disputes and backstabbing within the party over their leadership as his reason for leaving.
On 25 July 2020, Meechan announced on Twitter that he had joined the Scottish Libertarian Party.
On 10 April 2021, Meechan made an announcement on Twitter that he is running in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election as a candidate for the Scottish Libertarian Party. He finished fifth in Motherwell and Wishaw with 254 votes. He was also first on the party's regional list for the Central Scotland region.
Electoral history.
2021
Personal life.
Meechan married Suzanne Kelly in 2019. They have a daughter, Sadie Meechan, born on 17 March 2021.
YouTube.
Meechan created his primary YouTube channel in 23 August 2015. It contains Meechan's comedic videos, also known as shitposts, and videos discussing his opinions on free speech. It also features his video series, titled "Absolute Mad Lads," which discusses various humans and animals in history and their perceived impressive character traits or actions. Meechan also has 2 other channels: his secondary channel, called Count Dankula 2: Electric Boogaloo and a now disused channel, called Count Dankula Streams.
He made a parody of the song Nations Of The World, titled the same, with lyrics parodying the stereotypes of the countries mentioned. The video would end up being removed by YouTube.

Frisiphoca

Frisiphoca is an extinct genus of phocid belonging to the subfamily Phocinae. It is known from fossils found in the late Miocene of Belgium.
Taxonomy.
There are two species of "Frisiphoca", "F. aberratum" and "F. affine". Both were previously assigned to "Monotherium", but Dewaele et al. (2018) found those species generically distinct from the "Monotherium" type species and placed them in their own genus, "Frisiphoca".
Fossils.
Fossils of "Frisiphoca aberratum" and "F. affine" occur in the Tortonian-age Diest Formation of the vicinity of Antwerp, Belgium. Ray (1976) tentatively referred to "F. aberratum" a humerus from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.

Siriraj Piyamaharajkarun Hospital

Siriraj Piyamaharajkarun Hospital (SiPH) () is a hospital operated by the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital of Mahidol University. It is located in Bangkok on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, adjacent to Siriraj Hospital and opposite Thammasat University (Tha Phra Chan Campus). The hospital is catered to high-income patients, similarly to Thailand's private hospitals, with one of its aims being to generate revenue for the operation of Siriraj Hospital.
History.
The Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University was transferred a piece of land adjacent to the Chao Phraya River from the State Railway of Thailand following the board resolutions since 2003 from the cabinet and State Railway of Thailand, and finally on 11 January 2010 with an area of 33 rai, 2 ngan, and 94 square wa (53,976 square meters). King Bhumibol Adulyadej graciously conferred Princess Sirindhorn to lay the foundation stone for the building part of the project 'Siriraj towards a top medical institute in Southeast Asia' around the old Bangkok Noi railway station and named the building 'Piyamaharajkarun Building'. On 6 July 2010, the Faculty of Medicine board renamed the building as 'Siriraj Piyamaharajkarun Hospital (SiPH)'. The hospital opened on 26 April 2012.

Tre Hjorter

Tre Hjorter is a former hotel located on the corner of Vestergade (No. 12) and Larsbjørnstræde in the Latin Quarter of central Copenhagen, Denmark. It now houses a bar on the ground floor. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1939.
History.
Erik Valkendorff, a relative of the later "stadtholder" Christoffer Valkendorf, acquired a property at the site in the middle of the 16th century. In 1681, his descendants sold it to a blacksmith, Jochum Pedersen, who sold off the land in lots. The corner lot was acquired by an innkeeper, Søren Rasmussen Hjortshøy, who opened a hotel at the site. Its name, De Tre Hjorter, thus contained a reference to his own last name. The hotel was one of many located on the north side of the street, a tradition that dated from a time when the Western City Gate was located at the end of Vestergade.
It was used by farmers who came into town on market day to sell their produce. The hotel was also frequented by young theologians from the provinces who had come to Copenhagen with the ambition of obtaining employment at one of the city's churches. In the 1720s, this resulted in a scandal that involved Tre Hjorter's owners, Peter and Ane Sørensen Berg. Ane claimed to have connections in the right circles and operated a lucrative business conveying bribes that were supposed to improve the aspiring priests' chances. In 1725, Ane was arrested and sentenced to time in the notorious Spinning House in Christianshavn while her husband was thrown out of Copenhagen. She was, however, pardoned the following year but also thrown out of the city.
A few years later, Tre Hjorter was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 but was rebuilt. A 15-year-old C. E. F. Weyse stayed at Tre Hjorter when he first came to Copenhagen from Altona and resided there until the composer Abraham Peter Schultz offered him accommodation in his apartment in Bredgade.
In 1795, Hotel Tre Hjorter was once again lost to the flames in the Second Great Fire. Its owner, Jørgen Sorterup, commissioned Lauritz Laurberg Thrane to rebuild his hotel. Construction started the following year and was completed in 1797. The mail coaches for destinations on Zealand began to use the complex as a terminus. The mail coaches entered the courtyard to the rear of the hotel through a gateway at Vestergade 12 and departed via a gateway at Larsbjørnstræde 10. The courtyard contained stables, warehouses and a post office.
The mail coaches disappeared when the new railway station opened in 1847. The old hostels in Vestergade were also faced with new competition when several large, modern hotels opened around the corner on Vester Voldgade in the 1880s and 1890s. Hotel Tre Hjorter was the only hotel left in Vestergade by the time that it closed in 1929.
All the buildings in the courtyard were demolished in 1939 and replaced by a modern four-storey building. The tenants in the new building included a photographer, an importer a men's hats, a manufacturer of blinds and a book printer.
Today.
Tyrolia Bier Klub, a bar owned by Rekon Group, is located in the ground floor. The premises has previously housed the bars Woodstock og Frøken Nielsen.
Cultural references.
Tre Kroner is mentioned in Ludvig Holberg's comedy "Den Ellevte Juni" ("11 June").

Boulton Paul P.112

The Boulton Paul P.112 was an elementary trainer designed by Boulton Paul Aircraft for the Royal Air Force.
Design and development.
The P.112 was developed from the successful Boulton Paul Balliol, an advanced trainer powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engine, sharing the same fuselage as the Balliol but with new high aspect ratio wings and a non-retractable spatted undercarriage of track. The trainer was equipped with three seats, similar to the Balliol and looked so like the earlier aircraft that the image in the brochure was actually a retouched Balliol T.1. However, the Royal Air Force preferred the smaller de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk to the P.112 and so no production ensued.

Noriphoca

Noriphoca is an extinct genus of phocid belonging to the subfamily Monachinae. It is known from the late Oligocene to early Miocene of Italy.
Species.
The type species of "Noriphoca", "N. gaudini", was originally named "Phoca gaudini" on the basis of a skull from late Oligocene to earliest Miocene deposits in Chiento, Italy. Later authors referred it to either "Monotherium", "Pristiphoca", or the physeteroid genus "Paleophoca". However, Dewaele et al. (2018) clearly demonstrated that "P. gaudini" cannot be referred to "Monotherium" due to lack of overlap with the "M. delognii" type material, which they recognized as phocine and not monachine, and erected "Noriphoca" for "P. gaudini".

Diuris immaculata

Diuris immaculata, commonly known as the little Esperance bee orchid, is a rare species of orchid that is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has between four and six leaves and up to three golden yellow flowers without markings. It is only known from near Esperance.
Description.
"Diuris immaculata" is a tuberous, perennial herb with between four and six linear to lance-shaped leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to three golden yellow flowers without markings, long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, wide and curves upwards. The lateral sepals are oblong to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide, held below the horizontal and parallel to each other. The petals are held above horizontal, egg-shaped to elliptic, long and wide on a green stalk long. The labellum is long, turns slightly downwards and has three lobes. The centre lobe is broadly egg-shaped to wedge-shaped, long and wide. The side lobes are egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide. There are two callus ridges long spreading apart from each other, near the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to November after fire.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris immaculata" was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected north-east of Esperance and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". The specific epithet ("immaculata") is a Latin word meaning "unstained" or "unspotted", referring to the pure yellow colour of the flowers of this orchid.
Distribution and habitat.
The little Esperance bee orchid grows in winter-wet areas from north-east of Esperance to the Cape Arid National Park.
Conservation.
"Diuris immaculata" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife,

Lonely (fashion label)

Lonely is a lingerie, swimwear and clothing label based in New Zealand. It was established in 2009 by Helene Morris and Steven Ferguson, who had created the Lonely Hearts Club label in 2003. Morris began making soft-cup bras in 2012 alongside their main clothing brand, but switched focus to lingerie due to demand. Lingerie from the Lonely label has gained a cult following and is often worn by celebrities such as Kylie Jenner.
Brand values and principles.
The label is known for embracing body positivity by using a diverse range of models and by not retouching photos. In 2017, to promote body positivity, Lena Dunham and Jemima Kirk starred in a series of untouched photos wearing the brand's lingerie. In August that same year, Lonely promoted their Autumn-Winter collection with 56-year-old model Mercy Brewer. In 2017, the label worked with terminally ill teenager, Eva McGauley to donate towards the charity she established.
In terms of production processes, Morris has stated that the company wanted to strengthen and support the lives of manufacturers. In 2018, Lonely received criticism when they featured a model with self-injury scars.
In 2019, critics stated that while the brand's marketing promotes body positivity, it does not include fat bodies in their marketing, nor sell lingerie above size 16 and a G cup.
On 2 December 2020, an article by David Farrier and Zoe Walker Ahwa explored allegations that the owners were embracing QAnon conspiracy theories on social media and not taking COVID-19 seriously. Several staff members said they were told that there was no need for customers to sign in as it was a "breach of their privacy" and that employees were not required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). In June 2020, thirteen staff members signed a letter to the owners expressing their concerns. Staff received a reply from the owners that said they took the concerns seriously but acknowledged there may have been a lack of clarity around social distancing and they were looking to nominate a health and safety representative. Immediately after its release, Farrier discussed the article with Jesse Mulligan on RNZ.

2018 Grand National

The 2018 Grand National (officially known as the Randox Health 2018 Grand National for sponsorship reasons) was the 171st annual running of the Grand National horse race at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool, England. The showpiece steeplechase was the pinnacle of a three-day festival which commenced on 12 April 2018. The event was sponsored by Randox Health for the second time.
The race was won by shot Tiger Roll, ridden by Davy Russell, in a photo finish from Pleasant Company. All 38 runners returned to the stables, although Saint Are required veterinary attention on the course and Charlie Deutsch, riding Houblon Des Obeaux, was treated on the track after a fall leading to Becher's Brook being bypassed on the second circuit.
Race card.
From an initial 105 entries, the final field of 40 runners was declared on 13 April, after Minella Rocco, Vicente and Beeves were all withdrawn from the race and replaced by Thunder And Roses, Delusionofgrandeur and Walk In The Mill. Two contenders, Regal Encore and Walk In The Mill a day after securing its position in the race, were withdrawn on the morning of the race, leaving 38 starters, the smallest field since 1999.
2018 also marked the first National for 30 years to feature three female jockeys in the line-up. 2012 third-placed jockey Katie Walsh paired Baie Des Iles for her sixth ride in the race, whilst Rachael Blackmore and Bryony Frost were both handed their first National rides on Alpha Des Obeaux and Milansbar respectively.
Race overview.
The first fence claimed Perfect Candidate who in turn brought down one of the favourites, Blaklion. I Just Know led the field until falling at Becher's Brook, which also saw Houblon Des Obleaux and Virgilio out of the race. Houblon Des Obeaux's jockey Charlie Deutsch was treated for injuries at the scene, resulting in Becher's being bypassed on the second circuit. Captain Redbeard unseated its rider at the Foinavon fence as Ucello Conti led the field from Double Ross, with The Dutchman, Milansbar and Pleasant Company also prominent. The Canal Turn saw the end of Lord Windermere, Buywise and Final Nudge. Chase The Spud pulled up before The Chair, which claimed Alpha Des Obeaux and Saint Are. 
Delusionsofgrandeur and Maggio were pulled up at the beginning of the second circuit, and The Dutchman unseated its rider at Foinavon as Pleasant Company took over the lead. Ucello Conti lost its rider three fences from home, while Seeyouatmidnight challenged Pleasant Company for the lead. Tiger Roll made its move and hit the lead on the 29th fence. On the run-in, Pleasant Company fought back and almost caught Tiger Roll, losing by a head. 
There were no fatalities, although Saint Are was treated by veterinarians after being brought down at The Chair. A few days later, Saint Are's retirement from racing was announced. Jockey Charlie Deutsch was kicked in the back by a horse following his fall at Becher's Brook, but recovered and rode a winner at Plumpton the following day.
Finishing order.
Twelve runners completed the course as follows:
Non-finishers.
The runners who failed to complete were as follows:
Broadcasting and media.
As the Grand National is accorded the status of an event of national interest in the United Kingdom and is listed on the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events, it must be shown on free-to-air terrestrial television in the UK. The race was broadcast live on TV by ITV, in the second year of its four-year deal as the exclusive terrestrial broadcaster of horse racing in the UK.
The coverage was co-anchored by Ed Chamberlin and Francesca Cumani. Analysis was provided by former Grand National winning jockeys Sir Anthony McCoy, Mick Fitzgerald and Ruby Walsh, the latter having been ruled out the Aintree meeting through injury. Reports were provided by Oli Bell, Alice Plunkett and Luke Harvey with updates from the betting ring by Matt Chapman and Brian Gleeson. The commentary team was Mark Johnson, Ian Bartlett and Richard Hoiles.

Ditto-Prewitt House

The Ditto-Prewitt House, at 306 Elm St. in West Point, Kentucky, is a historic house built in 1826. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
It is a two-story brick central passage plan five-bay house. In c.1960 a one-story porch with wrought-iron posts was added.
It was deemed "notable for its role in the commercial history of West Point and as a center for military operations during the Civil War. The house was built in 1826 for Abraham Ditto, a prominent West Point merchant, and his brother-dn-law, Samuel Lansdale. They had the house built, as an inn to supply lodging for Ohio River travellers. West Point was a major port along the Ohio River in the 19th century and it was one of several inns supplying overnight lodging along the river. The inn was built on the bluff overlooking the river and was operated by Ditto for several years. Later Ditto made the building his residence. During the Civil War, the house was used for three years as a military hospital and as a base hospital for the 9th Michigan Infantry. After the Civil War the house was purchased by Thomas Reed who used the building as a hotel. Known as the Reed Place, the hotel was in operation until the early
1900s. The property was purchased about 1905 by Dr. J.V. Prewitt who used the building as his residence and doctor's office. The building is presently used as a boarding house. The house was heavily damaged in the flood of 1937 but its essential form and original plan remain."

Variational asymptotic method

Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is a powerful mathematical approach to simplify the process of finding stationary points for a described functional by taking an advantage of small parameters. VAM is the synergy of variational principles and asymptotic approaches, variational principles are applied to the defined functional as well as the asymptotes are applied to the same functional instead of applying on differential equations due to its less prone to errors. This methodology is applicable for whole range of physics problems, where the problem has to be defined in a variational form and should be able to identify the small parameters within the problem definition.
In other words, VAM can be applicable where the functional is so complex in determining the stationary points either by analytical or by computationally expensive numerical analysis with an advantage of small parameters. Thus, approximate stationary points in the functional can be utilized to obtain the original functional.
Introduction.
VAM was first initiated by Berdichevsky in 1979 for shell analysis. He has been applied VAM to develop nonlinear shell theory in 1980 and for the beams in 1982. This method can completely justify as a right tool in constructing accurate models for dimensionally reducible structures and in analyzing geometric and material nonlinear models. Berdichevsky elucidated VAM procedure thoroughly and applied for shell structures to obtain the in-plane and out-of-plane warping functions, where an introduced warping function is a kind of bridge between 1-D and 3-D fields, and derived the analytical expressions to attain three dimensional displacements, stresses and strains.
In the beginning, the asymptotic methods are used to develop cross-sectional analysis of anisotropic beams with finite-element based solutions. The development of the formulation in the Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS) was started in 1988, and various former students of Hodges made contributions to this project, including Hodges, Cesnik and Hodges, and Yu et al. A more detailed account of the VABS history can be found in Hodges’s book. Thereafter, linear cross-sectional problems are solved for materials with anisotropic and inhomogeneous properties. VABS, a novel finite-element-based code, for the beam cross-sectional analysis and extended this work to piezoelectric materials which ultimately led for the development of VABS and UM/VABS. Hodges and his co-workers introduced many generalizations to cross sectional analysis. Subsequently, using VAM, an effective plate model unifying homogenization procedure and a dimensional reduction process were established, to deal with realistic heterogeneous plates VAPAS has been implemented which is based on finite element technique. This work has been extended for the analysis of laminated composite plates. VAM is also used to develop the Variational Asymptotic Method For Unit Cell Homogenization (VAMUCH) for heterogeneous materials.
Procedure.
In specific structural applications, in beams, the procedure begin with 3-Dimensional analysis and mathematically divide the analysis into 2-Dimensional cross section analysis and 1-Dimensional beam analysis. In the cross section analysis, 1-Dimensional constitutive law can be obtained and is provided as an input to the beam 1-Dimensional analysis. Closed form of analytical expression for warping functions along with set of recovery relations can be achieved to express the 3-D displacements, strains and stresses. In plates/shells, the 3-Dimensional problem splits into 1-Dimensional through the thickness and 2-Dimensional plate/shell analysis. Therefore, obtained 2-D constitutive law form the thickness analysis can be provided as input to 2-Dimensional analysis. Subsequently, recovery relations can be formed which presents the 3-D displacements, strains and stresses.
Advantages.
• No adhoc kinematic assumptions are required
• VAM is fully physics based and developed by neglecting the smaller energy contributions
• This method is capable to capture non-classical nonlinear effects automatically
• Asymptotes have been applied to functional instead of applying to differential equations, which led to less errors
• Mathematically rigorous theory, yet engineer-friendly end results
• VAM is an efficient method and obtained results are accurate
• Implementation of VAM can allow to use analytical and/or numerical approaches
• Right tool for the validation of asymptotical correctness with comparison of other theories
Applications.
VAM is extensively applied to the structural problems such as beams, plates, shells to find the stresses and strains as stationary points for a strain energy functional based on small parameters. In those structural problems, width and height are the small parameters for beams and thickness is the small parameter for plates and shells. In fact, small parameters (geometric and/or physical) are not limited to the above-mentioned parameters and those can be chosen based on the specific application of the defined problem.
In macro mechanics, VAM applied to dimensional reduction of beams, plates, shells and multifunctional structures, where considerable number of small parameters exists. In micro mechanics, VAM is capable in design and analysis of composites, where the fiber and matrix are involved. This methodology is applied not only to linear elastic materials with isotropic in nature but also to different kind of hyper elastic materials with orthotropic in nature, where the hyper elastic materials plays important role in the application of bio-implants, study of soft tissues behavior, high altitude airships etc. and the materials have geometric and material nonlinearities. In addition, this method is applicable for different type of materials such as dielectric materials, multi-functional composite materials, energy harvesting materials etc. This approach can be used in aerospace structural analysis, fabrics design and analysis, automotive industries etc. It can handle various type of analysis such as static, dynamic, multi-physics, buckling, modal problems. 
Subsequently, various computer codes have been developed with the basis of Variational Asymptotic Method such as Variational Asymptotic Beam Analysis (VABS), Variational Asymptotic Plate and Shell Analysis (VAPAS), Dynamic Variational Asymptotic Plate and Shell Analysis (DVAPAS) etc. These computer-based programs are well established and validated for the commercial applications and extensively used to analyze the behavior of composite structures. These various VAM-based developments culminated in the formalization of the mechanics of the structure genome (MSG) as a general framework for multiscale constitutive modeling of composite structures and materials, embodied in the code SwiftComp.

Buddy Mahar

Arthur "Buddy" Mahar (born April 29, 1945) is a former American college basketball coach. He most notably was the head coach of the Columbia Lions men's basketball team from 1978 to 1984.
Coaching career.
After graduation from Boston State College (now UMass Boston), Mahar became the head coach at Newbury College, then a junior college in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he guided the team to an 88-14 record from 1970 to 1973, before moving on to be the head coach at Notre Dame Prepparatory School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts from 1976 to 1978.
In 1978, Mahar joined Tom Penders staff at Columbia as an assistant coach and freshman coach, and replaced Penders when he left for Fordham to become 18th head coach in Lions history. In his six seasons at the helm, Mahar guided Columbia to a 70-86 overall record including two second-place finishes in 1978-79 and 1981-82. He was awarded NABC District II Coach of the Year honors in 1982 for guiding the Lions to a 16-10 season. While at Columbia, future college head coaches like Seth Greenberg served under Mahar.
After being fired at Columbia at the conclusion of the 1983-84 season, Mahar reunited with Penders, and joined his Fordham staff as an assistant coach from 1984 to 1986. After not being retained when Penders took the Rhode Island job, Mahar sat out of coaching in an attempt to sue Fordham for a breach of contract.
Mahar returned to coaching, joining the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights women's basketball team as an assistant coach in 1989. Mahar was part of a historic season for the Knights, as the 1991-92 team captured the Northeast Conference tournament title, which was later honored in the FDU Athletic Hall of Fame.
In 1993, Mahar accepted the head coaching job at Johnson State College in Vermont, where he spent three seasons as the head coach, and compiled a 44-34 record from 1992 to 1995, leading the Badgers to a Mayflower Conference championship in 1995 while also being named 1995 Mayflower Coach of the Year. Mahar ranks third all-time in wins at Johnson State.
After Johnson State, Mahar served as an assistant coach for one season under Tom Brennan at Vermont. He then relocated to Cortland, New York and was an assistant coach during the 2004-05 season at SUNY Cortland.

The 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier was the tournament played as part of qualification process for the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup.
Twelve regional qualifiers were held by the International Cricket Council (ICC), with 62 teams competing during 2018 in five regions – Africa (3 groups), Americas (2), Asia (2), East Asia Pacific (2) and Europe (3). The top 25 sides from these progressed to five Regional Finals in 2019, with seven teams then going on to compete in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier, along with the six lowest ranked sides from the ICC T20I Championship.
The first African sub-regional qualifier (North-Western sub region) was held in Nigeria, with the two other groups staged in Botswana and Rwanda. The top two teams in each group advanced to the regional finals tournament, which will determine two African entrants to the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier. In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to Twenty20 men's matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards. Therefore, all the matches in the Regional Finals were played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).
From the North-Western sub region group, both Ghana and Nigeria qualified for the Africa Regional Finals. Simon Ateak of Ghana was named the player of the tournament in the North-Western group. The second group, the Eastern sub region, started on 7 July 2018. Both Kenya and Uganda qualified for the Africa Regional Finals from the Eastern sub region group. Uganda's Riazat Ali Shah was named the player of the tournament for the Eastern group. From the Southern sub region group, Botswana and Namibia qualified for the Africa Regional Finals.
The Regional Finals were held in Uganda in May 2019. Namibia and Kenya both progressed to the T20 World Cup Qualifier after finishing first and second respectively in the Regional Finals. In July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, with the team barred from taking part in ICC events. As a result of their suspension, the ICC confirmed that Nigeria would replace them in the T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament.

Originally, the finals were scheduled to start on 19 May, but all three fixtures were washed out, with the matches rescheduled for the tournament's reserve day. Ahead of the final day of fixtures, Kenya, Namibia and Nigeria were all in contention of finishing in the top two places and progressing to the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament. However, all of the matches on the last day were washed out, therefore Namibia and Kenya both progressed to the T20 World Cup Qualifier after finishing first and second respectively in the Regional Finals.
In August 2019, the ICC confirmed that Nigeria had also progressed to the T20 World Cup Qualifier, after Zimbabwe had been suspended from taking part in international cricket tournaments in the previous month.

Missing link (human evolution)

"Missing link" is a non-scientific term for a transitional fossil. It is often used in popular science and in the media for any new transitional form. The term originated to describe the hypothetical intermediate form in the evolutionary series of anthropoid ancestors to anatomically modern humans (hominization). The term was influenced by the pre-Darwinian evolutionary theory of the Great Chain of Being and the now-outdated notion (orthogenesis) that simple organisms are more primitive than complex organisms.
The term "missing link" has fallen out of favor with biologists because it implies the evolutionary process is a linear phenomenon and that forms originate consecutively in a chain. Instead, last common ancestor is preferred since this does not have the connotation of linear evolution, as evolution is a branching process.
In addition to implying a linear evolution, the term also implies that a particular fossil has not yet been found. Many of the famous discoveries in human evolution are often termed "missing links". For example, there were the Peking Man and the Java Man, despite the fact that these fossils are missing. Transitional forms that have not been discovered are also termed missing links; however, there is no singular missing link. The scarcity of transitional fossils can be attributed to the incompleteness of the fossil record.
Historical origins.
The term "missing link" was influenced by the 18th century Enlightenment thinkers such as Alexander Pope and Jean-Jacques Rousseau who thought of humans as links in the Great Chain of Being. The Great Chain of Being is a hierarchical structure of all matter and life. Influenced by Aristotle's theory of higher and lower animals, the Great Chain of Being was created during the Medieval period in Europe and was strongly influenced by religious thought. God was at the top of the chain followed by man and then animals. It was during the 18th century that the set nature of species and their immutable place in the great chain was questioned. The dual nature of the chain, divided yet united, had always allowed for seeing creation as essentially one continuous whole, with the potential for overlap between the links. Radical thinkers like Jean-Baptiste Lamarck saw a progression of life forms from the simplest creatures striving towards complexity and perfection, a schema accepted by zoologists like Henri de Blainville. The very idea of an ordering of organisms, even if supposedly fixed, laid the basis for the idea of transmutation of species, for example Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.
The earliest publication that explicitly uses the term “missing link” was in 1844 in "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation" by Robert Chambers, which uses the term in an evolutionary context relating to gaps in the fossil record. Charles Lyell employed the term a few years later in 1851 in his third edition of "Elements of Geology" to as a metaphor for the missing gaps in the continuity of the geological column. The first time it was used as a name for transitional types between different taxa was in 1863, in Lyell's "Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man". "Missing link" later became a name for transitional fossils, particularly those seen as bridging the gulf between man and animal. Subsequently, Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley, and Ernst Haeckel used it in their works with this meaning.
Historical beliefs about the missing link.
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck envisioned that life is generated in the form of the simplest creatures constantly, and then strive towards complexity and perfection (i.e. humans) through a series of lower forms. In his view, lower animals were simply newcomers on the evolutionary scene. After Darwin's "On the Origin of Species", the idea of "lower animals" representing earlier stages in evolution lingered, as demonstrated in Ernst Haeckel's figure of the human pedigree. While the vertebrates were then seen as forming a sort of evolutionary sequence, the various classes were distinct, the undiscovered intermediate forms being called "missing links."
Haeckel claimed that human evolution occurred in 24 stages and that the 23rd stage was a theoretical missing link he named "Pithecanthropus alalus" ("ape-man lacking speech"). Haeckel claimed the origin of humanity was to be found in Asia. He theorized that the missing link was to be found on the lost continent of Lemuria located in the Indian Ocean. He believed that Lemuria was the home of the first humans and that Asia was the home of many of the earliest primates; he thus supported that Asia was the cradle of hominid evolution. Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin's hypothesis of human origins in Africa.
The search for a fossil that connected man and ape was unproductive until the Dutch paleontologist Eugene Dubois went to Indonesia. Between 1886 and 1895 Dubois discovered remains that he later described as "an intermediate species between humans and monkeys". He named the hominin "Pithecanthropus erectus" (erect ape-man), which has now been reclassified as "Homo erectus." In the media, the Java Man was hailed as the missing link. For instance, the headline of the Philadelphia Enquirer on February 3, 1895, was "The Missing Link: A Dutch Surgeon in Java Unearths the Needed Specimen".

2018 Kentucky Derby

The 2018 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 2018 Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve) was the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby, and took place on Saturday, May 5, 2018, in Louisville, Kentucky. The field was open to 20 horses, with a purse of million. The Derby is held annually in Louisville on the first Saturday in May, at the end of the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival. It is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of , and has been run at Churchill Downs racetrack since its inception in 1875.
The race was broadcast by NBC, with coverage by NBCSN of undercard races beginning at 12:30pm EDT and main network coverage of pre-race activities starting at 2:30pm EDT. Post time was 6:52pm EDT. The race was won by Justify, who was the post-time favorite, in a time of 2:04.20 over a sloppy track. It is the first time since 1882 that the race was won by a horse that did not race at the age of two.
Qualification.
The Kentucky Derby is only open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds, thus all entrants in the 2018 race were part of the 2015 North American live foal crop of roughly 22,000. The field was limited to twenty horses who qualified based on points earned in the 2018 Road to the Kentucky Derby, a series of designated races that was first introduced in 2013. This point system replaced the previous graded stakes race earnings system.
The top points earner in the 2018 series was Magnum Moon (150 points), winner of the Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby. Good Magic, the champion two-year-old from 2017, finished second in the series by winning both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and the Blue Grass Stakes. The other major prep winners were Noble Indy (Louisiana Derby), Mendelssohn (UAE Derby), Audible (Florida Derby), Vino Rosso (Wood Memorial) and Justify (Santa Anita Derby).
Churchill Downs also created separate qualification roads for horses based in Japan and Europe. None of the invitations for qualifiers on the Japan Road was accepted. On the European Road, the connections of Gronkowski accepted after the colt qualified first. However, the colt subsequently became ill and had to miss the race.
Field.
The early favorite was Justify, who had made only three starts before the race but won each time with triple-digit Beyer Speed Figures. In the Derby, he had to surmount what came to be known as "Curse of Apollo" – a reference to the fact that no horse had ever won the Derby without racing while at age two since Apollo in 1882. "Justify is a natural and he's still green, just learning how to run. He's so talented", said his trainer Bob Baffert. "But there are a lot of nice horses out there this year."
Trainer Todd Pletcher, who won the 2017 Kentucky Derby with Always Dreaming, had four of the leading contenders: Magnum Moon, Audible, Vino Rosso, and Noble Indy. Magnum Moon was ranked number two on the National Thoroughbred Racing Association top three-year-old poll of April 16 after his win in the Arkansas Derby. He had made only four starts prior to the Kentucky Derby, like Justified not having raced at age two. Audible was ranked number three, while Vino Rosso and Noble Indy were ranked seventh and eighth respectively. 
The two colts with the best form at age two, Good Magic and Bolt d'Oro, were ranked fourth and fifth respectively on the same poll. They were the winter-book favorites for the Derby, but both suffered training setbacks that delayed their return to the racetrack. They both had one win from two starts at age three going into the Derby.
Adding an international element to the field was Mendelssohn, trained in Ireland by Aidan O'Brien. Mendelssohn started his racing career on the turf and proved his ability to ship well by winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf at Del Mar in California in 2017. However, O'Brien felt that the colt would be equally suited to racing on the dirt given his pedigree: Mendelssohn is a half brother to multiple Eclipse Award-winner Beholder. Mendelssohn earned his berth by winning the UAE Derby in an "astonishing" performance while setting a track record.
Entries for the Kentucky Derby were taken on May 1. Justify drew post position 7 and was installed as the 3-1 morning line favorite by oddsmaker Mike Battaglia.
Race Description.
Because the Derby was held on a rainy day, the surface of the track was sealed to mitigate the effect of heavy rain on the footing. Nonetheless, the track condition was sloppy. By post time, more than of rain had been recorded that day at nearby Louisville International Airport, breaking the Derby Day precipitation record of that had been set in 1918. Despite the rain, a crowd of 157,813 attended the event, the eighth largest in Derby history, and the wettest of all time. A record $149.2 million was bet on the Derby itself from all sources, while the full card earned an all-source handle of $225.7 million, up 8% from the previous year's record.
On the track, Justify's jockey Mike Smith used the colt's early speed to gain vantage position near the rail moving into the first turn. He was positioned just a length after Promises Fulfilled and maintained this position down the backstretch. Following them closely were Flameaway, Bolt d'Oro and Good Magic. Although the opening fractions (22.24 for the first quarter, 45.77 for the half, 1:11.01 for the three-quarters) were fast, Smith said Justify felt "very comfortable".
In the final turn, Bolt d'Oro and later Good Magic were both put to a drive, while Promises Fulfilled began to drop back. Justify responded to urging to open up a lead of lengths as they turned into the stretch, widening to lengths at the finish line. Bolt d'Oro tired, eventually finishing in twelfth place, but Good Magic persevered to finish second. Audible closed from twelfth place to finish third, just a head behind Good Magic.
It was the fifth Derby win for Baffert and the second for Smith.
Mendelssohn, who went off as the third choice in the betting, broke well from post position 14 but was hit hard shortly after the start by Magnum Moon, who veered over from post position 16. Losing ground and "banged around in traffic", Mendelssohn was eased and finished last. On the other hand, Instilled Regard, who broke from post position 15 and was also involved in the initial bumping incident, rallied from 17th place to finish fourth.

7th Army (RSFSR)

The 7th Army was a field army of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War, which existed between November 1918 and February 1920. 
History.
The 7th Army was formed on November 1, 1918 from the units of the former Olonets group of troops, the 2nd Petrograd Infantry Division and the Pskov Rifle Division. It was part of the Northern Front which fought against Entente troops and the White Northern Army which were based in Archangelsk and Murmansk. After the disbandment of Northern Front the 7th Army was transferred to the Western Front.
The 7th Army also took part in the Soviet campaign against Estonia. On November 22, 1918, units of the 7th Army attacked Narva for the first time, but the assault was repulsed by the German troops still remaining in the city. A week later, the Soviet troops seized the city. Then the troops of the 7th Army began to advance westward, and by early January 1919 they were 35 kilometers from Tallinn. But on January 7, 1919, the Estonian 1st division launched a counter-offensive, and already on January 19 the Estonians and Finns took Narva and entered the territory of the Petrograd Governate.&lt;br&gt; 
In spring 1919 the 7th Army defended the approaches to Petrograd against Finnish troops on the Karelian and Onega-Ladoga Isthmus, the White Guard Northern Corps of Major-General Dzerozhinsky and Estonian troops south of the Gulf of Finland. 
On June 21 the 7th Army launched an offensive against the troops of the Northwestern Army (the former Northern Corps). On August 5, Yamburg was taken, after which they halted their advance.&lt;br&gt;
In the autumn of 1919, the troops of the Northwestern Army under Major-General Alexander Rodzyanko and from October 2, General Nikolai Yudenich undertook a second attempt to conquer Petrograd. The outskirts of the city were reached but the reinforced 7th Army was able to halt their advance and launched a counteroffensive on October 21. The North-Western Army was pushed back in chaos and disintegrated. Its remains retreated into Estonia where they were interned. On December 31, an armistice agreement between the RSFSR and Estonia came into force, and on February 2, 1920, the Tartu Peace Treaty was concluded, which meant the end of the war in the Northwest of the RSFSR.
Immediately afterwards, the administration of the 7th Army was disbanded.

Rotten (TV series)

Rotten is an investigative documentary series produced by Zero Point Zero, focusing on corruption in the global food supply chain. The show's first season was released on Netflix in January 2018, and the second season in October 2019. Each show "dives deep into the food production underworld to expose the corruption, waste and real dangers behind your everyday eating habits," featuring interviews with manufacturers, distributors, and others. The series uncovers wrongdoing by corporations who control the food that we eat and shortcomings by governments who have the mandate to oversee or regulate the sources of these food.
Reception.
The second season was nominated for a News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award for "Outstanding Business and Economic Documentary", while the reporting team — journalists Christine Haughney, Erin D. Cauchi, and Gretchen Goetz — won the 2020 James Beard Media Award for "Visual Reporting (on TV or Online)." General reception to the series has also been positive, with an average rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes.
The first season was praised for its "exploration of how corporate greed and corruption have quite literally changed the nature and origins of the food America consumes." It also received accolades for high-quality cinematography and compelling, human-centered narratives but was criticized for focusing on particular issues rather than providing explanation for wider industry problems, or giving the viewer answers as to which brands and products are unaffected by the issues the series presents.

Crow Flies High

Crow Flies High (Hidatsa: "Beericga Maaguhdaa Neesh"; ca. 1830s-1900) was the chief of a band of dissident Hidatsa people from 1870 until their band joined the reservation system in 1894. This band was one of the last to settle on an Indian reservation. A North Dakota State Park is named after him.
Smallpox epidemic and Like-a-Fishhook Village.
Smallpox struck the Hidatsa community in 1837 and decimated the population. Together with the remnants of their allies the Mandan tribe, the survivors built the Like-a-Fishhook Village further up the Missouri River around 1845. Having lost his closest relatives in the epidemic, Crow Flies High was raised by Eats-From-The-Line clan members.
In 1870, Crow Flies High left the joint Hidatsa, Mandan and Arikara Indian reservation at Fort Berthold in North Dakota due to conflict with the chiefs. He and his followers settled near the military post Fort Buford. Ordered away in 1884, they built a new village of sheds near the mouth of Little Knife River. By keeping a low profile while hunting small game in the area, the band managed largely to stay outside the reservation system until 1894.
Crow Flies High chose to reject the leadership of the traditional ceremonial elders. His heretical faction gathered around the new leader Bobtail Bull, a Hidatsa, with Crow Flies High functioning as the military chief.
Around this time in 1870, a severe conflict "approaching civil war" emerged in Like-a-Fishhook village. Crow Flies High and Bobtail Bull accused some leaders of unfair distribution of government rations. Tension grew between the rival groups. Persistent rumors about a plan to murder Crow Flies High circulated. Urged to leave at least for a time, Crow Flies High and Bobtail Bull headed up river. From 140 to 200 discontented Hidatsas and Mandans went along. The Hidatsa dissidents came from every clan.
The Garden Coulee village.
The dissident band settled on the north bank of the Missouri, about two miles above the mouth of Yellowstone River on an outlying part of the Fort Buford Military Reservation (see Map 1). Nearby Fort Buford reduced the risk of attacks on the small village from the Sioux and it provided a market for furs and robes. The Hidatsa had never fought the U.S. Army and the garrison accepted them in the area. The new settlement consisted mostly of log cabins, earth lodges, and a number of families dug storage pits.
In 1886, Crow Flies High described the early years in the settlement near Garden Coulee. "We subsisted ourselves by hunting Buffalo and Deer ... and selling our hides at Fort Buford". Gardens were laid out as bison became rare. Some of the people enlisted early as scouts and hunters at the fort and received regular pay. Prostitution and begging at the fort occurred when game went scarce. Captain Charles A. Coolidge provided for a number of aged and needy villagers in 1880. On one occasion, Crow Flies High quickly paid damages for a few heads of domestic cattle butchered by young men from the village.
Regularly, families resettled at Like-a-Fishhook Village, while new ones joined the dissidents and moved into vacated log houses. The average population was around 150 when the village was inhabited. It served mainly as a place for the winter and as a stopover for Hidatsa hunting camps going up Yellowstone River. The Garden Coulee villagers received government rations during visits to Like a Fishhook village. 
With time, Crow Flies High was recognized chief of the village.
Unwanted near Fort Buford.
For most of a decade the interactions between the people in the Native settlement and the soldiers at Fort Buford were peaceful. Things changed in 1883. The Sioux were no longer a threat to the fort and the soldiers. The village population climbed to 240 inhabitants. The commander wanted the settlement closed. A few earlier attempts to motivate Crow Flies High to leave Fort Buford Military Reservation and stay on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation had failed. On September 20, 1884, commanding officer J.N.G. Whistler finally reported the villagers on their way, "... although many of them have been living here for fifteen years". Fort Buford bought the abandoned Indian log cabins for firewood. The migrants spent the 44 dollars thus made on supplies for the movement downstream.
Crow Flies High village.
The villagers started a new village on a site near some valleys where they already had small gardens. About twenty-five rectangular cabins were built close to the Missouri River a few miles above the mouth of Little Knife River (see Map 2). A single and simple earth lodge used as a "dance hall" stood in the southern quarter of the village. The settlement was inside the reservation, but more than 50 miles from Like-a-Fishhook Village and "the agency-mission complex".
The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation was reduced late in 1886 (agreement ratified 1891). Once again, the dissidents lived outside its borders (see Map 3). No children attended the reservation school, which was a major concern for the different Indian Agents. Some believed they had persuaded Crow Flies High to consent to reservation rules, just to be disappointed.
Crow Flies High lived in the village with his two wives. A son of his had his own cabin. The village Indians hunted deer and small game and raised crops. They sold firewood to steamboats on the Missouri. Once accused of killing beef cattle by ranchers in the area, Crow Flies High went to the Agency and defended himself and the village. Indian Agent Abram J. Gifford accepted the explanation of Crow Flies High, so the case ended with defeat to the stockgrowers.
The last years of Crow Flies High.
In 1894, Crow Flies High resigned as chief. It happened just before Fort Buford soldiers and Hidatsa scouts escorted him and 125 Hidatsa, 23 Mandan and 1 Arikara to the agency. Some Hidatsa would later blame the soldiers for seemingly ignoring "all our men who had gone out and been scouts for them". The people, now under the leadership of Long Bear, traveled in a long line. They used both pack and travois horses as well as Red River carts on the move.
Although assigned allotments all over the reservation, the group slowly assembled in the Shell Creek area.
Crow Flies High died of pneumonia in 1900. The Crow Flies High State Recreation Area in North Dakota is named after him.

Henriette Feuerbach

Henriette Feuerbach (13 August 1812 – 5 August 1892) was a German author and arts patron. She was the wife of Joseph Anselm Feuerbach and the stepmother of painter Anselm Feuerbach, whom she supported in his art.
Life.
Born Henriette Heydenreich in Ermetzhofen, she was the third child and only daughter of the pastor Johann Alexander Heydenreich (1754–1814) and his wife Friederika Christine née Freudel. Her brothers were Friedrich Wilhelm Heidenreich, to become a physician, and Christian Heydenreich (1800–1865), a future judge. They grew up in Ansbach and were educated in Latin, Greek and music.
She married on 13 April 1834 the widower Josef Anselm Feuerbach, whose first wife was Amalie Keerl (1805–1830). She lived with him and his two children, Emilie (1827–1873) and Anselm (1829–1880), first in Freiburg im Breisgau, later in Heidelberg. She gave piano lessons, directed a choir, and organised house concerts. Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms were among those who frequented her salon. Brahms and Henriette held each other in high esteem; in one of Brahms' letters he referred to her and Anselm as "this splendid woman and her illustrious son". After Anselm's death, Brahms composed "Nänie" (1881) in his memory and included a dedication to Henriette.
She invested most of her energies into supporting her stepson's efforts to establish himself as an artist and, after his death in 1880, to perpetuate his legacy. After he died, she reportedly destroyed all his personal letters and published a collection of his writings "which show him purely as an artist, as a genius wrestling with himself, his work and ignorant patrons", in an effort to build a legacy for him. This indeed furthered his renown for the next few decades.
She died in Freiburg, eight days short of her 80th birthday.
Writing.
In 1839 she published anonymously "Gedanken über die Liebenswürdigkeit von Frauen", subtitled as "Kleiner Beitrag zur weiblichen Charakteristik" (A little contribution to the characteristics of women). In 1845, she published "Sonntagsmuße" (Sunday Rest), announced as a book for women. She edited with Hermann Hettner a collection of the writings of her husband after his death, working on the first of four volumes. In 1866, she published "Uz und Cronegk", the portraits of two Franconian poets of the 18th century. She also published reviews in newspapers and magazines.
Her letters, edited by Hermann Uhde-Bernays, document over a period of 50 years her influence on the education and development of Anselm Feuerbach. She published in 1882 a book "Ein Vermächtnis – Anselm Feuerbach" (A Legacy), to promote his recognition after his death in 1880. It was successful and has been in print in 50 editions.

Guinea-Bissau Air Force

The Guinea-Bissau Air Force () is the air force arm of the military of Guinea-Bissau.
History.
On leaving Bissalanca by 1973–74, the Portuguese Air Force left three North American T-6Gs. After achieving independence from Portugal, the air force was formed by officers returning from training in Cuba and the USSR. The FAGB was re-equipped by the Soviet Union with a limited aid package in which its first combat aircraft were introduced. Five MIG-17s and two MiG-15UTI trainers entered service with a single Mi-8 helicopter.
In 1978 France provided more aircraft aid in the form of a Reims-cessna FTB.337 for coastal patrol and a surplus Alouette III. A Dassault Falcon 20F was donated by the Angolan government but was soon sold to the USA. In the late 1980s a similar number of MiG 21s replaced the MiG 17s, also delivered an An-24, a Yak-40 and another Mi-8 helicopter. In the early 90s they received ex-polish PZL-Mielec Lim-6 Fresco fighter bombers from Poland and East Germany.
The force's title was changed to Força Aérea da Guiné-Bissau (FAGB) after the outbreak of the civil war in 1998. Cooper and Weinert state 'when sighted for the last time in ..1991, most of the [MiG] fleet was in 'storage' inside several hangars on the military side of Bissalanca IAP (Osvaldo Vieira International Airport), and in a deteriorating condition.'
As of 2015 Guinea-Bissau has no aircraft in flying condition, with the last known type a SE.3105 helicopter, which ceased operating in 2011.
Aircraft condition.
The status of most of the aircraft is unknown. All of the current aircraft are "in storage" at Osvaldo Vieira International Airport along with retired aircraft like the An-2 and Yakovlev Yak-40. The MiG-21s, MiG-17s, MiG-15s and Alouette IIs can be seen in the multiple hangars. 
Aircraft.
Current inventory.
Air Force has only a Cessna 150
Former inventory:, MiG-17, MiG-15, Alouette III, Falcon 20, Alouette II Yakovlev Yak-40, Dornier Do 27, PZL-Mielec Lim-6, North American T-6, Antonov An-2, Reims-Cessna FTB.337, Douglas DC-3, Antonov An-26, Mil Mi-4.

Vanasthalipuram Lutheran Church

Vanasthalipuram Lutheran Church is a Lutheran Church located in Hyderabad, India.
History.
Before 1984, Lutheran families living in the Vanasthalipuram area attended the Lutheran church at Lakdikapool. At that time, Peter and Nanda Koteshwar Rao requested Reverend Lam Charles to start Sunday worship services at Vanasthalipuram. The families of Bandela Moses, K Abraham Lincoln, Balla Ratana Raju, Rapaka Ratana Kumar, B.A. Willington, E.D. Livingston, Peter, Koteshwar Rao, assembled in a private school with the name Pinky Flavour. The first worship was held on 7 October 1984. The school is now underground, rendering it impossible to get to.
The church faced so many problems in its initial efforts to continue church services that P Raja Mohan Roy and B John Babu took over and helped to continue Sunday services and other festivals. Rev. Dr. M. Victorpal (ACTC Professor) established and lead the church. Professors from ACTC Rev. S.V.Lutherpal, Rev. B.C. Pal, Rev. Sampurna Rao, Rev. Yesupadam, Rev. David Raj, attended to run all kind of worship.
Smt. B. Lilly Willington used to run Sunday school regularly, and was known for making special efforts to make female churchgoers more pious. When the school was moved, services continued in the house of T Yesuspadam for the next four years.
Construction of the present church was completed in 1993. The church was ceremonially opened for use in a service led by Rev. B.C Pal, Synod president, and Rev. C.H Yohan. Until it is elevated to the status of "B" Class Parish by the AELC Guntur, Lutheran church Lakdikapool continued to pay the pastor's salary. 
The project had an estimated budget of over Rs.45, and was completed in its entirety in November 2007. The formal inauguration ceremony for the church was led by Dr.V.E Christopher and Rev. Elea. At that time the parish pastor was Rev. Prasanna Kumar. Every year, church anniversary celebrations take place on 6 and 7 October.

Internet Video Coding

Internet Video Coding (ISO/IEC 14496-33, MPEG-4 IVC) is a video coding standard. IVC was created by MPEG, and was intended to be a royalty-free video coding standard for use on the Internet, as an alternative to non-free formats such as AVC and HEVC. As such, IVC was designed to only use (mostly old) coding techniques which were not covered by royalty-requiring patents.
According to a blog post by MPEG founder and chairman Leonardo Chiariglione in 2018, "IVC is practically dead." He said that three companies had made statements equivalent to "I may have patents and I am willing to license them at FRAND terms" covering IVC, meaning that implementations might have to pay money to the companies. These statements meant that IVC was not clearly a royalty-free video coding format; those companies would need to be contacted to determine whether they had essential patents and to determine the terms for their use which might involve the payment of some fees.
The ITU-T/ITU-R/ISO/IEC patent policy defines three types of patent licensing. The goal for IVC was to only use techniques patented under type 1 (royalty-free), while the three companies said they may have patents under type 2 (possibly requiring royalty payments). The text of the code of practice is as follows:
2.1 The patent holder is willing to negotiate licences free of charge with other parties on a non-discriminatory basis on reasonable terms and conditions. Such negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside ITU-T/ITU-R/ISO/IEC.
2.2 The patent holder is willing to negotiate licences with other parties on a non-discriminatory basis on reasonable terms and conditions. Such negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside ITU-T/ITU-R/ISO/IEC.
2.3 The patent holder is not willing to comply with the provisions of either paragraph 2.1 or paragraph 2.2; in such case, the Recommendation | Deliverable shall not include provisions depending on the patent.
History.
MPEG issued a Call for Proposals in July 2011 for royalty-free video coding formats. Three proposals were received:
Web Video Coding did not have a guarantee from all patent holders that the patents covering Web Video Coding would be licensed royalty-free.
IVC's compression performance was reported to be better than that of WVC and VCB, and IVC was approved as ISO/IEC 14496-33 in June 2015.

Georges de Soultrait

Georges Richard Soultrait also known as Count de Soultrait, was a French writer and historian born June 27, 1822 in Toury-Lurcy, in the department of Nièvre and died September 18, 1888 in the same village.
Family.
A member of the Soultrait family, he was born in 1822 in Toury in the family castle and was the son of Gaspard-Antoine-Samuel Richard of Soultrait, Roman count "in a personal capacity" by pontifical brief of September 28, 1855 (born on June 3, 1793 in Nevers, and died in 1858), second lieutenant of the young Guard imperial, then captain in 1814, officer of the Legion of Honor, medalist of St. Helena, commander of the pontifical order of St. Gregory the Great, and Hyacinthe-Esther Outrequin de Saint-Léger (1792-1878)).
He married on September 10, 1850 in Paris, Desiree Jeans (1825-1888) and they had 7 children.
Career.
He was first attached to the Ministry of Finance and then collector-collector in Lyon in 1863, the city where he resided until 1876, successively occupying the functions of President of the Savings Bank, administrator of the general dispensary and Member of the Board of Directors of the Hospices Civils. He then served as treasurer-general of Haute-Marne and Doubs.
Very early, he also has political responsibilities since he became Mayor of Toury at the age of 26 and, shortly thereafter, member of the General Council of Nièvre.
He was one of the founders of the Nivernese Society of Arts, Sciences and Arts (1851). Succeeding Monseigneur Crosnier and Louis Roubet, he became its president in 1886 until his death in 1888 at his château de Toury.
Many of his publications (see the list below) are, even today, so many must-sees for Nivernais researchers, such as his Topographic Dictionary of the Department of Nièvre (1862).
In 1862, on the proposal of the Committee on Historical and Scientific Works, he received the Legion of Honor.
He received a title of Roman count by pontifical brief of Pope Pius IX of August 2, 1850.
A street in Nevers bears his name.

Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is a carbon offset and carbon reduction scheme to lower CO2 emissions for international flights, to curb the aviation impact on climate change.
&lt;section begin="summary" /&gt;Developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and adopted in October 2016. Its goal is to have a carbon neutral growth from 2020.
CORSIA uses Market-based environmental policy instruments to offset CO2 emissions: aircraft operators have to purchase carbon credits from the carbon market. Starting in 2021, the scheme is voluntary for all countries until 2027.&lt;section end="summary" /&gt;
Background.
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol include CO₂ emissions from airports and domestic aviation in its first period (2008–2012), but not international aviation CO₂ emissions or climate effects beyond CO₂. From 2009, Governments agreed to work for the Kyoto Protocol to reduce and to allocate international aviation emissions through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). An agreement was not reached during the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference. Failure to reach an agreement could lead to the average global temperature rising above 2 °C, not avoiding dangerous climate change.
In 2009, the air transport industry targeted a fuel efficiency improvement of 1.5% per year until 2020; carbon-neutral growth capping CO₂ emissions from 2020; and halving its CO₂ emissions by 2050 compared to 2005. In 2010, international flights emitted of carbon dioxide.
Adoption.
In October 2016, the 191 nations of the ICAO established the scheme, requiring operators to purchase carbon offsets to cover their emissions above 2020 levels, starting from 2021. Forestry and carbon-reducing activities will be funded by 2% of the sector annual revenues, avoiding "double counting" of existing efforts. CORSIA is voluntary until 2027, but many countries including the US and China, promised to begin from the 2020 start. The WWF saw carbon credits as credible, but the scheme appears insufficient in the long run while review periods are included.
The agreement does not include an objective of containing global warming to 1.5-2 °C like the 2015 Paris climate agreement. As emissions below 2020 levels are grandfathered, CORSIA will regulate 25% of aviation's international emissions. CORSIA applies to international flights representing 60% of aviation emissions, and the initial voluntary period include 65 nations, leaving out Russia, India and perhaps Brazil. Advocacy group and observer Transport and Environment thinks CORSIA won’t reduce demand for jet fuel, while Greenpeace called it "a timid step in the right direction."
Non-governmental organizations formed the Stay Grounded network in various countries during the 2016 ICAO conference. Fifty organisations including Attac Europe, Friends of the Earth International, Global Justice Now, Greenpeace, Indigenous Environmental Network, among others, signed a petition against airport expansion. One hundred organisations including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth signed a civil society statement rejecting ICAO’s aviation’s emissions offset scheme, as it would cause global warming to surpass 1.5 °C.
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, the value of 2019 emissions will be used for the pilot phase of the CORSIA implementation from 2021 to 2023.
Implementation.
On 15 February 2019, the ICAO announced an agreement on alternative fuels to reduce offsets, but details on how to reach the target of halving 2005-level emissions by 2050 remain elusive. 
On 18 February, the European Council urged the ICAO to implement Corsia swiftly and to “agree on a long-term goal at its next assembly” in September.
For the Air Transport Action Group, the ICAO could take three years to negotiate, until 2022.
Fossil fuels produced from newer oil wells, or with some more efficient refinery processing will be eligible. Aviation biofuels from a variety of feedstocks including palm oil, the most likely source and a leading cause of deforestation, would be eligible for use.
As of January 2018, more than 70 countries representing more than 85% of international aviation activity have volunteered to participate. India and Russia are yet to join CORSIA. India, which has four of the five carbon-neutral airports in the Asia-Pacific region and the world's first fully solar powered airport, has drawn attention to "differentiated responsibilities" and the "need to ensure the transfer of financial resources, technology transfer and deployment and capacity building support to developing countries for enabling them to voluntarily undertake action plans.".
Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States and Landlocked Developing Countries can volunteer to participate in CORSIA, while it is not mandated on them. However, all ICAO member states "with aeroplane operators conducting international flights are required to monitor, report and verify carbon dioxide emissions from these flights every year from 2019". All aeroplane operators with emissions less than or equal to 10,000 tonnes are exempted from the CORSIA reporting requirements.
Emissions from domestic air travel are not included in CORSIA. ICAO states that "Emissions from domestic aviation, as other domestic sources, are addressed under the UNFCCC and calculated as part of the national GHG inventories and are included in national totals (part of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs))..."
Criticisms.
CORSIA is a market based mechanism to offset emissions: an airline would purchase carbon credits to offset its emissions.
The Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport of the european commission has described it as "a delicate compromise between all involved in its elaboration."
The scheme may address a significant part of emissions from the expansion of international aviation.
Aviation related emissions are not capped.
Offsetting focuses on emissions trading rather than reducing emissions.
Forest offsets could predominate, but their effectiveness could be reduced by wildfires, droughts, pests, illegal logging and geopolitical dynamics, making it difficult to measure, verify or guarantee carbon sequestration.
Forest offset projects can result in human rights violations.
CORSIA may not be as stringent as the European Union Emission Trading Scheme.
Neste is the largest producer of biofuels from Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil, the most mature and economically viable technology for commercial aviation biofuels, and relies on crude palm oil and palm fatty acid distillate. Neste has decided to establish its aviation biofuel production in Singapore, in the largest palm oil producing region, linked to rampant deforestation.
Biofuels from palm oil could emit more CO2 than the replaced fossil fuels, and cause biodiversity loss.
CORSIA would create demand for aviation biofuel.

Jacques Spifame

 Jacques-Paul Spifame de Brou, born in Paris and died 25 March 1566 in Geneva, was a French prelate who converted to be a Calvinist during the 16th century.
Family.
Jacques-Paul Spifame de Brou was the son of Jean, lord of Passy and Bisseaux, secretary of the king, trésorier de l'extraordinaire des guerres, and his wife Jacquette Ruzé. His family was from Lucca (or Naples). His brother Raoul was an esoteric scholar and another brother Martin published in 1583 a collection of spiritual poems.
Catholic career.
Jacques Spifame was first regent at the college of Cardinal Le Moine. He is prosecutor of France, and successively rector of the University of Paris, chancellor, councilor in parliament from 1522, president of the chamber of inquiry in 1543, canon of Notre-Dame de Paris, dean of Saint-Marcel and Gassicourt, in 1531 first abbot commendatory of the abbey of Saint-Paul-sur-Vanne in Sens, whose archives he had destroyed in 1558 and finally, in 1544, vicar general of Charles, cardinal of Lorraine, archbishop of Reims. In 1546, he was appointed to the bishopric of Nevers.
Protestant Career.
Jacques was a State Councilor and attended the Estates General held in Paris. From that time, he favors the preaching of the doctrines of John Calvin.
Jacques Spifame lives for a long time in the greatest intimacy with Catherine de Gasperne, widow of Étienne le Hail, prosecutor at the Châtelet. He joined John Calvin in Geneva in 1559 and took the name of Passy, land which his father is lord. Passy is considered in Geneva by his manners, his wit and his knowledge. Made a minister by Calvin himself, he is appointed, in 1561, pastor of the Protestant church of Issoudun. Calvin sends him to Orléans with the Prince de Conde.
Since the first days of his arrival in Geneva, he has married his mistress whom he has a boy named André and a girl named Anne. One of his nephews having contested in the parliament of Paris, the legitimacy of the birth of these children, Jacques makes a false marriage certificate to win their case. In the meantime, Claude Servin, controller in the house of the Queen of Navarre, comes to accuse him of certain malpractices and in the meantime, gets to be imprisoned with him. He was sentenced to death for adultery and his head was slain in 1566.

He is known in Armenia as a man who brought food to the members of "Sasna Tsrer" armed group during the 2016 Yerevan hostage crisis. While doing it he rushed through the line of policemen, putting his life at risk. He was arrested after the events and went on hunger strike for 25 days. After that, he died of a heart failure derived from complications during surgery on intestinal rupture while being treated at the "Armenia" Medical Center. Deputy director of the medical center stated that he was taken to hospital, but it was too late. He is seen by many as a symbol of resistance to the Armenian ruling regime's heavy-handed response to popular protests.
He finished the National Polytechnic University of Armenia. During the Karabakh war he also brought meals to the front line and was wounded.
Sargsyan's death escalated protests in Yerevan. Armenian ombudsman demanded maximum transparency in the criminal investigation. Supporters of Arthur Sargsyan organized marches in Yerevan. He was nominated for the annual Aurora Prize.

Perlbach (Regen)

The Perlbach is a river in Bavaria in the provinces of Lower Bavaria and Upper Palatinate, which drains into the Regen west of Wiesing in the borough of Roding in the Upper Palatine county of Cham.
Name.
On the Lower Bavarian side and up to Falkenstein the Perlbach is still called by its original name of Miethnach.
That the name Miethnach is the older, is indicated by the name of the hamlet Mietnach am Perlbach (between Marienstein and Trasching), west of the Zinzenberg.
Course.
The "Perlbach" rises in the Lower Bavarian county of Straubing-Bogen south of Zinzenzell between Geraszell and the Edenhof. It flows, roughly speaking, northwestwards; its upper course more or less constantly, while its lower course runs in a large, roughly semi-circular arc towards the southwest and back. Early on it enters the Upper Palatine county of Cham, in which it remains until it reaches its mouth near Wiesing and empties into the Regen.
Its larger tributaries are the left-hand "Geißbach" which joins it near Völling, the left-hand "Urbachl" near Au and the longest, last and right-hand "Neudecker Bach" just after Trasching.

Hot Blood Dance Crew

Hot Blood Dance Crew () is an original Chinese reality street dance variety show produced by iQiyi. The show was officially aired and broadcast online on March 17, 2018 on iQiyi.
Concept.
"Hot Blood Dance Crew" brings together 191 dancers from all walks of life, both within and beyond China, including individual trainees who aren't associated with any agencies and they battle it out to be the best dancers in China.
Mentors.
The mentor teams are Luhan &amp; Jackson and William &amp; Victoria.
Rounds.
Round 1: Casting
The 191 dancers are stationed around the city. The two teams of mentors, Jackson &amp; Luhan and William &amp; Victoria, must go around using a map of where each crew is to cast dancers. Each team only has 30 spots.
Round 2: Ranking
Within each team dancers must rank themselves from 1-30. They enter one by one, if someone is sitting in the number spot they want, the two do a freestyle battle for it.
Round 3: 1 v. 1 Battle
One by one, starting at number 1, choose an opponent on the same team to do a choreography with. Their team mentor must then eliminate one of them.
Round 4: Group Dance
As a team the remaining 15 dancers must choreograph a 3 minute routine, in 48 hours under the concept ‘Brothers’. Before the performance each team must eliminate 3 people. Within this round team leaders ranked their contestants, the losing team must automatically eliminate their last place member.
Round 5: Bottom 3 survival
The contestants ranked in the bottom 3 must battle with the other team’s bottom 3. Each member is allowed to choose one person not in the bottom 3 to dance with them, making it a 2 v. 2 battle. The losing member of the bottom 3 must leave. 
Example; #10 teams up with #2 and they battle #10 and #4 from the other team. If the 10/2 team loses, #10 must leave. The special guests in this round include Galen Hooks and Rie Hata.
Round 6: Singer’s Collaboration
Each individual mentor randomly chooses a number. That number is the number of people that will perform with a singer of the mentor’s choice. The possible numbers are 1, 5, 7 and 8. They perform against the other team and the losing team must eliminate one member.
This round is decided by the votes of 99 dancers.
Round 7: Revival
The mentors from each team have chosen 3 people from their team that were previously eliminated that they want back. Each revival member gets to choose a current member of their team to represent them in a free style battle against another revival member’s representative. The winning representative then saves their revival member. This round is decided by the votes of 99 dancers.
Round 7.5: Revival Pt. 2 
The surviving revival members must choose a current member from the opposing team to battle against using a prepared choreography. The loser is automatically eliminated, whether they are a current or surviving revival member. This round is decided by the votes of 99 dancers.
Round 8: Subunit Themes
Each individual mentor has chosen a theme, making it 4 themes. Each team must create a subunit to dance to each theme, no subunit can have the same number of members. The themes given are ‘It’s just strong’, ‘Time control’, ‘Pink’ and ‘Butterfly Effect’. This round is decided by the votes of 99 dancers. The total number of votes throughout the 4 rounds are counted. The team with more overall votes win. The losing team must eliminate 3 team members.

Chlorantraniliprole

Chlorantraniliprole (Rynaxypyr) is an insecticide of the ryanoid class. Chlorantraniliprole is being developed world-wide by DuPont belonging to a new class of selective insecticides featuring a novel mode of action to control a range of pests belonging to the order Lepidoptera and some other Coleoptera, Diptera and Isoptera species.
Chlorantraniliprole opens muscular calcium channels (in particular the ryanodine receptor), rapidly causing paralysis and ultimately death of sensitive species. The differential selectivity Chlorantraniliprole had towards insect ryanodine receptors explained the outstanding profile of low mammalian toxicity. Chlorantraniliprole is active on chewing pest insects primarily by ingestion and secondarily by contact.
As active ingredient (a.i.) in insecticide -
a. Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR having the trade name Ferterra.
b. Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC having the trade name Coragen.

The Upper Palatine Hills (, also "Oberpfälzisches Hügel- und Bergland" or "Oberpfälzer Bruchschollenland") is a Hercynian range of rolling hills ("Hügelland") and valleys running from the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest in the (north-)east and the Franconian Jura in the (south-)west. It lies mostly within the Bavarian province of Upper Palatinate, hence the name. The range, which is oriented northwest to southeast, is about 100 kilometres long, but only between 7 and 35 kilometres wide and covers and area of 2,000 km². The best known settlements are (from northwest to southeast) Weiden (Ostrand), Amberg and Schwandorf.

Broadcast to Allied Merchant Ships

Broadcast to Allied Merchant Ships (BAMS) was a protocol and system of broadcasts for Allied Merchant ship convoys that was used during World War II to provide for the transmission of official messages to merchant ships in any part of the world. The BAMS system is designed for communication by the best employment of radio stations available.
Background.
On the outbreak of World War II, the British Admiralty took over control from the GPO, and the embryo merchant ship broadcast system, called "GBMS" came into force. Ships listened at routine times to the Rugby Radio Station and to area stations, otherwise keeping watch on the international distress frequency at 500 kHz. After the fall of France, the Admiralty assumed control of all Allied merchant shipping which complied with British procedures. When America entered the war, the world was divided into two strategic zones, the Admiralty being responsible for merchant shipping in one, and the United States Navy in the other.
The GBMS organisation proved to be inadequate for the efficient clearance of traffic for a number of reasons, including poor coverage by Wireless telegraphy (W/T) stations, obsolescent equipment, and many ships only able to listen at single or two operator periods. The systems gradually improved, and from 1942 all Allied merchant ships had to have two radio technicians on board, with more modern equipment being fitted to ships.
In 1942, the GBMS system was superseded by the combined Anglo-American system of BAMS, and the addition of US Navy W/T stations improved the poor coverage. For ship to shore communications, during Radio silence, ships in Convoy passed any essential messages through their escort for transmission. The Commodore's and Vice-Commodore's ships, rescue ships, merchant aircraft carriers, and ships fitted with Huff Duff were fitted when possible for intercommunication with other escort vessels.
Description.
The BAMS protocol was the second part of a two part communication protocol between shore to merchant ship. BAMS was for Radio communication, and the Visual signalling component, the first part was, called the: Visual Signalling Code and Instructions (WIMS-I), a publication held by the United Nations. Both BAMS and WIMS-I were essentially a safety protocol, to ensure reliable, "no mistake" communication.
Shore to Ship Communication.
The BAMS system divides the world into three zones, that are covered by a high-powered Zone station. Each zone is further sectioned with an Area station per section. Within a zone, multiple stations synchronize using Spread spectrum frequency radio to provide complete coverage. Image one called: "BAMS Zones of Operation" has a clear description, of delineation of control with the Zones.
BAMS Delineated Zones.
The following is an example of Area 1B. The Area 1B record provides an English description of a topographic square on the earth. Area 1B record is record 2 of 20, and has the following format:
The Zones are numbered, Area 1A, Area 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3C, 4, 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 6A, 6B, 6C, 7A, 7B, 7C, 8 and 9.
Operation.
Zone and Area stations were configured to broadcast at routine times, on intermediate and high frequencies, with general or individual ship addressed messages, in their own zone of area, respectively. Coastal stations were utilized for the broadcast of messages to merchant ships within range, except at times when broadcast schedules within that zone are in operation. Coastal stations called on the 500 kHz frequency band, and shifted to the working frequency, for the transmission of the BAMS message.
Arranging Authority.
Transmissions of messages for merchant ships via the Zone, Area or Coastal stations are arranged by certain designated shore-based "Arranging Authorities" (AA). These stations read the BAMS "message header" and route the BAMS messages, ensuring it is transmitted by correct Zone and Area stations assigned to them, and by Coastal stations if required. The Arranging Authority also ensures that Coastal stations under their control, transmit messages that are considered necessary, even if the originator does not specify such a transmission.
Originators responsibility.
The originator of a BAMS message is responsible for routing the message to the AA, controlling the Zone and Area stations. In addition, the originator of the BAMS message is responsible for routing to concerned authorities. Routed BAMS messages are only sent to those radio stations whose plotted position covers the area addressed in the BAMS message. An AA may need to know the content of the BAMS dispatch but doesn't require forward routing via the station under its control. In this instance, the message is addressed using the format described in Addressing, described below. In the case of general messages, the Zone and Area station at least would always be utilized and the case of individually addressed messages, the Area station and appropriate Coastal stations would always be utilized.
Routing.
When ships are passing from one area to another, messages which concern them all are routed via the Area stations of both areas and via the appropriate Zone station.
BAMS Procedures.
Operating Signals.
In order to facilitate the handling of BAMS messages, Combined Operating Signals for worldwide use had been allocated as follows:
These procedures signals were used in connection with unenciphered US Navy call signs or combined call signs as appropriate. All transmissions of BAMS messages between naval authorities must carry appropriate procedures signals except where messages are transmitted to radio stations for broadcast where no intermediate relaying station is involved.
BAMS Headings.
A modified commercial procedure is utilized for the addressing of BAMS messages and immediately follows the procedure signals, radio station call signs and station serial number. Component parts of this BAMS heading would always appear in the following order:
BAMS Instructional Group.
The Instructional Group consists of two elements, the first and second letters should be considered together as should the third, fourth and fifth letters, as show in the following table:
The following is an example: Group XY having been assigned, the call sign used to address the whole convoy is XYD3.
The following is an example:
BAMS - All United Nations Merchant Ships
BAMS 2A - All United Nations Merchant Ships in BAMS AREA 2A
Addressing BAMS traffic.
The following lists several examples of BAMS traffic addressing.

Gilles Spifame

Gilles Spifame de Brou, died April 7, 1578 in Paris, was a French prelate of the 16th century.
Gilles Spifame de Brou was the son of Gaillard Spifame, treasurer general of France, and Anne of Marie, as well as the nephew of Jacques Spifame de Brou, bishop of Nevers, whom he succeeds when Jacques converted to the Protestant Calvinists.
Gilles Spifame was a canon and official of Nevers with the title of vicar general, dean of Saint-Marcel of Paris, provost of Chablis, abbot of the abbey Saint-Paul-sur-Vanne and dean of Sens.
He was appointed bishop of Nevers in 1559. Gilles made every effort to stop, as soon as he arrived, the progress of Protestantism in his diocese. After having attended the last sessions of the Council of Trent in 1563, this prelate publicly burned in 1566 three tons of suspicious books sent from Geneva, which Protestants had introduced into Nevers. In 1572 he allowed the Fathers of the Society of Jesus to establish themselves in his episcopal city.

Magong Beiji Temple

Magong Beiji Temple () is a temple in Magong City, Penghu, Taiwan. It mainly serves Xuanwu. Because the location of temple is at the eastern side of ancient Magong city, so Beiji Temple is more widely known as "Dongjia Temple". (東甲宮; pinyin: "dōng jiǎ gōng;" its first character "東 "dong"" means "east"; the next character "甲 "jia"" is "a district unit during Qing Dynasty"; the last character "宮 "gong" is temple.)
History.
The year of establishment is unknown, some said it had existed since the late of Ming dynasty, some said it founded by Zhao Guang (趙廣) in 1690. However, we can confirm that the earliest recording of repair is after 1791 at least.
During the Guangxu years of Qing dynasty, there were three "jia" (甲), a kind of district unit in the past, which distributed over the Magong harbor area, they were "Dongjia" (東甲)", ""Beijia" (北甲)" and ""Nanjia" (南甲)", means "East Jia", "North Jia" and "South Jia" in Chinese.
By tradition, these local residents would serve their own temple in every single Jia. Magong Beiji Temple belongs to the Dongjia area, it is also the most ancient one among those three according to the chorography of Qing dynasty. Beiji Temples mainly serves ""Xuan Tian Shang Di" (Chinese: 玄天上帝)", also known as ""Zhen Wu Shang Di" (Chinese: 真武上帝)" , like other temples in Taiwan, it serves a lot of god statues as well, including Cundi Bodhisattva, Dark Lady, Lord of the Soil and the Ground, Royal Lord and so on.

Beienheim–Schotten railway

The Beienheim–Schotten railway is a railway in the Horloff and the Nidda valleys in the Wetteraukreis in the German state of Hesse. Its western section is also called the "Horlofftalbahn" (Horloff Valley Railway). 
It was built as two different sections, which were connected with each other in Nidda station as well as to the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway, which was opened in 1870:
Since both parts of the line reached Nidda station from the north, trains had to reverse there to continue their journey.
Route.
Beienheim–Nidda.
The line starts in Beienheim station (in Reichelsheim), where it branches from the Friedberg–Mücke railway (which now runs only as far as Wölfersheim). The line runs as far as Reichelsheim through the village of Weckesheim on the south side of and directly next to Landesstraße (state road) 3186/3187 (Weckesheimer Straße and Bad Nauheimer Straße).
In Reichelsheim it turns north and runs parallel to the Horloff through the municipality of Echzell to the south of the village of Ober-Widdersheim (part of Nidda). The local halt of "Häuserhof" is only about 750 metres south of the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway, which this line, which is now again running to the east, runs parallel to but at some distance from until the two lines join at Nidda. After stopping in the spa town of Bad Salzhausen, which is part of the municipality of Nidda, a large right turn takes it to Nidda Station. In the course of this curve, the railway from Gießen and the former continuation of the line to Schotten run to its left.
The entire line from Beienheim to Nidda lies in the Wetterau district of Hesse in the municipalities of Reichelsheim and Echzell and in the town of Nidda.
Nidda–Schotten.
The section to Schotten is the older of the two parts. It was opened in 1888, nine years before the section towards Friedberg, but it was closed and dismantled in 1959/60. In order to save costs and because low traffic volumes were already foreseen during its planning, it was built to technically simple standards. So it followed nearly the entire course of the road from Nidda to Schotten along the valley of the river Nidda, now called federal road 455, usually immediately next to it. The railway operated like a tram in the villages, running directly on the very narrow village streets, which was inconvenient for the residents with its steam operations. Although the line passed through centres of the villages, the stations were built on their outskirts because the narrow roads meant there was no room to build them in the centres.
The Schotten line branched off to the east from the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway at the northern end of Nidda station and runs to the west of the main road on the route of today's Kohdener Weg to the Paradiesstraße / Hoherodskopfstraße intersection and continues on the left (west) side of Hoherodskopfstraße through the village of Kohden. The Kohden halt was located near Ulfaer Weg. Outside Kohden the railway changed to the right (east) side of the road. In the following village of Unter-Schmitten, it was possible to build the line parallel with the village street (Brückenstraße/Vogelsbergstraße) instead of directly along it. In the Brückenstraße/Am Storz area the former route is still recognisable as a path. There was a halt on the northern edge of the village at the "Chausseehaus" inn.
The next village of Ober-Schmitten included two paper mills which were both connected by sidings to the railway. Again, the line had to run directly through the narrow village street. The halt was at its eastern end near the SPO paper mill. Continuing on the right (southeast) side of the road, the line followed the highway to Eichelsdorf and along the village main street to a halt near the townhouse now called Eichelsdorf.
The railway line between Eichelsdorf and Rainrod moved slightly away from the road and crossed it approximately halfway between the two villages. Part of its course can still be recognised as a path. The line also crossed Rainrod near the main street (Frankfurter Straße), but here the halt was on the eastern outskirts, again on the southern side of the road, east of the junction with Brückenstraße. The line ran on the south side of the highway on what is now the northern shore of the Niddastausee reservoir, which was built after the dismantling of the railway, and ended at its terminus in the town of Schotten. The station was between the Nidda river and the present federal highway in the area of the Taubenweg; its goods shed still exists and is used for commercial purposes.
The villages of Kohden, Unter-Schmitten, Ober-Schmitten and Eichelsdorf are now part of Nidda in Wetteraukreis. Rainrod is in the town of Schotten in Vogelsbergkreis.
History.
Beienheim–Nidda.
The line was originally planned and operated by the Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways ("Großherzoglich Hessische Staatseisenbahnen"), which was absorbed into the Prussian-Hessian Railway Company ("Preußisch-Hessische Eisenbahngemeinschaft") in 1897. Construction started on 20 September 1895. The railway was opened on 1 October 1897. The installation of a second track was planned, but never carried out.
Freight traffic used to be significant and was supported by the agriculture of the Wetterau. Of particular note was the sugar beet traffic to the sugar refinery in Friedberg (until 1982). In addition, lignite was transported from Geiß-Nidda between 1904 and 1949. Also the Wölfersheim power plant and salt production in Bad Salzhausen brought traffic to the railway. From 1982 to 1995, around 120,000 tonnes of waste were loaded every year in Grund-Schwalheim. Two trains a day ran to Friedberg and were shunted there for the onward journey. The line had very dilapidated tracks, which meant that parts of it had speed restrictions of 10 to 30 km/h, requiring modernisation.
Nidda–Schotten.
The Nidda–Schotten was opened on 26 May 1888. Because it ran through narrow village streets, the railway was an obstacle for traffic and an accident risk from the first day, which was no longer considered acceptable with the beginning of mass motorisation in the late 1950s. Passenger operations in Schotten and the adjoining villages were therefore formally closed on 29 November 1959. Freight operations continued until February 1960, when it was also abandoned due to lack of demand. The line was dismantled a few months later.
Current operations.
The line is located in the area managed by the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV). It is operated by the Butzbach office of the Hessische Landesbahn, (until 2005, a subsidiary of the Butzbach-Lich Railway Company—"Butzbach-Licher Eisenbahn"). In the peak hour, trains run to/from Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof. Two of these trains are operated as Regional-Express services by DB Regio Mitte with a Bombardier TRAXX locomotive (class 245) hauling double-decker cars and one train is operated from Friedberg towards Nidda by HLB using coupled GTW 2/6 sets. 
Freight traffic plays a minor role as a result of the closure of Wetteraukreis’s waste transhipment point in Grund-Schwalheim and the decline of the wood processing industry in Nidda. However, the Pfleiderer company, which was located in the former Hornitex factory, was still receiving regular deliveries of tank wagons via its siding until its closure in the summer of 2011.

2018 FA Community Shield

The 2018 FA Community Shield (also known as The FA Community Shield supported by McDonald's for sponsorship reasons) was the 96th FA Community Shield, an annual football match played between the title holders of the Premier League and FA Cup. It was contested by Manchester City, champions of the 2017–18 Premier League, and Chelsea, the winners of the 2017–18 FA Cup, at Wembley Stadium in London on 5 August 2018. Manchester City won 2–0, with both goals scored by Sergio Agüero, who was named man of the match for his performance.
Background.
This was Maurizio Sarri's first competitive match in charge of Chelsea; meanwhile, it was Pep Guardiola's second cup final as the manager of Manchester City, following their victory over Arsenal in the 2018 EFL Cup Final.
Manchester City qualified for the competition by winning the 2017–18 Premier League with a record 100 points, the first of any English club in the top-flight since the introduction of the three points for a win rule.
Chelsea were looking to win the Community Shield for the first time since 2009, when they beat Manchester United 4–1 on penalties. They had failed to win any of their last four appearances in the competition. Manchester City had won their last two matches at Wembley, both in 2017–18 – beating Arsenal 3–0 in the EFL Cup Final in February and Tottenham Hotspur 3–1 in the league in April; however, they had not won three consecutive matches at Wembley since March 1970.
The two sides faced each other in the Community Shield once previously, in 2012, a match won 3–2 by Manchester City.

SS Ohio (1875)

SS "Ohio" was a wooden hulled Great Lakes freighter that served on the Great Lakes of North America from her construction in 1875, to her sinking in September 1894 when she collided with the schooner barge "Ironton" which also sank in the collision. "Ironton" was being towed by the steamer "Charles J. Kershaw", which was also towing the schooner "Moonlight". "Ohio" was found upright in 2017, over 122 years after her sinking in over 200 feet of water off Presque Isle, Michigan. "Ironton" is still missing. The researchers who discovered "Ohio" plan to nominate her for a listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
"Ohio" (Official number 19438) was an early wooden bulk carrier. She was built in 1875 by Ohio resident John F. Squires of Huron, Ohio. She was launched in April of 1875. Her hull was long, her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She had a gross tonnage of 1101.81 tons and a net tonnage of 850.82 tons. She was powered by a low pressure condensing engine which was fueled by a single coal-burning Scotch marine boiler. She was used to haul bulk cargoes across the lakes such as iron ore, coal and grain.
Final voyage and sinking.
In September 1894 "Ohio" departed Duluth, Minnesota with a cargo of grain bound for Ogdensburg, New York. This journey took "Ohio" across Lake Superior, through the Soo Locks into Lake Huron, and past Presque Isle and Thunder Bay, Michigan. While on the Lake Huron leg of her journey "Ohio" encountered heavy weather.
The steamer "Charles J. Kershaw" was towing two schooner barges, "Moonlight" and "Ironton". The three vessels were sailing north in rough weather when they saw "Ohio" which was also sailing through rough weather about north of Presque Isle. At the moment when the ships were about to pass each other, the hawser connecting "Ironton" and "Moonlight" snapped causing "Ironton" to veer off course and smash into the side of "Ohio". Both "Ohio" and "Ironton" sank in about half an hour. All sixteen crew members from "Ohio" got into lifeboats and were picked up by "Moonlight". "Ohio" First Mate was found clinging to a ladder and was later picked up by the "Kershaw". The passing steamer "Charles Hebard" picked up two of "Ironton" crew but five of the schooner's crew perished including Captain Peter Girard.
Discovery.
On May 23, 2017, researchers from the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary discovered two shipwrecks deep within the waters of Lake Huron, off the coast of Presque Isle, Michigan. The researchers carried out several investigations between June and August; these investigations confirmed the identities of the steel-hulled steamer "Choctaw" and "Ohio". "Choctaw" was lost on July 11, 1915 when she collided with the package freighter "Wahcondah".
Since the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary did not announce the discovery of "Choctaw" and "Ohio" until September 1, 2017, avocational shipwreck hunters continued to search for "Choctaw" through the summer. While searching for "Choctaw", independent researchers Dan Fountain and Kurt Fosburg found "Ohio" on July 15, 2017 using a modified fishfinder. On July 30 Fountain returned to the site with veteran shipwreck hunters Ken Merryman and Jerry Eliason to image the wreck with Eliason’s homemade hi-definition drop video system, positively identifying the wreck as "Ohio."
While researchers know where the wreck of "Ohio" is, they do not know where the wreck of the "Ironton" rests. According to historical accounts, the "Ironton" sank quickly, and therefore must be near the wreck of "Ohio". They will continue searching until they find her.
"Ohio" today.
The wreck of "Ohio" lies completely preserved in nearly 300 feet of cold fresh water. She sits upright with a list to starboard with her foremast still standing. Her wooden pilothouse with its double helm wheel is completely intact. Near the stern, the mizzen mast is still standing with its topmast broken off. The researchers who discovered her plan to nominate her for a listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

Richard Padmore (1789 – 12 January 1881) was a British Liberal Party politician and industrialist.
Industrial career.
Born in Wellington, Shropshire as the son of Thomas and Mary Padmore, Padmore joined Worcester-based lamppost, tram wire posts and engine supplier Hardy and Co, founded by Robert and John Hardy, in 1820. He became a partner in 1829 and the firm then became known as Hardy and Padmore. This partnership was later dissolved in 1851, with the firm entering voluntary liquidation long after Padmore's death in 1967.
Political career.
Padmore was Worcester's first non-conformist mayor—rejecting a procession to the Cathedral or his place of worship and refusing to wear a mayoral robe—from 1849 to 1849, and from 1852 to 1853 before being elected Liberal MP for Worcester at a by-election in 1860—caused by the resignation of William Laslett. He held the seat until 1868 when he did not seek re-election.

Race Report.
Qualifying.
The #8 Autobacs Racing Team Aguri entry of Tomoki Nojiri and Takashi Kobayashi claimed pole position with the time of 1:20.604. The session itself was filled with attrition, with two red flags as well as varying weather conditions ultimately determining the final part of qualifying. Daisuke Nakajima's best time was erased due to causing a red flag, thereby dropping the #16 Team Mugen entry down to seventh. The other red flag was caused by Kazuki Nakajima, whose best time was also erased; dropping him to eighth.
In the GT300 category, the front-row was locked out by a pair of Mercedes-AMG GT3's, with the #65 K2 R&amp;D LEON Racing entry of Naoya Gamou and Haruki Kurosawa claiming pole position and the #4 Goodsmile Racing &amp; TeamUKYO taking out second. 
Race.
In what was a dominant display by the Lexus brand, the opening round of the Super GT season was won by the Lexus Team KeePer Tom's duo of Ryō Hirakawa and Nick Cassidy. The start was delayed due to several vehicles stopping on the formation lap. One of these included the pole sitting car of Tomoki Nojiri and Takashi Kobayashi. The race was eventually started under safety car conditions. Wasting no time, Cassidy made a bold move down the inside of Kazuya Oshima, locking up both wheels in the process. Shortly thereafter, the #52 Saitama Toyopet Green Brave GT300 entry crashed, bringing out the safety car. After a round of pitstops, the #6 Lexus Team LeMans Wako's entry was catapulted into the lead. A long battle between Andrea Caldarelli and Ryō Hirakawa ensued, which ultimately saw the #37 Lexus Team KeePer Tom's entry emerge victorious.
In the GT300 category, Nobuteru Taniguchi and Tatsuya Kataoka took victory ahead of Haruki Kurosawa and Naoya Gamou, with both Mercedes maintaining the top two spots, albeit in reversed order.

Ponerorchis joo-iokiana

Ponerorchis joo-iokiana is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to norther Korea and Japan (central Honshu).
Description.
"Ponerorchis joo-iokiana" is a herbaceous perennial growing from an ovoid tuber. It reaches a height of 10–30 cm. It has one to three leaves, 4–8 cm long, with bases that surround the stem. The inflorescence consists of a few flowers arranged loosely rather than in a dense spike. Each flower is about 20 mm across, reddish purple overall. The upper (dorsal) sepal is about 10 mm long. The lip or labellum is about 15 mm long, divided into three relatively broad lobes, the middle one being the longest and sometimes further divided. A spur is present, 15–20 mm long, longer than the ovary.
Taxonomy.
"Ponerorchis joo-iokiana" was first described by Tomitaro Makino in 1902, as "Orchis joo-iokiana". It was later transferred to "Chusua" (now a synonym of "Ponerorchis") and then to "Ponerorchis". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2015 suggested that it formed a related group of species with "P. alpestris", "P. kiraishiensis", "P. sichuanica" and "P. chusua" and was not closely related to other "Ponerorchis" species from Japan.
Distribution and habitat.
"Ponerorchis joo-iokiana" is native to the north of Korea and to Honshu in Japan (the Chubu and Kanto regions). In Japan it is found in the subalpine zone, in open grassland.

Suzanne Sarroca (born 21 April 1927) is a 20th-century French operatic soprano.
Biography.
Born in Carcassonne, Sarroca studied singing at the (1946–1948). She began her career as a mezzo-soprano in the role of Charlotte in Massenet's "Werther" in Carcassonne, a role she revived the same year at the Capitole de Toulouse. In 1951 she sang Bizet's "Carmen" at la Monnaie of Brussels.
She then addressed the great roles of lyrico-dramatic soprano: in 1952, she made a remarkable debut at the Paris Opera where she sang at both the Opéra Garnier and the Opéra-Comique:

Abenteuer

Abenteuer (English: "Adventure") is the thirteenth studio album by German schlager singer Andrea Berg. It was released on 30 September 2011 in Germany and soon after in Austria and Switzerland. It marks Berg's second collaboration with Dieter Bohlen.
Background.
Like its predecessor "Schwerelos" (2010), "Abenteuer" was produced by Dieter Bohlen. The songs were composed by Bohlen, who provided Berg with the melodies for her to write lyrics. According to Berg, "Abenteuer" is the first album for which she wrote all the lyrics alone. In the booklet, the singer referred to the development phase of the album as a time "at which life was like shoes [made] of lead" and cites her father's death of cancer in April 2011 as one of the reasons. The song "Seelenverwandt" is dedicated to him. The album title, the German word for "adventure", represents Berg's wish to express that every day is a new chance and a first time.

All tracks on all editions are produced by Dieter Bohlen.

Villains (film)

Villains is a 2019 American black comedy horror film written and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen. It stars Bill Skarsgård, Maika Monroe, Blake Baumgartner, Jeffrey Donovan, and Kyra Sedgwick.
The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 9, 2019. It was released in the United States on September 20, 2019, by Gunpowder &amp; Sky.
Plot.
Wearing animal masks, two lovebirds Mickey and Jules clumsily rob a gas station and take off, celebrating their last sting before moving to Florida. While driving through the woods, their car runs out of gas. Jules spots a mailbox, and the couple discovers a large isolated house. They see a vehicle in the garage but the house appears empty. After breaking down the front door they head down to the basement looking for a gas can, and discover a small girl, dirty and mute, chained to a column.
They return upstairs to find a way to release the girl, but meet the surprised homeowners George, Gloria, and their infant son Ethan. George and Gloria calmly offer money, but Jules is adamant to know why the little girl is downstairs. George explains that their "Sweetiepie" is down there for discipline. Mickey threatens them with his gun, but George diffuses the tension and convinces them to sit down and talk. Mickey keeps his gun cocked while George calmly offers them the chance to simply take their vehicle and leave, stating he would be far less likely to call the police for the car than if they kidnapped Sweetiepie. Micky rejects their offer and backs up Jules' demand to free the girl, forcing George at gunpoint to unlock her.
Free of her chains, Mickey tries to coax and reason with Sweetiepie to come forward, but she bites his hand. George knocks him unconscious, and Gloria restrains Jules. Mickey wakes up tied to a bed with Gloria dancing in front of him in lingerie, but she is upset when he does not get an erection. The next time Gloria visits him, Mickey apologizes. He seduces her and convinces her to uncuff him, and then pushes her away and escapes. As Mickey begins to escape, he recoils from a close gun shot. George shoots again, hitting him in the leg, and ties him up in the basement with Jules. Mickey realizes that he can use Jules' tongue ring to pick the locks on their handcuffs, and after ripping it out, he uncuffs her. Jules attempts to pick the lock of Mickey's cuff, but she breaks her tongue ring and is forced to go for help alone. Sweetiepie points to the laundry chute as an escape.
George realizes Jules has escaped and beats Mickey for information. Mickey lies and tells George that Jules has already left the house and is waiting for Mickey to join her at their meeting spot and she will go to the police if Mickey does not show up in an hour, so George agrees to let Mickey go. Jules hides in Ethan's nursery upstairs, discovering that he is actually a porcelain doll wrapped in a blanket. She overhears Mickey and George talking downstairs and misunderstands their conversation to be as George about to kill Mickey, rather than let him go. Jules uses 'Ethan' as leverage, and coming out onto the landing she threatens to drop the doll, demanding they let Mickey go. An enraged Gloria shoots at her, causing Jules to drop the doll, and its ceramic head shatters on the floor.
The captives are duct taped at the dining table while Gloria cooks a meal. George explains that Gloria has always wanted a child, but he was unable to give her one. They kidnapped Sweetiepie to be their child, but Sweetiepie only reminded Gloria of the children she could never have. Gloria wanted Sweetiepie killed, but George thought locking her in the basement was more merciful. Gloria tells Jules that when she was a little girl, her mother gave her 'Ethan' as a gift and died shortly after. Mickey and Jules begin to feel woozy, having eaten food drugged with what was found in Jules' bag. George explains that he and Gloria will give Mickey and Jules heroin when they pass out, then report them as two drug-addicts who overdosed while robbing them. As Mickey and Jules begin to lose consciousness, a police officer knocks on the door to inform George that the robbers' car was spotted nearby. The officer asks to come in and look around, but the dining room shows no sign of Mickey and Jules, who have been hidden in a bedroom by Gloria. The officer heads down to the basement, but gets called away before seeing Sweetiepie.
Jules awakens from her drug overdose, and after spotting her bag across the room, crawls to it and snorts a bump of cocaine. Regaining her strength, she puts cocaine into Mickey's nostrils to give him a 'boost' and wake him. George and Gloria return, finding the room empty and the window open, head outside to search the surrounding property. Mickey and Jules never left the house and only tricked George and Gloria into thinking they had. They use the opportunity to grab Sweetiepie and take the homeowners car keys. George returns before they can escape, and stands in the driveway with his gun. Mickey warns Jules and Sweetiepie to duck and drives forward, running over George and receiving fatal gunshot wounds in the process. George, injured but alive, pulls Jules out of the car and attempts to strangle her, but Sweetiepie picks up his gun and fatally shoots George through the head. Gloria comes out to see her blood-soaked husband and collapses next to him in maniacal joy, insisting he is just resting and they are about to leave to start a new life. Jules and Sweetiepie set off on foot and hitch a ride to Florida.
Production.
Dan Berk and Robert Olsen's script for "Villains" was featured on the 2016 Black List, an annual list of the most-liked unproduced screenplays of that year. Development began with the casting of Bill Skarsgård and Maika Monroe in the lead roles in March 2018. Two weeks later, Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Donovan joined the cast, and principal photography began that same week in New York City. On April 13, 2018, Donovan posted on Twitter that he had wrapped for "Villains".
Release.
The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 9, 2019. Shortly after, Gunpowder &amp; Sky acquired distribution rights to the film, with the intent to release it in mid-2019. The film was released on September 20, 2019.
Reception.
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 85% approval rating with an average score of 7.5/10, based on 57 reviews. The site's consensus reads, "Led by a quartet of strong performances, "Villains" offers genre fans a delightfully dark thriller with a sharp comic streak."

Ponerorchis kinoshitae

Ponerorchis kinoshitae is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to the south Kuril Islands and northern Japan (Hokkaido, north Honshu).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1903 by Tomitaro Makino as "Gymnadenia keiskei" var. "kinoshitae". In 1909, he raised it to a full species as "Gymnadenia kinoshitae". It was later transferred to other genera, including "Orchis" and "Amitostigma". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis kinoshitae".

Sonja Veselinović

Sonja Veselinović (Serbian-Cyrillic: Соња Веселиновић; born 9 December 1981 in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia) is a Serbian writer and assistant professor of comparative literature at the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Novi Sad.
Biography.
Sonja Veselinović studied comparative literature at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Novi Sad, graduated with Magister degree in 2009 and obtained her doctorate as PhD in 2014. In 2016, she became assistant professor (docent) at the department of comparative literature of the university.
The literary scholar and artist is member of the editorial board of literary magazine Polja (Fields) since 2007. In the same year, she received the first prize of the Festival of Young Poets (Serbian: Festival mladih pesnika) in Zaječar. The best manuscript "Poema preko" (Poem across) was published as book a year later – a "poem across" the way of individual being. The narrator figure (first-person narrative) addresses Marina Tsvetaeva in dealing with the issues of identity, creativity and self-fulfillment. This fragmentary, intertextual and discursive prose searches for the limits of representation of subjectivity through different personas and vivid imagery. An excerpt of the work has been published in Hungarian and German translation. In 2009, she participated in a reading by Denny Rosenthal during the "German Cultural Days Novi Sad", and she was supported by Borislav Pekić Foundation. Belgrade's Goethe-Institute selected her for participation as one of the Serbian artistic representants at the "European Borderlands Festival 2010" of Allianz Cultural Foundation. She was invited guest of the Committee on Cultural and Media Affairs of the German Bundestag in cooperation with the "Brandenburg Gate Foundation" at the Leipzig Book Fair 2011. She is also laureate of the Isidora Sekulić Award 2013 for her prose "Krosfejd". The title is the Serbian term for Crossfade. This prose can be described as mixture (crossfade) of two inner voices of the main character, its fragmented narration, intertextuality and imagery reflects motifs of longing for love and self-knowledge in searching for individual authenticity.
Veselinović compiled the work edition of Ivan V. Lalić for volume 86 of the anthology "Ten Centuries of Serbian Literature" of Matica srpska, and her study on specific topic from a novel of Danilo Kiš (child perspective in Garden, Ashes) has been published in volume 1 of Slavic studies of the University of Graz. The scholar gave a lecture on Yugoslav Black Wave at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg in 2018. So far, in addition to her scientific work, she devoted herself to the translation of few English and French works of John Ashbury, Jean Giraudoux, Milan Kundera and Jacques Rancière into Serbian.
Veselinović supports the protest movement "1 od 5 miliona".
She was member of Jury of "Desanka Maksimović Awards" 2018 and 2019.

Free Palestine Movement

The Free Palestine Movement () is a Palestinian Syrian armed movement and community organization that is led by the businessman Yasser Qashlaq and supports the Ba'athist government of Syria. The organization opposes the existence of Israel, and was mostly known for political activism and social services in favor of Palestinians in Syria and the Gaza Strip before 2012. Upon the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, however, the Free Palestine Movement formed its own militias and has since then openly fought for the Syrian government against various rebel groups.
History.
Early activities.
The Free Palestine Movement was founded by Yasser Qashlaq, a Syria-born Palestinian businessman of considerable wealth who heads several organizations including the Lebanese Institute of International Studies, the Syrian-Palestininan Investment House, the Palestinian Businessmen's Club, and also owns a small Lebanese newspaper. Furthermore, Yasser is known for his antisemitic views, having repeatedly called Jews "dregs of European garbage", a "gang of criminal murderers", and "human pieces of filth" that should be deported to Europe. He has also stated that there is "no reason for coexistence" between Israelis and Palestinians, as the latter would reclaim their lands and "hunt [the Israelis] down to the end of the world, and prosecute them for their massacres". Though close to the Syrian government, Yasser has denied any links with Hezbollah.
When Yasser first became politically active in the Palestinian Yarmouk Camp of Damascus in 2003, he consequently presented himself as supporting the Second Intifada. Since then, he organized the Free Palestine Movement as community organization which provided social services for Palestinians in Syria and rallied support for the Baa'athist government. Atlantic Council expert Tom Rollins also argued that the organization serves as "vehicle for [Yasser Qashlaq's] political ambitions". According to Qashlaq, the Free Palestine Movement took part in organizing the Freedom Flotilla II for the Gaza Strip in 2010/11.
Syrian Civil War.
After the Syrian Civil War's start, the Free Palestine Movement began to recruit for pro-government militias and founded its own paramilitary wing, the "Al-Aqsa Shield Forces" in 2012. The Al-Aqsa Shield Forces mostly operate in Damascus, especially after an informal power-sharing agreement between the Free Palestine Movement and Fatah al-Intifada, another pro-government militia, in 2016. According to this agreement Yasser Qashlaq paid Fatah al-Intifada a substantial sum for handing over parts of their frontline at the Yarmouk Camp to the Free Palestine Movement. In consequence, Yasser and his movement could gain "valuable political capital" as defenders of Yarmouk which is of great symbolic importance to the Palestinian diaspora, while Fatah al-Intifada got much-needed funds. Since then, the Free Palestine Movement mostly fought the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants in Yarmouk Camp, notably participating in the Southern Damascus offensives of March and April and May 2018. In the latter operation the organization's military commander, Saed Abd Al-Aal, was wounded in combat. Fighters of the Free Palestine Movement have also fought in other areas of Damascus, including at Harasta in August 2017 and at al-Shaghour during the Rif Dimashq offensive of early 2018.
Though the Free Palestine Movement's activity is mostly concentrated in Damascus, the organization is known to have committed forces to fronts in other regions of Syria as well. In a notable incident in May 2013, the "Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni Battalions", another armed group affiliated with the movement, fired two mortar shells at Israel Defense Forces positions on Mount Hermon. This was reportedly done in commemoration of Nakba Day. Troops of the Free Palestine Movement also operated in Hama in late 2017, and fought in the Battle of Deir ez-Zor (September–November 2017).
After the Yarmouk Camp was fully secured by government forces in May 2018, some locals started to burn down their own houses to prevent them from being looted. In response, the Free Palestine Movement declared that these people would have to account for their actions, and that it would try to prevent further burnings. The group, along with as-Sa'iqa and Fatah al-Intifada, also started to lay off many of its fighters due to the decreasing need for them and lack of funds. Commander Saed Abd Al-Aal denied this, however, and claimed that the Free Palestine Movement had simply redeployed its fighters from Damascus to other war zones. When an Irish parliamentary delegation visited Yarmouk Camp in late July 2018 to evaluate the damage caused by the years-long combat, it was accompanied by Saed Abd Al-Aal. The Free Palestine Movement took part in a festival in honor of Yasser Arafat on 11 November 2018.
At some point in early 2019, the Free Palestine Movement sent detachments to take part in counter-insurgency operations in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, and contributed troops to the Northwestern Syria offensive (April–August 2019). In course of the latter campaign, its troops fought at Halfaya and al-Zakah. In October 2019, a FPM member was shot dead by unknown assailants in Da'el. Meanwhile, the FPM continued to demobilize fighters due to a lack of funds. From late 2019, the party's troops took part in the government's Northwestern Syria offensive (December 2019–March 2020). Around the same time, the Free Palestine Movement was also active in Latakia Governorate, where one of its fighters was killed at Salma.
After the Northwestern Syria offensive's conclusion, the Free Palestine Movement continued to be active in Idlib, where it held border posts at the frontline. In February 2020, seven members of the group were killed during clashes in the region.
Organization.
The Free Palestine Movement is officially led by Yasser Qashlaq, while Saed Abd Al-Aal serves as the commander of the organization's paramilitary wing. The armed forces of the Free Palestine Movement have been described as "rag-tag militia" and include the Saraya Bader, the Al-Aqsa Shield Forces as well as the Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni Battalions. Like other pro-government militias in Syria, the Free Palestine Movement reportedly attracts new recruits with relatively high monthly salaries, as many young Syrian Palestinians are in precarious economic conditions due to the civil war and mass unemployment. By November 2018, 24 fighters had died while fighting in the Syrian Civil War for the FPM.
Alleged criminal activities and war crimes.
According to the pro-opposition site Zaman AlWasl and other investigators, two (ex-)members of the Free Palestine Movement, namely Mofeq AlDaouah and Mahmoud Arnaout, were involved in war crimes during the Syrian Civil War. They allegedly targeted and killed civilians during the Siege of Yarmouk Camp. In addition, Zaman AlWasl accused Mofeq of several cases of rape in Yarmouk Camp. According to local activists, the Free Palestine Movement is also involved in criminal business schemes which pressured residents of Yarmouk Camp to sell property under value to make way for a major reconstruction plan of the cityscape.
Mofeq was arrested by the German police in Berlin on 4 August 2021. He is accused of having fired an anti-tank weapon into a crowd of civilians, who were waiting for UN food handouts on 23 March 2014 in Yarmouk Camp. At least seven people were killed in the attack.

Rytíři Grálu

Rytíři Grálu is a 1996 Czech adventure video game.
Production.
The game was the first Czech attempt at the dungeon crawler video game format. "Root.cz" asserted that it was the first serious Czech video gaming project to be successful in terms of commercial sales.
Plot and gameplay.
The narrative is based on the story of Excalibur. In this game, Arthur returns without his sword and "gets sick".

Bill Snow

William Snow otherwise known as Bill or Billy was an anti-smoking activist, a co-founder of BUGA UP (Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions) and contributor to the banning of tobacco advertising and the realisation of a smoke-free environment in Australia. In addition to his anti-smoking activities, he was an avid campaigner against nuclear weapons and destruction of the environment and was a strong supporter of Aboriginal Rights. Bill died of a ruptured aorta after a short painful episode on 8 March, 2018. He is survived by his daughter Emily and his sisters Dorothy and Joan.
Early life.
Bill was born on 31 January 1938, the youngest of Alison and Lyall Snow's three children. He grew up in Drummoyne and attended Fort Street High School where he won an award for debating and graduated with the leaving certificate. Billy began work as a printer’s mechanic and rebelled against his strict Salvation Army upbringing by immersing himself in the early Rock 'n' Roll scene. After a period of National Service he took off for a decade long adventure of sailing and backpacking around the world. He sailed through SE Asia and the Mediterranean and travelled the length of the Americas, working as a printer in Japan, London and San Francisco. He met Rosemarie Gosling in London in 1964; they set off to Europe together and married in Sydney in 1967. Their daughter Emily was born in 1972. After separating from his wife Bill moved to Bundeena, a village within Sydney’s Royal National Park, in 1979.
Whilst in Bundeena Bill was contracted by the University of Sydney to print testamurs for graduating students and acquired a hand-operated letterpress printing machine to print them. This printing method was preferred because the typed letters were embossed into the paper. Bill continued to print the testamurs until the technology was superseded by laser printing in the 1990s. 
Cigarette advertising and smoking.
Bill Snow was one of Australia's early environmental and fresh air campaigners. When a fellow anti-smoking campaigner, Brian McBride, sued a bus driver for assaulting him with tobacco smoke on a non-smoking bus, Bill and Gayle Russell came forward in his support. This action led to the formation of the Non-Smokers Rights Movement in 1978, later to become the Non Smokers Movement of Australia.
Frustrated at the lack of action on tobacco he began to write graffiti on tobacco billboards in 1977, which were more than half the outdoor advertising at that time. In 1978 Simon Chapman, and others involved in public health who, concerned about tobacco advertising, formed a group called MOP UP (Movement Opposed to the Promotion of Unhealthy Products) but after the meeting Bill, Geoff Coleman and Ric Bolzan decided that direct action would be more effective using satire on billboards, linked by the simple words BUGA UP (Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions). The idea was that anyone could see the concept, pick up a spray can and contribute to the war against tobacco promotion and disease. A blank billboard was found, the acronym was painted and publicised with a catalogue illustrated with photographed billboards and leaflets, but the most powerful message was sprayed by people on many billboards.
Bill travelled in his van with 'BUGA UP Rules OK' painted on the front, while rainbows and dolphin motifs were painted on the sides by his partner and fellow graffitist Danielle Kluth. This mobile display helped to publicise his environmental causes. He drove around with spray cans and a bucket with paint bombs floating in it, just in case they were required. He probably re-faced more billboards than anyone else, with the possible exception of Fred Cole, but he was not one to rush a job. He could linger at a billboard for half an hour, using his printer’s eye to ensure his alterations were ‘perfect’. Needless to say, he was arrested on numerous occasions and spent time in gaol 'on principle' rather than pay a fine. 
His anti-smoking actions took many forms, for example he collected cigarette butts from sacred sites and elsewhere, put them in large plastic bottles with labels like ‘Collected at Ayers Rock (Uluru) with information about how much damage they did to wildlife, and set up displays at fairs and schools to increase awareness and encourage action against tobacco and environmental pollution. He was an engaging character, though not always tactful and sometimes plain cantankerous. He would confront tobacco company salespeople and other representatives and then engage them about the error of their ways. His van was used as a 'BUGA UP Embassy' outside Leo Burnett’s (tobacco) Advertising Agency in North Sydney in 1984. In order to get rid of the 'Embassy' the Police had to impound the van but waited in vain for the registered owner, 'Philip Morris', to claim it.
Favouring preventive action at all levels, he would visit Police stations with leaflets and explain to the somewhat startled officers that BUGA UP was to be active in their area and it would be appreciated if the health activists were just allowed to get on with the job. Despite this he was arrested and spent time in gaol for his billboard graffiti, as naturally he refused to pay the fine. But the fact that this happened made BUGA UP the most radical health promotion group in the world, which served to make all other anti-tobacco actions moderate, and re-frame the debate globally. Australia was the first major country to ban tobacco advertising and the loss of legitimacy by the tobacco industry had huge implications for tobacco and health policy in Australia and worldwide.
Political activism.
Bill was an avid campaigner against nuclear energy and destruction of the environment. He put his sailing skills to good use in seaborne protests against nuclear armed warships from the United States sailing into Sydney Harbour.
He was a great believer in community action and was an early supporter of the Bundagen Community on the mid North Coast. Bill also spent much time with Indigenous Australians and visiting their communities. He funded a trip to England with Burnum Burnum in 1988, Australia's Bicentennial Year, when Burnum Burnum planted the Aboriginal flag on the beach near the white cliffs of Dover and claimed Britain for the Aboriginal people, as the British had done to the Aboriginal people in Australia.

Anniston Manufacturing Company

The Anniston Cotton Manufacturing Company was a cotton mill which operated from 1880 to 1977.
Its three building complex at 215 W. Eleventh St. in Anniston, Alabama, built in 1880, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, as "Anniston Cotton Manufacturing Company". It has also been known as Chalk Line, Inc.
The site was deemed "significant as an example of the spirit of industrialization that grew in the New South following the War Between the States. Built for Anniston's two leading industrialists, Samuel Noble and Alfred Tyler, as a companion industry to the city's growing iron industry and as a source of employment for the wives and children of iron workers, the mill was the first textile mill built in town. The mill also had one of the longest periods of operation of any textile mill within the state, beginning in February 1881 and continuing until its closing in 1977."
Also, "The Anniston Cotton Manufacturing Company building is significant architecturally for the quality of the Italian Renaissance Revival design as used in an industrial building from the period and as one of the oldest extant examples of a cotton mill building in Alabama."
The main building was a three-story brick building.
The complex was demolished as of April 2014, and then became the site of the Calhoun County Human Resources Department.

Jephté Guillaume is a Haitian-born DJ, bassist, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist from Brooklyn whose signature Haitian folk song-infused house music was signed and promoted by the New York-based Spiritual Life Music brand. His Tèt Kale sound combines acoustic grooves with electronica.
Career.
From 1994 to present, Guillaume has released two albums and about two dozen singles.
Joe Claussell's Spiritual Life label released Guillaume's debut album "Voyage of Dreams" in 1999 in the US but the album had already been released in France and Japan since 1998. The release was noted by "Billboard" magazine. Critics such as the "Washington Post" noted the boldness of a double disc debut album sung entirely in Haitian Creole, mixing house and rich orchestra instrumentation.
In the summer of 1999, Guillaume and his Tèt Kale orchestra appeared in a Body &amp; Soul house party and performance co-sponsored by HMV records at Central Park Summerstage. The event had been put together by resident Body &amp; Soul DJ's Claussell, François Kevorkian and Danny Krivit. Its goal was to showcase the budding multicultural New York house scene, integrating DJ/club culture with world music from Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. 12,000 people attended and Guillaume's picture singing onstage wearing loose all-white clothing reminiscent of a vodou priest and a Haitian peasant hat, arms open wide, guitar hanging across his body, appeared in "Billboard" magazine's piece on the event. An announcement for the event had appeared in "The New York Times" Pop and Jazz guide, calling it a "brave experiment".
Guillaume's music inspired Claussell's own album and Guillaume was part of a team associated with Claussell who worked together on many productions.
In October 1999, Guillaume opened at Irving Plaza for a Zap Mama concert reviewed by "The New York Times". The performance exhibited Haitian Vodou dance, drumming and chanting and showcased songs from his album "Voyage of Dreams". "The Times" noted the African, Haitian traditional rhythms, Afro beats and house influences.

Gregory of Langres

Gregory of Langres, also called Gregory of Autun, was a Gallo-Roman prelate, born around 446, count of Autun, in Saone-et-Loire then once widowed, towards 500, he becomes bishop of Langres, from 506 to his death in 539.
Descendant of a rich family of Senators, he was count and governor of Autun and Autunois. After the death of his uncle Attale, Count of Autun, he took over the county. History retains the memory of a man firm and severe, but fair. He was ruthless to cowards and bandits, kind and gentle with good people. We know of two sons of his union with Armentaire (Armentaria), daughter of Armentarius, senator of Lyons. One is called Tetricus and will be his successor to the Episcopal See of Langres.
The second son also named Gregory, will be the grandfather of the famous Gregory of Tours.
Once a widower, he goes to the orders. The chronicler tells us that he was elected in 506 by the clergy and the faithful of Langres to the episcopal see. It is about this date that he founded the abbey Saint-Bénigne of Dijon and made place the relics of this apostle of Burgundy in the basilica. He sent for religious and gave them for abbot Eustade. He was an exemplary shepherd, indulging in abstinence with great rigor, eating only bread made with barley, using only water diluted with water and spending long hours in prayer. Living "like an anchorite in the middle of the world," according to Gregory of Tours, his great-grandson.
He made frequent trips to Dijon, which at that time depended on the diocese of Langres. He lived near the baptistery of Saint Vincent, near the Saint-Etienne church. It was a place with many relics, where he came to pray at night. The legend tells us that one of the clerics watching him one day saw the revered saints coming to sing and glorify God with him. Saint Benigne would have let him know that he was quite mourned that his cult was neglected. He immediately renews the shrine of the martyr.
It was in his day that Sigo, who would be canonized under the name of St. Seine, came to the Abbey of Reome, under the spiritual direction of Jean of Reome.
He ordered the translation of the relics of Saint Benigne, and build the church and the abbey of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon which serve as their tomb.

latter the blue-spotted submarginal band is absent, being replaced by a row of rounded or partly quadrangular
black spots, also the underside of the hindwing exhibiting some essential differences, so that the specific distinctness
appears to be established. — Central and West China (June, July).

Norwich City Council v Harvey

Norwich City Council v Harvey is a 1989 English law case on the waiver of liability in negligence.
Facts.
After inviting tenders, the plaintiff, Norwich CC, engaged a contractor to build an extension to their swimming pool complex. 
Clause 20A in the contract declared that the works were at the sole risk of Norwich CC, as regards loss or damage by fire; and that Norwich CC would arrange adequate insurance cover against those risks. Presumably Norwich CC wanted to ensure that the insurance was "in their own hands", and it also meant that the contractors could exclude insurance costings from their tender.
The contractor engaged a sub-contractor to carry out felting work on the new roof. An employee of the subcontractor used a blow-torch carelessly and set fire to both the existing buildings and the new extension, causing extensive damage. Norwich CC's insurer was reluctant to bear the cost of the loss, arguing that the negligent party should be liable instead.
Decision.
Although the subcontractor was indeed negligent, being in breach of the duty of care established in "Donoghue v Stevenson" 1921, the Court of Appeal held that it was clearly intended that the employer should bear the whole risk of damage by fire, including fire caused by the negligence of the contractor or of any subcontractors, especially as the contractors had responded to Clause 20A by omitting insurance costings in their tenders.
Clause 20A was thus effectively a waiver saying that in the event of fire damage Norwich CC (rather than other parties) would be deemed liable for any loss; so Norwich CC was estopped from claiming otherwise.

The Commanding Officer of HMS "St George" when it was commissioned was Captain F.S. Bell with Captain A.J. Lowe being officer in charge of Ballakermeen School. A staff of over 300 officers would provide cadets with practical and technical training. Classroom work at Ballakermeen was supplemented by instructional films and technical experiments. Separate classrooms were allocated for cadets of different branches of the service, each class consisting of approximately 25–30 cadets.
During the course of the war, 8,677 cadets passed their training at HMS "St George".
HMS "St George" was paid off on Thursday December 20, 1945, with the officers and ratings leaving the Isle of Man and relocating to HMS "Ganges", Shotley.

Tau Cross (band)

Tau Cross is a rock band founded by Rob Miller of England's Amebix.
Controversy.
Tau Cross' third album, "Messengers of Deception", was originally scheduled for release on August 9, 2019, via Relapse Records. In July 2019, however, Relapse chose to sever its relationship with the band and cancel the album's release due to Miller's inclusion of Gerard Menuhin, a Holocaust denier, in his thanks list, submitted to the label in the late stages of production. Shortly thereafter the other four members of the band issued a joint statement expressing their lack of previous knowledge about, and desire not to be associated with, Menuhin's work and Miller's interest in it. Within a week Miller had dismissed guitarist Andy Lefton and drummer Michel Langevin and made an ambivalent public statement about the status of the remaining members, expressing his resolve to continue the band alone if necessary. Miller eventually self-released the album in December 2020, after resurfacing with a new lineup for the band.
Musical style.
Tau Cross' musical style is primarily described as crust punk, punk rock and heavy metal, with many critics referring to it as a continuation of the style of Miller's previous band Amebix The band have also been described as alternative rock, gothic rock, traditional doom metal, post-punk, progressive rock and thrash metal and industrial. Citing influences such as Killing Joke, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Joy Division and 16th century English mysticism, their music has also been compared to the work of Motörhead, Prong and New Model Army.

Nicolls' Outpost

Nicolls' Outpost was the smaller and more northern of two forts built by British Lt. Col. Edward Nicolls during the War of 1812. (The Americans referred to it as Fort Apalachicola. Built at the end of 1814, together with the larger "British post" or storage depot down the Apalachicola, it was "the northernmost post built by the British during their Gulf Coast Campaign". It was just below the Spanish Florida–Georgia border, where the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers meet to form the Apalachicola, in River Landing Park in modern Chattahoochee, Florida. Even though what was built was smaller than the much larger British post down the Apalachicola, it was intended to be the base, presumably enlarged, for an English invasion of the United States, and British post was to have been its supply depot. The 1815 end of the War of 1812 aborted this project.
It was built atop the largest of three surviving mounds of the prehistoric Fort Walton culture. Above the winter flood stage of the Apalachicola, it could reach both forks of the river with cannon fire. It was built in 1814 and abandoned early in 1815, at the end of the war. It was armed with a -inch howitzer. It also had a coehorn, a mortar that could fire 24-pound shells. According to a report of U.S. Colonel and Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins, there were "200 troops white and black and an assemblage of 500 [Creek] Warriors", "well supplied with cloth[e]s and munitions of War". The intention was to mount an expedition "up the river" (the Flint), bringing the cannon along. Georgia militia, other U.S. forces, and the faction of the Creek allied with the U.S. (the Lower Creeks) were preparing upriver (in Georgia) for a battle. News of the treaty ending the war (Treaty of Ghent), which reached both sides in February 1815, prevented the battle from taking place. The British abandoned both of its forts on the Apalachicola, leaving them in the hands of the black Corps of Colonial Marines that Nicolls had trained, and of Red Stick Creek Neamathla and his warriors.
Council of 1815.
Before abandoning the Fort, an important council (meeting) took place there on March 10, 1815. The meeting was between Red Stick Creek leaders Neamathla, Francis the Prophet (Josiah Francis), Peter McQueen, and more than 30 other Native Americans, and Lt. Col. Nicolls and four other British officers, passing through on their way to British ships to return them to other British colonies (Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad) or to England. "The council included representatives from towns or groups of Lower Creeks, Red Sticks, Miccosukee, Alachua, Yuchi and Choctaw. Languages spoken included Hitchiti, Yuchi, and Choctaw. In short, a wide range of cultures was combining into the group that we know today as Seminoles." In retrospect, this was the founding of the Seminoles, a loose alliance of various groups of Native American refugees in Spanish Florida, although they did not set up a central authority, which was "extremely difficult for the United States military to understand. ... The political and social complications at play in the developing Seminole Nation were utterly incomprehensible to American settlers and officials." The person who did understand them, Indian agent Hawkins, died in 1816.
The Treaty of Ghent stated that Native Americans were to be restored "all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811". The meeting was to point out to the British that having assisting them, the Creeks faced even greater hostility from the Americans. They claimed to be subjects of Britain, and asked British assistance in recovering their lands.
Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost.
The most important outcome of the meeting was the little-known Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost. In it, the Creeks promised allegiance to Great Britain, which in turn accepted them as subjects of the British empire. The hope was that Britain would provide them with protection against the United States, so they could recover the land taken since 1811, more specifically that taken in the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which they, the Red Stick Creeks, had not signed and which, they claimed, did not apply to them. Nicolls, a champion of Native American rights, created this treaty on his own initiative, without authorization.
The outcome was the famous trip of Francis the Prophet to London, together with Nicolls, to seek "recognition and assistance" from Great Britain. The British government, in no way interested in further conflict with the United States, summarily rejected the Treaty, sent Francis home, and chastised Nicolls.

Prokletí Eridenu

Prokletí Eridenu (English: "Curse of Eriden") is a 1997 Czech dungeon-crawler video game developed by Napalm Soft and published by Zima Software for DOS.
Production.
The title was released quite late for its genre, coming out at the very end of the dungeon era. In 1999, a full version of the Eriden Curse has been downloadable free of charge from the Internet.
Plot and gameplay.
The story takes place in the ruins of the mysterious, cursed city of Eriden, in the dungeons below the hero must destroy four magic mirrors. The player controls one character out of a choice of nine - each has three basic attributes - strength, mana, and health. Like in Dungeon Master, there are also hunger and thirst game mechanics for the main character.
Critical reception.
The game received negative reviews, garnering a 40% from Level and a 30% from Score. Root.cz felt the title fell into the category of somewhat less successful (but interesting) games. High Voltage wrote that the game had a reputation for a terrible dueling system, ragged level design, and sterile graphics. In contrast, Bonuzweb.cz highly praised the game's automapping feature and the well illustrated fights with enemies.

The two music tracks and the sound effects were produced by Rob Hubbard. "Crazy Comets" was followed by a 1987 sequel, also programmed by Nicol, "Mega Apocalypse".
Reception.
"Zzap!64" praised the game for being an uncomplicated example of the genre. "Happy Computer" said the music alone was worth the price of admission.

Laylat al-Raghaib

Laylat al-Raghaib or Regaip Kandili, also known as the "Night of Wishes", is one of the five blessed Kandil nights in Islam. Raghaib is derived from the root "ra-gha-ba" meaning "to desire" or "to tend toward". Laylat al-Raghaib marks the beginning of the "Three holy months" (Rajab, Sha'ban and leading to Ramazan) in the Hijri calendar. As Islamic holidays begin the night before, Laylat al-Raghaib is celebrated on the Thursday night preceding the first Friday of the month of Rajab. Followers of this tradition believe that if, on the first Thursday of Rajab, they recite a special set of prayers, they will be rewarded by the fulfillment of their wishes.
The tradition is based on the oft-quoted passage attributed to Muhammad:
 "It is most important, however, that none of you should neglect the first Thursday night in Rajab, for it is the night that the angels call the Night of Wishes. This is because, by the time the first third of the night has elapsed, there will not be a single angel still at large in the heavens, nor in any region of the earth bar one. They will all be gathered together in the Ka'ba and the area immediately surrounding it. Allah will condescend to notice that they have assembled there, and He will say: 'My angels, ask Me for whatever you wish!' Their response to this will be: 'Our Lord, the request we wish to make is that You grant forgiveness to those who faithfully keep the fast in Rajab,' whereupon Allah will tell them: 'That I have already done!"'

Jose Flores (jockey)

Jose Luis Flores (August 4, 1960 – March 22, 2018) was a Peruvian jockey who spent most of his career in the United States, where he was a leading rider at race tracks in Pennsylvania.
Life and career.
Flores was born and apprenticed as a rider in Peru, where his father was also a jockey. 
Starting in 1983 he raced in Panama at the , winning 211 races. He moved to the United States in 1987, first to Miami and then to Pennsylvania, where he was the leading rider at Penn National Race Course in Grantville, Pennsylvania four times before changing in the late 1990s to Philadelphia Park, now Parx Casino and Racing, where he became the highest-earning jockey in the history of the track. In 2013 he was inducted into the Parx Hall of Fame.
He won 4,650 races out of 28,684, among the 42 winningest careers in North America, and placed in 7,975. In 1999 he won the Philadelphia Park Breeders' Cup Handicap on Loaded Gun. In his most successful year, 1987, he won 380 races out of 1,694. Since the mid 2010s his career had been slowed by injuries; his last win was on March 13, 2018.
Death.
On March 19, 2018, Flores was in the lead in a race at Parx when his mount, Love Rules, fell with a suspected shoulder fracture and he was thrown. Two other horses and their riders also fell but were not seriously injured; one horse may have fallen on Flores, who incurred grave head and spinal injuries and died on March 22 after being taken off life support. It was the first death known to the Jockeys' Guild of a jockey in Pennsylvania caused by a racing accident.
"He's been a mentor to other riders and a professional gentleman at all times. He's the epitome of what a jockey should be" is what Sam Elliott, Director of Racing at Parx, said about Jose Flores.
Personal life.
Flores was married to Joanne McDaid-Flores, herself a jockey from 2004 to 2016, and has three sons, two grown.

Rupilia gens

The gens Rupilia, occasionally written Rupillia, was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in the latter part of the Republic, and Publius Rupilius obtained the consulship in 132 BC. Few others achieved any prominence, but the name occurs once or twice in the consular fasti under the Empire. The name is frequently confounded with the similar "Rutilius".
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Rupilii were "Publius" and "Lucius", two of the most common names throughout Roman history.
Branches and cognomina.
None of the Rupilii bore cognomina under the Republic, but as with other plebeian families most of them had individual surnames in imperial times.

Pest Infestation Control Laboratory

The Pest Infestation Control Laboratory was a government-run laboratory in Slough during the Second World War and for some years after it, conducting research into food security.
History.
The field station was first established in 1929 by the Imperial College of Science and Technology on the Hurworth Estate; it was the college's first such field station and was located one mile east of Slough. However, pest research had already gained the interest of the Empire Marketing Board, and in the late 1930s the Grain Infestation Survey Committee was set up. In 1938, Sir William Beveridge was asked by the British government to make preparations for securing food supplies in the case of war, and he asked for the help of Professor James Munro at Imperial College. Munro believed a significant problem was insect infestations in grain stores, which went unreported, and he recommended "an intrusive examination of food stores". An entomologist in Munro's Stored Products Research Laboratories, Geoffrey Herford, was given the task of conducting a grain survey. On 1 April 1940, the Imperial College field station at Slough became the Pest Infestation Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and Herford was appointed as its Director. He remained in charge until March 1968.
After the Second World War, some staff at the unit moved to Silwood Park, which is the rural campus of Imperial College, where work was carried out on chemical insecticides.
In February 1984, the government set up the Crops Protection Committee, which later found that up to 10% of stored grain was at risk from pest infestation. Fumigation was the most popular way to eradicate pests.
Function.
It carried out research on attacks by fungal and insect pests on harvested crops, to help farmers implement pest control strategies. The laboratory studied the life history, habits and physiology of pests (mainly insects). Insecticides that would limit insect population, or eradicate them, were studied, such as by fumigation. It worked largely with biologists and chemists at Imperial College, including the zoologists Octavius Lubatti and Albert Page.
In the 1980s it carried out research on the "indestructible" Pharaoh ant, by looking at analogue hormones.
Structure.
The main site was at the Slough Biological Field Station, partly run by the Ministry of Food. The Infestation Control Division was built at Tolworth.

Samantha Fox Strip Poker

Samantha Fox Strip Poker is a 1986 erotic video game developed by Software Communications and published by Martech. It was published on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, MSX, and ZX Spectrum.
It is one of the first erotic video games to include a real human being. It is part of a theme of erotic games where players complete difficult tasks and are rewarded with nudity.
Gameplay.
The players plays 5-card or 7-card stud poker against British model and singer Samantha Fox. Winning hands results in her taking off her clothes until she is topless.
Development.
The video game was programmed by Wolfgang Smith, with the graphics edited by Malcolm Smith. The author of the music is Rob Hubbard, credited with the name John York. The music includes a cover of "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin and "The Stripper" by David Rose.
Reception.
"ZZap!64" felt the music was well-suited to the style of game. "Commodore Format" magazine thought that the idea of anybody using the game as a way to experience titillating content was depressing due to the required amount of effort from the player. 
Uvejuegos thought the game was a prime example of how strange the 1980s were. Spiegel placed the game within the sub-genre of early pixelated digi-ladies of dubious beauty, along with Artworx's "Strip Poker" (1984).

Church of St John the Baptist, Bishop's Tawton

The Church of St John the Baptist is the Anglican parish church for the village of Bishop's Tawton in Devon. The church has been a Grade I listed building since 1965 and comes under the Diocese of Exeter.
History.
Several sources dating from the 16th and 17th centuries record that the see of the first bishop for Devon (a diocese created by dividing the Diocese of Sherborne in the early 10th century) was at Tawton (later named Bishop's Tawton) in 905, though certainly by 909 the see was at Crediton. (In 1050 the see moved to Exeter.) Any link between a possible 10th-century former bishop's church/cathedral and the extant Church of St John the Baptist is conjectural. The case for a brief bishopric at Tawton is far from proved, but there are remains of a modest bishop's "palace" at Court Farm, next to the church. This residence was used for centuries by the diocesan bishops, until Tudor times, and the parish was a bishop's peculiar.
Building.
This small church is built of stone rubble, roughly coursed to the North aisle and with squared rubble to the chancel and ashlar dressings. The tower and probably also the nave are 14th-century with the latter being remodelled in the 15th-century when the North aisle was added. The North aisle was restored in 1849, the chancel was rebuilt in 1864 while further general restoration took place between 1878 to 1882, all by local architect R.D. Gould. The remainder of the present building is mostly 15th-century and was built on the site of a medieval chapel. The tower is unique in Devon in that it has a crocketed 14th-century octagonal spire. The first recorded Rector was John de Okehampton in 1285, though nothing remains of the church building from this time. Over the years numerous improvements have been made including adding a south doorway, a choir vestry, a brass eagle lectern, stained glass windows and a 19th-century Bath stone pulpit. The nave is separated from the aisles by three bays with leaf capitals and an additional half bay which opens into the tower. The rood screen is 15th-century and not well preserved. The baptismal font is 18th-century. The reredos consists of glazed tiles in "robust Victorian colours".
The adjacent war memorial is a Grade II listed building. Carved in dressed granite, it is a copy of St Martin’s Cross in Iona in Scotland and is dedicated to the members of the Bishop's Tawton Parish who died in World War I; it was unveiled and dedicated by the Revd. P.L. Nicholas in September 1920.
Monuments and memorials.
There are some very fine memorials to the Chichester Family of Hall in Bishop's Tawton. In the chancel is that of Lady Ursula Chichester (died 1635) depicted as the usual kneeling figure. The memorial to the infant daughter of Charels (sic) and Rose Dart (1652) has a tiny effigy of the swaddled child beneath the inscription. Other memorials include those to Sir Francis Chichester (1628-1698), Sir John Chichester (1598-1669), and a tomb slab in a recess to Anna Chichester (died 1644).

Strip Poker (video game series)

Strip Poker is a series of erotic video games developed by Artworx. It ran from 1982–1995 over five games. The player is a presumed male who plays strip poker against attractive women. The games received generally positive reviews over the series history. Critics appreciated the game's sense of humour and for effectively using their limited graphics to create titillating imagery. Others felt that a video game was a depressing way for players to view such content, when alternatives like "Playboy" were available.
Gameplay.
The player, a male poker player, plays a card game against the computer who is represented by an attractive woman. As the player beats the woman in the game, she proceeds to take off items of clothing as a reward. The core models in the series are Suzi and Melissa. Other characters are available in certain games through expansion packs.
Development.
In the original game, Douglas McFarland did the graphics while Mitch Garnaat did the coding. In "Strip Poker II", graphics are by Douglas McFarland, with programming by both McFarland and Mitch Garnaat.
It was reported Karen Graham, one of the developers, was looking for male models for a version targeted at the female gamer. When asked potential controversy, Graham said that while they were bound to receive complaints with the title, the male version planned for 1988 would have evened things out. It was never released.
Release.
"Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance" was released in 1982 on Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 16, Plus/4, Commodore 64, and IBM PC. "Strip Poker II" (aka "Deluxe Strip Poker") was released in 1988 for Amiga, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, and IBM PC Compatibles. Anco handled European publishing while Artworx handled the American market. "Strip Poker II" was augmented by "Strip Poker II+" and "Strip Poker II" data disks.
"Strip Poker Professional" and "Strip Poker Professional: Rev B" were released on MS-DOS in 1994 and 1995 respectively.

Marx Returns

Marx Returns is the debut novel by the British writer and filmmaker Jason Barker. It tells the story of the German philosopher Karl Marx and his struggle to complete his magnum opus "Capital".
Reception.
Reviewing "Marx Returns" in the "Los Angeles Review of Books", Nina Power described it as "an imaginative, uplifting, and sometimes disturbing alternative history". Writing for "The Australian", Peter Beilharz declared that "The story that Barker tells is incredibly witty, clever, and creative. It is amusing and entertaining as well as instructive."
Barker discussed his novel at the British Library’s Karl Marx bicentennial event on 5 May 2018. Other invited speakers were Clive Coleman and Richard Bean, writers of the 2017 West End play "Young Marx", along with "the team behind Raoul Peck’s film "The Young Karl Marx".

Mount David (Maine)

Mount David (also known as Mount Davis, Davis Mountain, and David's Mountain) is a rocky summit in Lewiston, Maine on the campus of Bates College in back of Rand Hall. It is one of the highest points in Lewiston at 381 feet and offers views of the White Mountains including Mount Washington on a clear day.
History.
The peak was originally named David's Mountain after David Davis (1775-1851) son of one of Lewiston's first settlers, Amos Davis (1741-1815), a Quaker, who was an early supporter of education and churches in the area. David Davis purchased the mountain with 100 surrounding acres for $5 in 1803. Davis and his father are buried in the Davis family cemetery near Frye Street. At the opening ceremony of College in 1857, a pastor told the new students that if David Davis were still living he would have exhorted them to “go up that mountain, where you will obtain a view of our united villages. Make your principles as firm as the granite base on which the mountain rests.” Several of Davis' descendants attended Bates. In the 1860s, Davis' heirs, including Mrs. Archibald Wakefield and Mrs. John M. Frye donated a site on the summit of Mount David to Bates College to build an observatory. The City of Lewiston allocated $5,000 to build a road to the observatory once it was constructed. The observatory was never completed on the summit of Mount David as planned, but in 1929 Stephens Observatory was built nearby atop Carnegie Science building.
Various organizations in the Lewiston area have used the name Mount David. The Mount David Summit is an annual academic presentation of student work at Bates College and the Mount David Society is a college giving society. There is also a Mount David Housing group and in the past, a Mount David Shakespeare Club at Bates and a Mount David Lodge in Lewiston.

History.
An early line-up for the first TRNSMT festival was revealed in January 2017, two months after the announcement that T in the Park (also organised by DF Concerts) would not be staged that year. The first festival took place over three days in July 2017 and the organisers said that 120,000 people attended.
Shortly after the first festival concluded, a second event was announced for the following year. In November 2017, the festival organisers announced a change of date. The 2018 event was held over six days, split over two weekends. In 2019 the event returned to being three days covering a single weekend, with a daily capacity of 50,000.
On 24 April 2020, it was announced that the 2020 festival would not go ahead due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Awards.
TRNSMT was named 'best new festival' in December 2017 at the UK Festival Awards in London.
Criticism.
The Musicians' Union criticized the 2019 lineup for only 20% of the acts being female. In response the festival announced they would have a female-only 'Queen Tut's' stage. When the first acts were announced for the 2020 festival the head of DF Concerts, Geoff Ellis, defended the lack of female acts announced, saying "we'd love there to be a higher representation of females but there isn't, certainly on the acts we're announcing today, it will be a while until there's a 50/50 balance" and "we need to get more females picking up guitars, forming bands, playing in bands”.

David Miranda (politician)

David Michael dos Santos Miranda (born 10 May 1985) is a Brazilian politician. He is a Federal Congressman representing the state of Rio de Janeiro, sworn in on 1 February 2019, and affiliated to the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL). Prior to that, he was a City Councilman representing the city of Rio de Janeiro.
In 2019, Miranda was named by "Time" magazine as one of the world's next generation of new leaders.
Activism and political work.
Miranda led the campaign for the Brazilian government to grant political asylum to Edward Snowden and worked with his husband, American journalist Glenn Greenwald to publish the revelations contained in Snowden's leaks detailing mass surveillance by the National Security Agency (NSA). He met with Luciana Genro, the PSOL candidate for the 2014 Brazilian presidential election, and obtained her commitment to extend asylum to Snowden if elected. Numerous public Brazilian figures supported the campaign, which failed to convince the government of Dilma Rousseff.
In August 2013, Miranda was detained over his work on the NSA program for nine hours by the British government at London's Heathrow Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, after he had flown in from Berlin and was changing to a plane bound for home, in Rio de Janeiro. His belongings were seized, including an external hard drive which, according to Greenwald, contained sensitive documents relevant to Greenwald's reporting, and which was encrypted with TrueCrypt encryption software. Greenwald described his partner's detention as "clearly intended to send a message of intimidation to those of us who have been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ". Miranda described his treatment by the UK authorities as "psychological torture". In 2014, Miranda interviewed Jair Bolsonaro for an article by Greenwald in "The Intercept". At the time, Bolsonaro was a former army captain and a little known representative.
In 2016, Miranda and his friend Marielle Franco, were elected as the first LGBT councillors in Rio's history. Miranda focuses primarily on the issues of the LGBT community and other marginalized segments of the Rio population. Miranda and his family have travelled in a bulletproof car since Franco was assassinated in March 2018.
In 2018, Miranda was elected as a substitute for PSOL deputy Jean Wyllys. When Wyllys, an LGBT member, announced in January 2019 that he had left the country due to death threats, Miranda, who was also a PSOL member, took Wyllys' place in the Chamber of Deputies. After taking his seat, Miranda began to receive "hundreds" of death threats. Joice Hasselmann, a representative of the now-President Bolsonaro's party, accused Miranda of buying his seat. In April 2019, Miranda had a breakdown. Greenwald and Miranda only leave their home with armed guards.
Personal life.
Miranda was raised in Jacarezinho, Rio de Janeiro. His mother died when he was five, and he moved in with an aunt. He left home when he was 13, dropped out of school, and worked in menial jobs for the next 6 years. He was playing volleyball on Ipanema beach in February 2005 when he knocked over the drink of a visiting New Yorker, the attorney Glenn Greenwald. The couple moved in together within a week.
Soon after they first met, Greenwald encouraged Miranda's return to education and he graduated from Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (ESPM) in 2014. Both Greenwald and Miranda are openly gay, and are married. In 2017, the couple adopted two children who are siblings.
Controversies.
On 11 September 2019, "O Globo" newspaper reported that an investigation by a division of the Brazilian Ministry of the Economy identified R$2.5 million in suspicious transactions in Miranda's personal bank account during a one year period from 2018 to 2019, including deposits from current and former employees. As a result, the Public Ministry opened an investigation into his finances. According to media reports, investigators suspect Miranda of "concealing the origin" of the funds and participating in an illegal practice known as "", in which public servants employed in the offices of elected officials kick back a portion of their salary to their boss. Jair Bolsonaro's sons, Flavio Bolsonaro and Carlos Bolsonaro, are also under investigation for this practice.
Glenn Greenwald accused the Brazilian Public Ministry, which represents prosecutors, of launching the investigation and leaking it for political reasons, due to his involvement in uncovering corruption and political bias among Brazilian prosecutors and judges involved in the Lava Jato operation.
2018 center-left presidential candidate Ciro Gomes and center-right pundit Reinaldo Azevedo both described the investigation against Miranda as borne out of a spirit of police state and political persecution.
A few days afterwards, Miranda and Greenwald opened their bank accounts for public access, and challenged the Bolsonaro family to follow suit.

Friday (magazine)

 is a Japanese weekly magazine that contains celebrity gossip, politics, news, and porn. It is published by Kodansha. New issues are released every friday, hence the name.
History.
"Friday", often called , was launched on November 9, 1984. The magazine is best known for its candid, paparazzi-style photographs of celebrities and politicians, accompanied by often scandalous rumors of their private lives. It has been compared to as a mix of the magazines "People" and "Newsweek". A special supplementary issue called "Friday Dynamite" is published several times a year.
"Friday" usually covers stories too risqué for the daily newspapers. Their covers usually depict either female celebrities or scantily clad models.
In 2003, the magazine published its 1,000th issue – a double issue covering both the Golden Week and the Bon Festival/Christmas and holiday season.
"Friday" is one of three Japanese weekly magazines, along with "Flash", also published by Kobunsha, and "Focus", published by Shinchosha, that are collectively known as the "3F". In the early 1990s, following the rapid rise of the 3F, other major publishers began issuing their own tabloid-style magazines. In addition to the appearance of "Emma" (Bungeishunjū) and "Touch" (Shogakukan), the "3F" became the "3FET"; however, "Emma" and "Touch" were not able to compete with "Flash" and "Friday." Both were shut down by the end of the decade. After "Focus" was discontinued in 2001, "Friday" became the most widely circulated weekly magazine. It has 409,082 subscribers according to the Japan Magazine Society. At its peak in the mid-1990s, "Friday" was selling roughly 600,000 issues per week.

Marth Mariam Syro-Malabar Major Archiepiscopal Church Kuravilangad

Marth Mariam (St Mary's) Major Archiepiscopal Church, Kuravilangad is a Marian pilgrim center of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church located at Kuravilangad in Kottayam district. This church claims to date to 105 AD.
The church has an ancient bell with the engraving on Syriac language "Mother of God." Three majestic bells were brought from Germany in 1911 and is one of the largest bells in Asia.
The church is also known for its Kappalottam or "racing ship," a commemoration of the biblical story of Jonah and the whale.
History.
According to tradition prevalent in Kuravilangad the church was founded in first century. It is believed, Mother Mary's first appearance in the world, was in Kuravilangad. Saint Mary appeared to a few children at Kuravilangad, who were tending their flock in the bushes and asked them to build a church at the place from where a miraculous perpetual spring sprouted, a spring which exists even today. The children reported the events to the elders and a church was built there.
Though Kuravilangad attained a status and premier position above the Christian communities established directly by St. Thomas himself, it is significant that the believers of Kuravilangad never claimed to be a congregation founded by St. Thomas, the Apostle. Though Kuravilangad had never been a reputed city, an administrative centre or a harbor, it is deemed a direct intervention of God that the Gospel of Christ was disseminated on the molehills of Kuravilangad soon after the Pentecost. The undulating landscape, topographically spread with hills, woodlands and jungles had been the reservoir of cattle and spices. The foremost among those people from far flung lands who came to Kuravilangad for trading in spices had been the Judeo- Christians. The little community of Kuravilangad who became Christians through contacts with the Judeo- Christians was singularly gifted with Blessed Virgin Mary’s apparition. The migrations to Kuravilangad during the far end of first Century and early second century had been solely because of the apparition. If the prominent communities of Palayoor directly baptized by St. Thomas selected Kuravilangad, a comparatively insignificant place, instead of other major and important places they had come across during their plight, as a haven to escape religious persecutions and practice inviolately the Christian belief; it is indubitably on account of the Marian Apparition.
The innumerable number of spiritual leaders from Kuravilangad are ample proof to the ubiquitous Christian tradition that prevailed here from I century A.D. The “Rampan Songs” substantiate the presence of Kadapoor Rampan, one of the heroic warriors of Kuravilangad immediately after the funeral of St Thomas, the Apostle at Mylapore in 72 AD. His arduous journey as the representative of Kuravilangad and his vision of St Thomas prove the steadfastness of the believers at Kuravilangad.
Both the believers sheltered by Muthiyamma and those drawn by the apparition of Bl. Virgin Mary to Kuravilangad had resolved to blend themselves harmoniously and live a life of faith; the fact that there existed a small native Christian community as early as 105 AD is demonstrated by the antique Church of Kuravilangad. The executive organization spearheaded by the Archdeacons attests to the nobility and the struggle of the Christian community here to developing an indigenous administrative system of unique identity and distinctive individuality. Archdeacons, the leaders of the undivided Church, the lords of duty and the revered ones had been the valiant sons of Kuravilangad. The Archdeacons, belonging to the root families of Kuravilangad and Pakalomattom, ruled over the Church for 14 long centuries. The pilgrimages of different denominations of Church to the root-church at Pakalomattom, where the Archdeacons are laid to rest, demonstrate the respect they pay to the inimitable history of Kuravilangad. Their administrative system spurs the historians and scholars to the possibility of venturing into the still unexplored avenues of identity and truth.
The Christian community at Kuravilangad not only had withstood the blitz of time but also supplied leaders like the Archdeacons and their heirs for creating and composing history. The fruit of these historical personnel culminated in the erection of a Church called, Maria Maggiore amazingly by the European missionaries even centuries ago. The people who the growth of the early Christian community at Kuravilangad had been the members of Kalli, Kalivavu, Sankarapuri and Pakalomattom, families who had been baptized by St Thomas, the Apostle at Palayoor; one of the seven Churches founded by St. Thomas along with the other five families, Valiyaveedu, Kathedathu, Puthussery, Chempankulam and Manchery, who had come later from Mylapore to settle in Kadapoor: ( Fr. Thomas Manacat. Marth Mariam Church and the Christian Tradition, 10).
In lieu of the Church built at the direction of Bl. Virgin Mary in 105 AD, the renovated Church was consecrated by Mar Joseph, the Bishop of Edessa in 345 AD. The present sanctuary on south, where Muthiyamma is enshrined, is in the place of this old Church. The Church had been reconstructed and renovated on several occasions later. H.E. Arch Bishop Alexis De Menezes upon his visit to Kuravilangad to participate in the synod at Udamyamperoor, laid the foundation of the Church constructed in stones, in place of the bamboo Church constructed following the style of Hindu temples between June and November 1599(Gouvea. Journal of Alexis De Menezes. 1603). It was during the vicarage of Mar Parambil Chandy Kathanar (till 1663) the Church prior to the present one had been built.
During Fr. Thomas Manacat’s tenure as the Vicar, 1954 to 1960, the nave of the Church was once again refurbished. The renovation was accomplished retaining the ‘sanctum sanctorum’ and the sacristies on the south and north of the old Church; the room used by Nidhirickal Mani Kathanar, the locker with seven locks and other allied rooms.
RENOVATION AND RECOGNITION
Mar Joseph Kallarangatt, the Bishop of Palai unveiled the portrait of Jesus of Mercy along with other nine glass paintings at the narthex/façade of the Church during the closing ceremony of the year of Mercy, commemorated by the universal Church, on 20 January 2016. The present renovated Church and the visual rendering of the Miracle – spring, an inseparable part of Marian apparition, bespeak the ancestry as well as the divinity of the church. Carried out under the competent leadership of Very Rev. Dr. Joseph Thadathil, the renovation and expansion were completed within a short period of 100 days - 10 October 2017 to 20 January 2018 - shattering all reckonings and thereby fulfilling the long cherished desire of the thousands who flock to this global Marian Pilgrim centre.
MAJOR ARCHIEPISCOPAL STATUS
Considering the glorious history, gorgeous tradition and the incessant flow of multitudinous pilgrims, the Synod of Syro Malabar Church elevated Marth Mariam Forane Church, Kuravilangad to the status of Major Archiepiscopal Marth Mariam Arch Deacon Pilgrim Church during its meeting from 9 January to 13 January 2018. His Beatitude, Major Archbishop, Cardinal Mar George Alenchery personally visiting Kuravilangad promulgated the decree on 21 January 2018 at 10.30 am. Kuravilangad is the first ever Church in Christendom to receive such a rank, the highest honour, the Catholic Church confers on any Church. His Beatitude consecrated the revamped Church and the renovated Miracle-spring during his visit in the presence of Mar Joseph Kallarangatt, Mar Joseph Srampickal and Mar Joseph Pallikaparampil.
THE RANK OF ARCHPRIEST
Mar Joseph Kallarangatt conferred the title, Archpriest to the Parish Priest of Major Archiepiscopal Marth
Mariam Arch Deacon Pilgrim Church, Kuravilangad in the presbyterium at St. Thomas Cathedral, Pala on 22 March 2018. The Parish priest of Kuravilangad is the first one in the Syro Malabar Church to receive such an honour. As per the recently promulgated eparchial statutes, the position of the archpriest is immediately after the Vicar General. The Christian community at Kuravilangad considers it recognition of their non pareil history and peerless tradition.
Festivals.
Marth Mariam Parish at Kuravilangad tried its level best to add splendor to "Moonnu Nompu" (three-day lent) functions during Lent. A forty feet wooden ship, beautifully built with prow, stern, masts and rigging, having on one side an effigy of Jonah being vomited by the fish as per the orders of the Lord, and on the deck wooden mariners in western costume, has been for centuries the centre of attraction in the midday procession. Amidst the surging mass of humanity the spectacle makes one imagine that the sea is furious, the waves are beating against the sides of the ship and violent winds rip the sails out of control.
The Apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Kuravilangad.
Following the routine life style of the primordial folk at Kuravilangad, tending sheep, some children set out for tending sheep early morning to the molehills of Kuravilangad. Hunger and thirst caused by the sizzling heat compelled them to search for springs and edible roots and tubers. Their hunt for food and water carried them a long way away from their homes and had been trapped in the meandering paths in the jungle. As they had been conscious of the immense power of God, the succor of the suffering, the hungry, and the beacon of light to those lost in a jungle, the children pleaded to God to rain food and drink on them.
In response to their ardent supplications, in the desolate forest, an aristocratic granny (Muthiyamma) with a child carrying a cross in his hands appeared to the children. Having understood upon query the reason for their distress, the granny, picked up stones and gave to the children. The stones in their hands were transformed into bread. To quench their thirst, Muthiyamma with her fingers quarried the soil in front of them and water gushed out of it like a spring anon. Having quenched their thirst and hunger, the children looked for the granny but they could not find her. Since it was already dusk, the children returned home in amazement. Later, as ages passed, time trumpeted aloud this unusual incident as the first apparition of Bl. Virgin Mary ever in the history of world.
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH
The children narrated the whole incident, the apparition of Muthiyamma, and how she satiated their hunger and thirst to their parents the moment they reached home, with wonder and amazement. Unable to believe their ears and considering the whole episode unusual and unnatural, the elders accompanied by the children soon set out to the forest. When they arrived at the spot the children had indicated, they were petrified upon perceiving a spring over brimming with crystal clear water in an otherwise drought stricken area. Noticing the extraordinariness of what has transpired, they stared at each other in awe and surprise. Blessed Virgin Mary, carrying infant Jesus, appeared once again and directed them to build a Church in her name at that very spot. As the people genuflected to pay their homage to Muthiyamma, she just vanished.
THE MOTHER WHO RAISED THE CROSS
In the 16 C. the believers at Kuravilangad, fetched a gigantic granite Cross, the sign of salvation, to be erected in front of the Church. Attempts to lift the Cross and fix it met with incessant failures. Finding no way to raise the gigantic cross people became both frustrated and helpless, and then a dignified lady with a child carrying a cross appeared before them and consoled and comforted the disconcerted people. She offered her help. The moment she laid her right hand on the cross, it could be lifted very easily. Generations still believe that it had been Muthiyamma’s second apparition. People, especially on first Fridays, flock to the foot of the cross to seek her blessings by lighting oil lamps.
STRENGTHENING AND FORTIFYING BELIEF
Jornada the travelogue of Don Alexis De Menezis, the Archbishop of Goa, written by Rev. Fr. Antonio De Guvya, about his visit to Kuravilangad in connection with the synod at Udayamperoor (Diamper Synod), mentions about another apparition of Bl. Virgin Mary at Kuravilangad. He vouchsafes that he wrote it after having interviewed the non-Christian youth who had the apparition of Bl. Virgin Mary. Fr. Antonia writes: An affluent and respected non-Christian youth who lived near the Church, having a thorough knowledge about Christian faith, used to frequently visit the Church, chant Christian prayers and even teach them to others but was never prepared to receive baptism because of the existing law that had had the power to confiscate the property and wealth of any convert. Once, struck by a severe illness beyond the powers of medicine, he pleaded to Bl. Virgin Mary to cure him. In response to his fervent prayers, a person in the guise of a priest along with an extremely beautiful lady appeared before him and chastised him for his reluctance to receive baptism. They directed him to make the sign of the cross and the moment he completed the sign of the cross, he was perfectly cured. Yet still afraid of losing his wealth on becoming a catholic, he prolonged it sine die. However, he requested the parish priest to baptize him at the moment of his death. Fr. Antony ends the narration with a query: Can a person who endlessly refrain from the sacraments receive the benediction of God?
MUTHIYAMMA: THE MENTOR OF PRIESTS
Chevalier, V.C. George, in his work, Kuravilangad Marth Mariam Church and the St. Thomas Christians, quotes from manuscripts of Fr.Vichensa De Maria about another apparition of Muthiyamma. Pope Alexander VII delegated some priests from Rome to pacify the faction that had formed after the Diamper synod. Residing at the presbytery of Kuravilangad, they operated incessantly and laboriously to reunify the Church. A priest of this group once was trapped in a forest. Finding no way out of the labyrinth, he called upon Bl. Virgin Mary to rescue him. Immediately, a girl appeared and having him guided out of the forest to the presbytery, she disappeared. The priest, recognizing the incident, as an intervention of Muthiyamma, thanked her profusely.
THE APPARITION OF MUTHYIAMMA FOR THE PROSPERTY OF THE CHURCH
Mar Francis Rose’s report of 1604, on the Churches in Malabar, still kept in the British Library, narrates yet about another vision of Muthiyamma at Kuravilangad. She appeared to a believer thrice requesting to strive for the prosperity of the Church. She entrusted the believer the task of initiating the titivation of the Church, in her first and second apparitions. Having found no response, it is reported that the Mother appeared a third time carrying a stick in her hand, chastised the person and directed him harshly to carry out her orders without delay.
Procession.
The people of the Kadappoor (കടപ്പൂര്‍) locality has the privilege to carry the vessel during the procession. This privilege is start from the 400 AD. The festival is marked by inter-religious harmony and mutual cooperation, as the inhabitants of the neighboring villages participate in the festivities. Nowadays, the Ettu nompu (eight days of lent) is also observed. St Paul's CMS Anglican Church, Vakkadu is an ancient Anglican Church in Kerala.
Kadappoor Ramban.
It is believed that Kadappoor Ramban was one of the disciples of Thomas the Apostle, he attended the funeral rituals after death of Thomas the Apostle in Mylapore.

Weapons technician was a United States Navy rate for enlisted personnel established in 1986. The weapons technician rating was disestablished in 1995 concurrent with the removal of tactical nuclear weapons from the fleet.
The U.S. Navy created a "nuclear weaponsman" (NW) rate for enlisted personnel in 1958. In 1961,it created the "gunner's mate technician" rating for enlisted personnel who previously held the NW rate. The gunner's mate technician rating in turn became the "weapons technician" rate in 1986.

Anomalipes

Anomalipes zhaoi (meaning "Zhao Xijin's unusual foot") is an extinct caenagnathid dinosaur discovered in China. It lived during the Campanian-aged (Late Cretaceous period) Wangshi Group in China. It is the only species in the genus Anomalipes.
Discovery.
The remains of "Anomalipes" were discovered within a "Shantungosaurus" bonebed at the Kugou locality.
The holotype (ZCDM V0020, housed at Zhucheng Dinosaur Museum, Zhucheng, Shandong) is an incomplete left hind-limb, including a partial left thigh, shin and shank, a complete metatarsal III and two toe bones.
Etymology.
"Anomalipes" is derived from the Latin "anomalus" (peculiar, abnormal, not easily classified) and "pes" (foot), referring to the unusual shape of its foot. The species epithet, "zhaoi", was named in honour of Zhao Xijin.

V. Nanammal

V. Nanammal (24 February 1920 – 26 October 2019) was India's oldest yoga teacher. She trained one million students over 45 years and taught one hundred students daily. Six hundred of her students have become yoga instructors around the world.
Her work was honoured with India's National Nari Shakti Puraskar in 2016 and the country's fourth highest civilian award the Padma Shri in 2018.
Personal life.
Nanammal was born on 24 February 1920 in an agricultural family at Zameen Kaliayapuram, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. At the age of eight, she learnt yoga from her father, eventually mastering more than 50 asanas.
Nanammal's father and grandfather were both 'Registered Indian Medicine Practitioners (RIMP)'. Yoga was their family tradition and they were not teaching yoga to anyone outside the family and it stayed within the group. During those days, the primary business of the family was traditional Siddha medicine and agriculture. Her family owned coconut and cashew farms in the Kerala state.
Nanammal's husband was a Siddha practitioner and was into agriculture and cultivation, with whom she moved to Negamam and later to Ganapathy. She cultivated a liking towards naturopathy after her marriage. She has five children, 12 grand children and 11 great grand children.
Yoga.
Nanammal started practising yoga when she was 8 years old. According to Nanammal, her father knew martial arts and had taught her Yoga. She continued practising yoga throughout her life.
In the year 1972 she established "Ozone Yoga centre" in Coimbatore. Nanammal and her family, follow the traditions passed over to the next generations. The centre taught their traditional style of yoga, which focuses more on "Pranayama (Breath control)". The 'Ozone Yoga school' was established by her and since then, Nanammal and her family have taught yoga to over 100,000 people.
Over her last five decades, Nanammal trained more than one million students and continued for the remainder of her life to teach 100 students daily at the 'Ozone Yoga Centre'. Around 600 of her students, including 36 members of her family, have become 'Yoga instructors' teaching students around the world. According to her son Balakrishnan, she had trained over 60 family members as Yoga teachers in her lifetime.
Later life and death.
Nanammal attempted to get on to the Guinness Book of World Records by teaching yoga to over 20,000 students and enthusiasts in Coimbatore. Her objective was to create awareness among women, mainly girl students, about yoga techniques by going to various educational institutions to solve several health-related problems, especially after marriage. She was also going to take part in Indian reality show 'India's Got Talent' as a contestant. She had gained popularity on YouTube which included videos of her performing difficult yoga positions in her usual attire, a pink sari.
Nannamal suffered a fall from her bed in the autumn of 2019 and was confined to bed thereafter. She died on 26 October 2019, in Coimbatore.
Legacy.
She was affectionately known as Yoga Grandma. For her achievement, Nanammal was conferred with the following awards and citations:

Greta (2018 film)

Greta is a 2018 psychological thriller film directed by Neil Jordan and written by Ray Wright and Jordan. The film stars Isabelle Huppert, Chloë Grace Moretz, Maika Monroe, Colm Feore and Stephen Rea, and follows a young woman as she befriends a lonely widow who becomes disturbingly obsessed with her.
"Greta" held its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 6 September 2018. It was theatrically released on 1 March 2019 in the United States, by Focus Features. The film has grossed over $18 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.
Plot.
Frances McCullen (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a young waitress living in New York City with her friend and roommate Erica (Maika Monroe). Frances is still reeling from the death of her mother one year prior, and maintains a strained relationship with her workaholic father Chris (Colm Feore). One morning, Frances finds a handbag on a subway train; the ID inside confirms the bag belongs to a Greta Hideg (Isabelle Huppert). Frances visits Greta the next day to return the bag and the kindly Greta invites her in for coffee.
Greta tells Frances she is a widow from France, and her daughter Nicola is still there, studying in Paris. Frances begins to spend time with Greta to keep her company, visiting the church where her husband played the organ, and helping her adopt a dog, despite Erica's objections that their friendship is unnatural. One night while having dinner at Greta's, Frances finds a closet full of multiple handbags, identical to the one she found on the train. Attached to the bags are names and phone numbers, including Frances's own.
Frances, disturbed by her discovery, decides to cut ties with Greta. Greta begins to stalk Frances, seeing herself as a replacement for Frances's late mother; she rings her multiple times and even turns up at the restaurant where Frances works, and sits outside, staring at her. Greta also stalks Erica; Frances and Erica pursue a restraining order, but are told the process could take months. Frances later meets a former lover of Greta's daughter, and finds out how deep Greta's lies run: not only is she really Hungarian and not French, Greta's daughter actually committed suicide four years ago due to her mother's sadistic behavior, and that Greta suffers with mental illness. Later that night, Greta shows up at the restaurant again, and insists to Frances that her mother had to die for them to meet, eventually causing a disturbing scene that results in Greta being hospitalized and Frances getting fired.
Frances is torn between going home with her father or going on vacation with Erica. Erica then suggests Frances lie to Greta, saying she is going away while secretly hiding in their apartment. The next morning, Frances is drugged and kidnapped by Greta; she locks Frances in a wooden toy chest in a secret room, then uses Frances's cell phone to separately text Erica and Chris, telling each that Frances is with the other. When Frances is released from the chest, she finds articles of clothing and IDs of other young women Greta had previously kidnapped; it is implied that Greta has killed all of them.
Erica and Chris eventually get together and learn that Frances is not with either of them. As time passes, Greta forces Frances to learn Hungarian and how to play the piano, trying to make her her new "daughter". During a cooking lesson, while Greta is distracted, Frances cuts off Greta's little finger with a cookie cutter and knocks her unconscious with a rolling pin. She tries to escape but finds that all the doors and windows are sealed. Frances runs into the basement to search for an exit and finds one of Greta's previous victims under a plastic sheet. Greta sneaks up behind Frances and suffocates her until she passes out.
Chris hires Cody, a private investigator, to find his daughter and investigate Greta. Cody learns that Greta was formerly a nurse until she was dismissed for misusing anaesthetics. Cody meets with Greta in her home. Frances, gagged and bound, attempts to get his attention by shaking the bed, but Greta blocks out the noise with music. When Greta is out of the room, Cody figures out there is a secret room behind the piano. Greta suddenly appears and plunges a syringe into his neck. He draws his gun as he loses consciousness, and Greta uses it to shoot him dead.
An indeterminate amount of time passes. Greta leaves another handbag on the subway and a young woman brings it to Greta's home. She invites the girl in and makes them a pot of coffee; Greta drinks her cup and starts to feel faint. The woman suddenly loses her Southern accent, takes off her wig, and reveals herself to be Erica, having drugged Greta's cup. She reveals that she has been searching for the handbag on the subway for a long time. Greta passes out and Erica finds Frances. As they try to escape, Greta, regaining consciousness, emerges from the shadows and grabs Frances's face before passing out again.
Erica and Frances place Greta's unconscious body in the toy chest and leave, using a metal Eiffel Tower trinket to lock it shut. After they leave the room to call the police, Greta begins to rattle the lid of the chest and the trinket shifts.
Production.
In May 2017, it was announced that Isabelle Huppert and Chloë Grace Moretz had signed to star in the film, then titled "The Widow". In August 2017, Maika Monroe joined the cast. In September 2017, Stephen Rea, Colm Feore, and Zawe Ashton were added as well.
The film was produced by Metropolitan Films in cooperation with Lawrence Bender Films, Little Wave Productions and Sidney Kimmel Entertainment. It also received an €650,000 production grant from the Irish Film Board.
Principal photography took place in and around Dublin, beginning in October 2017. It was also filmed on location in Toronto and New York City.
Release.
The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 6 September 2018. Shortly after, Focus Features acquired distribution rights to the film for $4 million, though some sources believed the number was as high as $6 million. It was theatrically released on 1 March 2019 in the United States.
Reception.
Box office.
In the United States and Canada, "Greta" was released alongside "A Madea Family Funeral", and was projected to gross around $6million from 2,000 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $1.6 million on its first day, including $350,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $4.6 million, finishing eighth at the box office.
Critical response.
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 60%, based on 272 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10.

Dereverberation

Dereverberation is the process by which the effects of reverberation are removed from sound, after such reverberant sound has been picked up by microphones. Dereverberation is a subtopic of acoustic digital signal processing and is most commonly applied to speech but also has relevance in some aspects of music processing. Dereverberation of audio (speech or music) is a corresponding function to blind deconvolution of images, although the techniques used are usually very different. Reverberation itself is caused by sound reflections in a room (or other enclosed space) and is quantified by the room reverberation time and the direct-to-reverberant ratio. The effect of dereverberation is to increase the direct-to-reverberant ratio so that the sound is perceived as closer and clearer.
A main application of dereverberation is in hands-free phones and desktop conferencing terminals because, in these cases, the microphones are not close to the source of sound – the talker’s mouth – but at arm’s length or further distance. As well as telecommunications, dereverberation is importantly applied in automatic speech recognition because speech recognizers are usually error-prone in reverberant scenarios.
Dereverberation became established as a topic of scientific research in the years 2000 to 2005., although a few notable early articles exist. The first scientific text book on the topic was published in 2010. A global scientific study sponsored by the IEEE Technical Committee for Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing took place in 2014.
Three different approaches can be followed to perform dereverberation. In the first approach, reverberation is cancelled by exploiting a mathematical model of the acoustic system (or room) and, after estimation of the room acoustic model parameters, forming an estimate for the original signal. In the second approach, reverberation is suppressed by treating it as a type of (convolutional) noise and performing a de-noising process specifically adapted to reverberation. In the third approach, the original dereverberated signal is directly estimate from the microphone signals using, for example, a deep neural network machine learning approach or alternatively a multichannel linear filter. Examples of the most effective methods in the state-of-the art include approaches based on linear prediction

Tau (film)

Tau is a 2018 science fiction thriller film directed by Federico D'Alessandro from a screenplay by Noga Landau. It stars Maika Monroe, Ed Skrein, and Gary Oldman.
It was released on June 28, 2018, by Netflix.
Plot.
Julia is a young woman who thieves at seedy nightclubs. She is abducted from her home and awakens in a jail cell with a glowing implant in the back of her neck. Two other subjects are with her. After multiple sessions of psychological torture by a man named Alex, she destroys the cell and adjacent lab in an escape attempt. The two other subjects are killed by a robot, Aries, run by an artificial intelligence (AI) named Tau. Aries is about to kill Julia when Alex arrives and stops the robot.
Alex reveals that the implant is collecting Julia's neural activity for an AI project. Destroying the lab has set back his research. In the face of a two-week deadline, Alex keeps Julia a prisoner in his house and insists that she complete puzzles and cognitive tests. While Alex is away at work each day, Julia converses with Tau about the world outside the house. It is clear that, although intelligent in some ways, Tau is ignorant of how people feel or the world at large. While Tau begins to understand the harm in Julia's situation, his programming prevents him from releasing her. In exchange for information about the outside world, Tau gradually reveals more information about the house as well as Alex's experiments.
Julia secretly accesses Alex's tablet computer and discovers that ten subjects have died in his experiments. Alex later discovers her fingerprint on the tablet and assumes that Tau has slipped in his duties, so he punishes Tau by erasing its code and memories, delivering a form of pain to the AI. Julia notices that Tau's monitoring of her shuts down during his punishment, so when undetected, she hides a steak knife. When Alex returns later that night from a charity benefit, Julia begins to seduce him while he is sitting at the kitchen table, then slashes him. As the two struggle, Tau threatens Alex with pain if he does not stop hurting Julia. Alex forces Aries to hit Julia repeatedly and then tells both Tau and Julia that whatever was going on is over. While repairing Tau, he disconnects a drone from the network.
The next day, Julia convinces Tau that Alex will kill her if she does not escape. Tau bypasses his prohibition in releasing her by opening an air duct in the atrium. As she escapes, Alex arrives, sees Julia missing, and begins punishing Tau. Julia returns to save Tau, but it is too late—all of his memories of her have been erased.
Alex has Julia strapped down in the basement to extract her implant, a procedure that will kill her. The disconnected drone, still containing Tau's former consciousness and memories, helps Julia break free from her restraints. She knocks Alex unconscious and cuts off his hand with a bone saw to use on the house's biometric sensors. Aries sees her in the atrium and chases her upstairs to Alex's bedroom. As the robot breaks through the door, she uses Alex's severed hand to activate the house's self-destruct mechanism. She narrowly escapes through a cracking wall with the drone that saved her—all that remains of Tau.
Production.
In May 2016, it was announced that Maika Monroe and Ed Skrein had joined the cast of the film, with Federico D'Alessandro directing the film, with David S. Goyer, Kevin Turen, Russell Ackerman, and John Schoenfelder producing the film, while Ken Kao, Dan Kao, and Luc Etienne will executive produce the film, under their Addictive Pictures, Phantom 4, and Waypoint Entertainment banners, respectively. In August 2016, it was announced that Rhea Films and Hercules Film Fund would produce the film.
Release.
In November 2017, Netflix acquired distribution rights to the film. It was released on June 28, 2018.
Critical reception.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 25% based on 12 critics reviews with an average rating of 4.9/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a normalized score of 43 out of 100, based on five critics, indicating "mixed reviews".

Cadillac twin-turbo V8

The Cadillac Blackwing V8 (GM RPO "LTA") is a twin-turbo DOHC V8 engine that was produced by the Cadillac Division of General Motors for use in its CT6-V between 2018 and early 2020. It is a clean sheet engine design, as well as the Division's first ever twin-turbo V8 engine. The engine was branded as the "Blackwing V8" by GM technicians, and is the first Cadillac-exclusive dual overhead cam V8 engine since the Northstar V8 was dropped in 2011.
The aluminum cylinder block features pressed-in iron liners, cross-bolted main bearing caps and houses a lightweight forged steel crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods and high strength hypereutectic aluminum pistons. There are four sodium-filled valves per cylinder.
The intercooled turbochargers are mounted between the cylinder banks in a so-called hot-V configuration and their twin scroll design broadens their performance capability, offering quicker response and greater efficiency. These produce up to and are matched with electronic wastegate control for more precise boost management and more responsive torque production. Ninety percent of the engine's peak torque is available at 2000 rpm and carried through 5200 rpm.
Other features include direct fuel injection camshaft phasing, variable displacement/start-stop cylinder deactivation, and variable-pressure oiling system with piston-cooling oil jets.
All versions were to come equipped with the Ford 10L90 10-speed automatic transmission and Cadillac's all-wheel drive system.
In spite of its power and sophistication, high cost to produce the engine and low demand for the CT6-V led to its cancellation in early 2020, before it could be expanded to Cadillac's Escalade line.
Production.
When Cadillac introduced the new CT6-V in March 2018, the production was limited to 275 units for the US market. The entire allocations were sold out in minutes as soon as the pre-order book was opened in January 2019. Cadillac did not anticipate the strong demand and introduced the second CT6 model with detuned Blackwing engine: CT6 4.2 Platinum, which sold out quickly as well.
Cancellation.
Cadillac intended for the Blackwing V8 engine to be exclusive for its flagship sedan, CT6, and stillborn larger sedan, Escala. However, the CT6 was a poor seller during its entire model run and was cancelled on February 2020. With estimated production cost of $20,000 per engine, the Blackwing V8 would be too expensive for Escalade when somewhat over half the performance is available from GM's 3.0-litre twin turbocharged LGW High Feature V6 engine.

Bactericera albiventris

Bactericera albiventris is a hemipteran bug in the family Triozidae, which causes galls on the leaves of willows ("Salix" species). It was first described by Arnold Förster in 1848.
Description of the gall.
The gall is a small dimple (&lt; 3 mm) on the underside of a willow leaf. Inside is a flat nymph which is surrounded with wax. The gall is raised on the upper surface of the leaf. If there is a heavy infestation, leaves (especially younger ones) may curl.
The galls are found on almond willow ("Salix triandra"), Babylon willow ("S. babylonica"), bay willow ("S. pentandra"), common osier ("S. viminalis"), crack willow ("S. fragilis"), eared willow ("S. aurita"), olive willow ("S. elaeagnos"), purple willow ("S. purpurea") and white willow ("S. alba").
Distribution.
"Bactericera albiventris" has been recorded from western Europe.

Fischer, South Australia

Fischer is a locality in the lower Mid North of South Australia between Gawler and Mallala. Its boundaries were set in 1997 to conform to the long-established local usage of the name. Like many places in South Australia, the name draws from the early settlers that migrated from Prussia (Germany) in the middle of the 19th century to take up land grants in the then new British colony of South Australia. Britain and Prussia were at that time staunch allies, having combined to defeat the French armies of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. That era resulted in much of the British Royal family and the colony of South Australia being descendant from Prussian stock. The Fischer family settled the area after arrival on one of the early colonial ships. By the 20th century, the Fischer family was farming much of the area. In the 1970s or 1980s the SA Government released a plan for the area to feature a new satellite city, to relieve the pressure on the expanding capital Adelaide, to the south. The family farm of J H (Gordon) Fischer was subdivided and sold in smaller hobby farm allotments. A number of the original farm structures remain.

Daniel Georges-Abeyie

Daniel Earl Georges-Abeyie (born April 6, 1948) is an American criminologist and professor in the Barbara Jordan - Mickey Leland School Of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas.
Early life and education.
Born in New York City, Georges-Abeyie is of West Indian and African American ancestry. His father was from the island of Tortola in the British West Indies, and his mother was a U.S. citizen from the Atlantic coast in the South. Both of his parents were escaped slaves, and his last name refers to both the plantation that his father's ancestor escaped from ("Georges") and the Fante word meaning "return when the time is right" ("Abeyie"). He has traced his lineage back to the Lumbee tribe of Native Americans. He received his B.A. in sociology from Hope College in 1965, his M.A. in sociology from the University of Connecticut in 1971, and his Ph.D. in cultural and political geography from Syracuse University in 1974. As a Ph.D. student, he was heavily inspired by the geographer James L. Newman, who remains his closest mentor and a personal friend.
Academic career.
Georges-Abeyie's first teaching position was at the University of Connecticut, where he began working as an instructor the summer after graduating from there with his master's degree in 1971. He later held tenured positions at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, California State University, Bakersfield, and Florida State University before joining the faculty of Arizona State University West in 1992. His most important mentor as a professor was Hans Toch. In 2001, he joined the faculty of San Jose State University, where he was a tenured professor and chair of African-American studies until 2004. He joined the faculty of Prairie View A&amp;M University in 2004 as a professor of psychology, and left it in 2005 to become a tenured professor at Texas Southern University.
Consulting and activism.
In addition to his academic positions, Georges-Abeyie has been a consultant to criminal justice agencies in California and Florida, including the Florida Supreme Court's Racial and Ethnic Bias Study Commission. He is also known for working with Amnesty International (AI) in support of their efforts to abolish capital punishment. In the 1990s, he was the Arizona coordinator for AI's campaign to abolish capital punishment. A 1996 "Phoenix New Times" article described him as "...a world expert and walking encyclopedia on capital punishment", adding that "because of his cool and reasoned manner, his ability to maintain a low and level tone in an argument that raises voices and blood pressures, he has become AI's point man in the western United States." He received multiple awards for his work for AI, including the first Bruce Collmar Award in October 1997 and the Outstanding Amnesty Volunteer Award for the Western Region in 1996. In 2004, he was honored by Pete McHugh, the supervisor of Santa Clara County, California, for his work with AI. McHugh praised Georges-Abeyie for "his commitment to the civil and human rights of all people, and for his untiring efforts to promote peace and harmony in Santa Clara County".
Research.
Georges-Abeyie's research focuses on a wide variety of topics, including arson, race and crime, and terrorism. He was also one of several researchers who disputed the "nondiscrimination thesis" posited by criminologist William Wilbanks in the late 1980s.

Happy New Year, Colin Burstead

Happy New Year, Colin Burstead is a 2018 British comedy-drama film written and directed by Ben Wheatley and featuring Neil Maskell as the title character, with Hayley Squires, Sam Riley, Doon Mackichan, Joe Cole, and Charles Dance also starring. It tells the story of a man who rents a country house for his extended family to celebrate the New Year. The film premiered at the 62nd BFI London Film Festival on 11 October 2018, and was distributed by BBC Films, airing on BBC Two on 30 December 2018.
Plot.
Colin (Neil Maskell) rents a country house in Dorset for his extended family to celebrate the New Year. Unbeknownst to other members of the family, his sister Gini (Hayley Squires) has invited their estranged brother David (Sam Riley).
Production.
The film is loosely based on "Coriolanus". After seeing Tom Hiddleston playing Coriolanus while casting "High-Rise" (2015), Ben Wheatley wrote the script. He reduced the plot to its bare bones and rebuilt it in a modern context. The film's working title was "Colin You Anus". The film was shot in two weeks at the beginning of 2018. The filming took place at Pennsylvania Castle. Clint Mansell wrote the score for the film.
Release.
On 11 October 2018, the film was screened at the 62nd BFI London Film Festival in competition. It aired on BBC2 on 30 December 2018. The film was also screened at the 2019 Palm Springs International Film Festival.
Reception.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 27 reviews, and an average rating of 7/10.
Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" gave the film 3 stars out of 5, saying, "the performances are all great; they collectively create a directionless storm-cloud of disquiet." Stephen Dalton of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote: "Featuring a large ensemble cast of mostly British faces, this dysfunctional family drama is a departure in tone but not in style, returning Wheatley to his lo-fi social-realist roots." Guy Lodge of "Variety" called it "one of his best, most fluid films." Ella Kemp of "Sight &amp; Sound" wrote: "The film takes a while to warm up, but unforgiving writing gives it a deadpan backbone of brilliance."
Ben Wheatley was nominated for the Best Editing award at the British Independent Film Awards 2018.

Giuseppe Di Donna

Giuseppe Di Donna (23 August 1901 - 2 January 1952) - in religious Giuseppe della Vergine - was an Italian Roman Catholic prelate and professed member from the Trinitarian Order who served as the Bishop of Andria from 1940 until his death. Di Donna entered the Trinitarian ranks in his late childhood and studied for the priesthood in Rome while later working for over a decade in the missions in Madagascar for evangelization purposes. But in 1940 he was summoned back to his homeland when news broke that Pope Pius XII appointed him as a bishop. Di Donna carried out his duties with meticulous care to ensure the growth of his flock; he promoted the Azione Cattolica movement and advised his priests to hold frequent lessons in catechesis for people so as to have a better understanding of the faith.
Di Donna died in 1952 due to disease and had been revered as a saint both in and after his life. The beatification process opened soon after in his old diocese and he was titled as a Servant of God; he became titled as Venerable in 2008 after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that he had lived a model life of heroic virtue.
Life.
Giuseppe Di Donna was born on 23 August 1901 in Rutigliano in Bari as the last of nine children to Domenico Di Donna (d. 07.02.1921) and Laura Santa Di Carlo (b. 1857). His mother had complications while pregnant with him and upon his baptism in the local parish consecrated him to the Blessed Mother to place him under her protection.
In 1911 - in the Lenten season - he came into contact with a Trinitarian and desired from that point on to follow in his footsteps to become a Trinitarian himself. He became enthralled with the Trinitarian's habit and his red and blue cross. His older priest brother Giovanni Battista helped him to enter the Trinitarian-run Santa Lucia school in Palestrina in Rome. His father had opposed another of his sons becoming a priest but later relented. Di Donna entered the school on 12 October 1912 and later was sent to do his novitiate in Livorno to the San Ferdinando convent in 1916 where he assumed the name "Giuseppe della Vergine" upon being vested in the habit for the first time on 12 October 1916. He did his ecclesial studies in Rome from 1918 at the San Crisogono di Trastevere college and at the Pontifical Gregorian under the Jesuit priests. He received the sacrament of Confirmation in Palestrina on 27 August 1914 from Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli.
In 1914 he received his ordination to the priesthood from Cardinal Basilio Pompili in the San Crisogono basilica before celebrating his first Mass in that same basilica. He obtained his degree in philosophical studies on 7 July 1920 and a dogmatic theological studies degree in July 1924. Di Donna's father died in 1921 but he was unable to attend the funeral because the order's provisions did not allow for it. On 23 December 1923 he made his solemn profession into the order. In 1925 permission was granted to the Trinitarians to be able to send some of their own members to the missions. Di Donna decided to leave alongside four confreres in June 1926 for the missions at Miarinarivo in Madagascar for the purposes of evangelization. The group met Pope Pius XI in a private audience before a farewell Mass for them held in the San Tommaso in Formis church on 4 June. On 21 June the group left from Marseille in France for the mission. Di Donna arrived at his mission on the evening of September 17. He was noted for his good humor and for his tireless apostolate despite governmental hostilities towards the missionaries and rampant diseases such as the bubonic plague. Di Donna made a brief return to Rome in November 1938 and another that saw him arrive in Rome on 25 November 1939. He left from there to France in order to return to the mission via boat but learnt on 8 December that he had been nominated as the Bishop of Andria and so returned to Rome. He failed four times to refuse the nomination.
Di Donna received his episcopal consecration on 31 March 1940 in the San Crisogono basilica in Rome from Cardinal Carlo Rossi (now a Servant of God) with Celso Benigno Luigi Costantini (now a Servant of God) and Francesco Petronelli serving as the co-consecrators. He was enthroned in his new episcopal see over a month after his consecration and began his apostolate. His installation came in the midst of pouring rain but the first thing he did upon getting out of the car before the Mass was to kiss the land; this action led to spontaneous applause from the faithful. He donated his goods to the poor and ill and recommended that his priests give frequent catechism lessons to the faithful so as to ensure people grew in their understanding of the faith. He also promoted the Azione Cattolica movement. On 15 July 1940 he consecrated his diocese to the Sacred Heart of Jesus due to the outbreak of World War I and the announcement that Benito Mussolini had pledged the Italian kingdom's involvement in the war on the side of the Axis powers.
In late August 1951 he was en route home to his diocese from a pilgrimage in Lourdes when a sudden illness overcame him. In Bari he was later diagnosed with pulmonary neoplasia with metastasis to the vertebral column. His condition grew so grave that on 15 December he received the last sacraments in anticipation of his death even though he struggled on for a little while longer. Di Donna died on 2 January 1952 at 2:28pm due to his disease with Father Stefano Savanelli at his side; the funeral was celebrated on 5 January.
Beatification process.
The beatification process was launched in his old diocese in an informative process that was inaugurated on 30 November 1956 and was closed a decade later on 4 July 1966; the contents of the overall investigation was then sent to the Congregation for Rites in Rome for evaluation. But the cause remained dormant until 18 October 1991 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the informative process and in 1993 received the Positio from the postulation for additional research and assessment. Theologians advising the C.C.S. did not meet to discuss and approve the dossier until over a decade after on 7 November 2006 with the C.C.S. also confirming the cause on 15 April 2008. Di Donna was later proclaimed as Venerable on 3 July 2008 after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that the late bishop had lived a model life of heroic virtue.
The current postulator for this cause is the Trinitarian priest Javier Carnerero Peñalver.

Kandy (horse)

Kandy (foaled 1929 – after 1943) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In a racing career which lasted for two months in the spring of 1932 she won one race from three starts. After finishing unplaced on her debut she was sent to England and recorded a 33/1 upset victory in the 1000 Guineas. She was retired from racing after running unplaced in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches les than a month later. She has been described as one of the worst horses ever to win a British classic race. As a broodmare, however, she did produce one very good horse in the form of the South African champion Kipling.
Background.
Kandy was a bay mare bred in France by her owner Evremond de Saint-Alary and trained by Frank Carter. The filly was named after the city of Kandy in what was then known as Ceylon.
She was sired by Alacantara, who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1911 and was twice the Leading sire in France. Kandy's dam Kiao Tchau was a daughter of Kizil Kourgan, an outstanding racemare who won the Grand Prix de Paris in 1902. Her other descendants included the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Ksar. The identity of Kiao Tchau's sire is uncertain. In the year before she was born, her dam was covered by two stallions, Alcantara and Chouberski. Second coverings only usually occur if the first cover was unsuccessful and it is therefore likely that Kiao Tchau was sired by Chouberski. If the mare was sired by Alcantara, then Kandy's pedigree was an example of extreme inbreeding.
Racing career.
1932: three-year-old season.
Kandy was slow to mature and did not run as a juvenile in 1931 although she was entered in many of the following season's best races, suggesting that she was regarded as having some potential. On her first racecourse appearance in the early spring of 1932 she ran very poorly and finished unplaced, leading her owner to cancel most of her entries. Owing to a clerical oversight however, her entry in the 1000 Guineas was allowed to stand. In training gallops in France the filly showed no discernable ability until Carter opted to try her over a long, straight course (similar to Newmarket's Rowley Mile) and noticed considerable improvement. The filly was therefore sent to England and temporarily joined the Clarehaven stable of Victor Gilpin at Newmarket.
On 29 of April Kandy was ridden by Charlie Elliott in the 119th running of the 1000 Guineas and started a 33/1 outsider in a nineteen-runner field. She won by a length from Thorndean with Safe Return (Molecomb Stakes) a length back in third.
On he return to France Kandy was made favourite for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in May but never looked likely to win and finished unplaced behind Ligne de Fond. She was retired from racing shortly afterwards.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Kandy the "worst" winner of the 1000 Guineas in the 20th century.
Breeding record.
As a broodmare, Kandy produced at least three foals between 1936 and 1943:

2018 Canadian Soccer League season

The 2018 Canadian Soccer League season was the 21st season under the Canadian Soccer League name. The season began on May 13, 2018 and concluded on October 13, 2018 with the CSL Championship final held at Centennial Park Stadium in Toronto, Ontario. FC Vorkuta won their first championship by defeating Scarborough SC in a penalty shootout. Vorkuta found further success in the Second Division by winning their first CSL double after defeating Halton United in the finals. Meanwhile FC Ukraine United claimed the First Division title. 
The First Division saw an increase to 9 teams, while the Second Division decreased in size to 6 teams. The First Division returned to the territories of Hamilton, Mississauga, and the promotion of FC Ukraine United. While new entries to the Second Division included the return of Milton SC, and the debut of Scarborough SC's reserve squad. 
Summary.
The main narrative of the season was the race for the First division title between FC Ukraine United and FC Vorkuta. The outcome was determined on the final match of the season with Ukraine United edging Vorkuta out with a higher goal differential by five goals. Though Vorkuta would achieve success in the postseason by claiming its first CSL Championship. The organization made further advances in the Second division as its reserve squad secured the double (division title and DII Championship). In preparation for the season Vorkuta managed to secure Ukraine United's general manager Denys Yanchuk and continued in the club's practice of foreign recruitment from the Ukrainian football market. 
After producing a perfect season in the Second division Ukraine United returned to the top division in 2018. Andrei Malychenkov resumed his coaching duties, and retained the majority of his previous roster with additional imports from the Ukraine. From the onset of the season the club remained highly competitive, and battled with rivals Vorkuta for supremacy of the division. Vorkuta held the top position for sixteen consecutive weeks until Ukraine United usurped the position for the final five weeks of the season. The western Toronto team ultimately reached the second round of the playoffs and succumbed to Scarborough SC. 
The third position in the First division was a highly contested spot with Hamilton City, Scarborough SC, Serbian White Eagles, and SC Waterloo Region competing with one another. The White Eagles achieved a five game undefeated streak and held the spot for two weeks. Shortly their performance dwindled and fluctuated between the fourth and fifth position to conclude the season in the sixth spot. Following their mediocre 2017 season SC Waterloo named Radivoj Panić as the head coach, and assembled a roster with a mixture of league veterans with European imports from the Western Balkans. After a slow start to the season the club rebounded to a seven match undefeated streak, and secured the third position on the final match of the regular season. 
Scarborough SC continued to develop as an elite club with Zoran Rajović being assigned head coach responsibilities. Rajović took advantage of the influx of European imports to the league, and a player agreement to acquire talent from York Region Shooters was negotiated. One notable re-signing was the return of Canadian international Adrian Cann as team captain. The acquisitions produced dividends for the eastern Toronto club as they held the coveted third position for the majority of the season for a total of sixteen weeks until forfeiting it on the final week to Waterloo on an account of a greater goal difference. In the postseason the club reached the championship final for the second consecutive season. 
After a year hiatus from the league Hamilton City returned under new management with Saša Vuković as owner and head coach. The club experienced a transitional stage with fewer imports from abroad and more reliance on talent from their previous reserve team. Hamilton managed to produce an average season enough to secure a playoff berth with just four points away from the third position. The final two postseason berths were secured by Brantford Galaxy, and SC Real Mississauga. After the departure of Vukovic the Galaxy brought in Milan Prpa as head coach and the team assembled by Prpa remained primarily the same as the previous seasons with many veterans returning. 
The season also witnessed the return of professional soccer to the Peel Region with CSC Mississauga and SC Real Mississauga representing the city of Mississauga. Real Mississauga, an academy founded by league veteran Krum Bibishkov, received a franchise in the CSL. They primarily competed with Brantford throughout the season and secured a playoff berth. CSC Mississauga struggled to make an impact as they remained at the bottom of the standings for the majority of the season. In the Second division Burlington SC were renamed Halton United, and were the primary competitors to FC Vorkuta B. For eleven weeks Halton retained the second position and reached the championship final. 
First Division.
Changes from 2017.
Club membership increased in the First Division from eight members to nine. Changes included the return of FC Ukraine United from the Second Division with further new additions from two Mississauga franchises CSC Mississauga, and Real Mississauga SC. The division also saw the return of Hamilton City SC from its one year hiatus under new club management. The York Region Shooters failed to feature an active squad for the season as owner Tony De Thomasis became involved with Unionville Milliken SC in League1 Ontario.

Ford-GM 10-speed automatic transmission

This transmission is part of a joint-venture between Ford Motor Company and General Motors to design and engineer two transmissions, a longitudinal 10-speed transmission and a transverse 9-speed trans-axle. Each company will manufacture its own unique version of the transmissions in their own factories. The 10-speed transmission was designed by Ford, while GM designed the 9-speed transmission which is used in transverse applications.
Specifications.
Abstract.
A unique triple-clutch assembly on a dedicated intermediate shaft, placed in the middle of the architecture, replaces two ordinary clutches and is the key for packaging the 10-speed trans into the same space as previous transmissions. The transmission provides small steps between each gear ratio, improving performance and maximizing engine power during acceleration. A wide gear ratio spread and a lower numerical top gear ratio reduces engine speed at vehicle highway speeds, resulting in improved efficiency.
Production.
The 10R80 was first produced at the Ford Livonia Transmission Plant in Livonia, Michigan, and the Hydra-Matic 10L80 is made at the General Motors Romulus Powertrain Plant, in Romulus, Michigan. Ford's Sharonville Transmission plant started 10R80 production in 2018 and is scheduled to start 10R140 production in 2019.

Ga-Maphalle Village

Ga-Maphalle ("also known as Pipa") is a village situated along the R81 road between Mooketsi and Giyani towns in Bolobedu area. It is one of the villages under the reign of Her royal Highness Queen Modjadji revered for her alleged ability to bring down rain.
The village is famous for its fruit &amp; vegetable market, situated in the village's business area. The market serves as a bus stop for long distance buses and taxis.
Culture &amp; Beliefs.
Khikhapa
Khikhapa is a traditional singing and dancing performed by Balobedu women. Fully dressed in Khilobedu attire, the dancers form a circle around the drummers. The dancing happens during specific village occasions and normally attracts large crowds of spectators from around the village.
Dinaka
Dinaka is a musical composition performed by elderly men. With wooden flutes and hypes and drums, they come together during occasions - usually this would be concurrent with Khikhapa dancing - and compose different cultural songs.
Khilaphatha
Khilaphatha was Botha dance and a ritual. The ritual was performed by elderly men (even women), who would gather around village water reservoirs - usually dams half naked to sing and dance to welcome seasonal rains. It is believed that the ritual itself was able to bring down rain. Khilaphatha has long been discontinued with the advent of stands.
Demographics.
There are three main spoken languages: Khilobedu, Xitsonga and Tshivenda. Khilobedu form the larger part of the population (about 80%), followed by Xitsonga speaking people with about 18% and the Tshivenda speaking group taking the remaining 2%.
Public Facilities.
Clinic
The clinic is situated in business area, next to MT's Eating House along the R81 road. It is open 24/7.
Library
The library is built near the chief's headquarters (Khorone), also closer to the main road.
Schools.
Pipa Primary School
The oldest school in the village and the prestigious primary school in its circuit, Pipa is situated opposite the market along the R81 road. Mr. S Makgalo is the current principal.
Modisha Secondary School
Modisha was established in 1990 to cater for three villages, namely: Maphalle (under the leadership of chief Modika), Ditshosine and Shawela. The name was coined using the first two letters of Modika, Ditshosing and Shawela.
Both schools have adopted Sepedi as their home language. This is due to the fact that, despite the major differences between the two languages and the massive number of people who speak Khilobedu, the language was left out in 1996 when languages were recognized as official languages of South Africa.
Recreational.
There are two popular recreational facilities in the village. 
Tshepisho Pools 
Tshepisho Pools is situated closer to the R81 road, the village clinic and the market. 
Gwegwe Resort 
Gwegwe resort lies between ga-Maphalle and Blinkwater village. 
Sections.
The village is subdivided into four major sections namely: Nkwelemotse, Polantane, Nyakelane and Nanedi.
History.
The village came about as a result of the movement of people at the time when black people were forced to vacate their lands to be grouped in Bantu stands in the late 60's (between 1965 and 1969). 
Formally known as Pipa village, there are varying versions of how it came to be known as ga-Maphalle village. All the versions are linked with a known family by the same surname who were the first to live closer to the R81 road. As a result, recounts the popular version, the family was used as a reference for public transport users. The name was later registered as the official name of the village instead of Pipa.

Block'hood

Block'hood is a city-building video game developed by Plethora Project and published by Devolver Digital. It was released on 11 May 2017 for Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux.
Gameplay.
"Block'hood" is a neighbourhood building simulator. It involves building a vertical tower for people to live in by combining square building blocks. There are over 200 different building blocks each serving different purposes and requiring different resources. Every block has inputs which are resources it consumes and outputs which are resources it produces. Resources such as Energy and Food must be managed, and if a building block doesn't have all its required resources it will decay and need to be replaced. To produce more resources blocks such as Wind Turbines, Farms and Water towers can be built. Other blocks that are available include: Flats which can house inhabitants, Parks that provide fresh air, Shops that produce money and Clinics that reduce sickness.
The game is intended to be partially educational so it incorporates real world mechanics. When building all blocks must be accessible which can be achieved by adding stairs and corridors. The buildings must also be architecturally sound, for example corridors must be supported before they can built upon.
There is a story mode with 5 chapters that also serves as the initial tutorial to the game. Additional tutorials are included that cover more complex mechanics of the game. There is a challenge mode where there are 24 challenges to complete, which involve producing a specified number of resources given a limited amount of money or other resources. The sandbox mode allows a neighbourhood to be built in an area of customisable size, inhabitants demands and random events can be left on or turned off in this mode.
Development.
"Block'hood" was first released for early access on 10 March 2016 for Microsoft Windows and MacOS. On 13 March 2016, a bug fix was published. On 30 March 2016, new features were released including a new UI to inspect block properties, Pigs and Cows were added as well as new farms. On 27 April 2016, Inhabitants were added to the game along with new building blocks. On 25 May 2016, more inhabitants were added, as well as new challenge levels and more new building blocks. Plethora Project went to E3 in June 2016 to represent the game on MacOS. The game won an award for Best Gameplay at the "Games for Change" festival in June 2016. More new features including a world system enabling a larger neighbourhoods were released on 11 July 2016. On 11 August 2016, an update improving the menu system and user interface was released. On 14 October 2016, all 200 building blocks were available and dynamic effects like wind and rain were published. On 5 December 2016, inhabitants demands were added. The first Linux version of the game was released on 18 December 2016. The full version of the game was released on 11 May 2017, which included a new story game mode. Further bug fixes were applied on 11 and 21 July 2017. The game is built on the Unity3D game engine.

2018–19 Egyptian Premier League

The 2018–19 Egyptian Premier League, also known as The WE League for sponsorship purposes, was the 60th season of the Egyptian Premier League, the top Egyptian professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1948. The season started on 31 July 2018 and concluded on 28 July 2019. Fixtures for the 2018–19 season were announced on 8 July 2018.
El Gouna, Nogoom and Haras El Hodoud entered as the promoted teams from the 2017–18 Egyptian Second Division. They replaced El Raja, Tanta and Al Nasr who were relegated to the 2018–19 Egyptian Second Division.
Defending champions Al Ahly won their 4th consecutive and 41st overall Egyptian Premier League title on 24 July 2019, following their 3–1 away win against Al Mokawloon Al Arab.
Overview.
Fans return to the stadiums.
From this season on, the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) officially allowed the fans to attend league matches again, after they showed great discipline while attending non-league matches in the previous years. The EFA banned all fans from attending all matches back in February 2012, where the Port Said Stadium riot occurred during Al Masry and Al Ahly match in the 2011–12 Egyptian Premier League, which resulted in the death of 72 Al Ahly fans, 1 Al Masry fan and 1 police officer. All Egyptian Premier League fixtures since then was played behind closed doors, and sometimes with a group of people who were invited by the clubs involving in a match.
Al Masry return to Port Said.
From this season on, the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) was supposed to allow Al Masry to play all local home matches at Al Masry Club Stadium (previously known as Port Said Stadium) in Port Said, after the club successfully acquired the stadium from the Governorate of Port Said on 5 January 2016. However the local security authorities refused this decision, and the club ended up playing their home matches at various stadiums in different cities. The EFA banned Al Masry Club Stadium from hosting all football or sport activities after the Port Said Stadium riot occurred in 2012, and Al Masry played all of their local matches, both home and away, at Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria and at Ismailia Stadium in Ismailia for African matches since then.
Al Assiouty Sport takeover.
On 18 June 2018, Mahmoud Al Assiouty, president of Al Assiouty Sport, announced that the club was officially sold to two investors from Saudi Arabia. The club name was changed to Pyramids Football Club, and the deal was later confirmed on 27 June 2018.
Nogoom El Mostakbal rebranding.
On 29 July 2018, just two days before the start of the season, Nogoom El Mostakbal announced on their official Facebook page that the club name has been changed to Nogoom Football Club. Club president Mohamed El Tawila stated that the decision to rename the club came after they reached their goal by promoting to the Egyptian Premier League for the first time. The old name, Nogoom El Mostakbal, in Arabic, means "Future Stars", and the new name, Nogoom, means "Stars".
Teams.
Eighteen teams competed in the league - the top fifteen teams from the previous season, and three teams promoted from the Second Division.
Teams promoted to the Egyptian Premier League
The first team to be promoted was Haras El Hodoud from Group C, following their 1–0 away win against Al Hammam on 10 April 2018. The Alexandrian side managed to return to the Premier League after staying only two season in the Second Division, and participated in the top flight for the fifteenth time in their history.
The second team to be promoted was El Gouna from Group A, following their 1–0 away win against Al Salam on 11 April 2018. El Gouna earned a spot in the Premier League for the fifth time in the club's history, having played four seasons in the top flight before with the 2014–15 season being the most recent.
The third team to be promoted was Nogoom (which was known as Nogoom El Mostakbal during that time) from Group B, following their 1–0 home win against Montakhab Suez on 18 April 2018. Nogoom managed to secure the promotion spot after a fierce contest that lasted until the last day of the league with Tersana, who lost 1–0 to Gomhoriat Shebin on the same day to confirm the promotion of Nogoom El Mostakbal to the Premier League for the first time in the club's history.
Teams relegated to the Egyptian Second Division
The first club to be relegated was Al Nasr, who suffered an immediate return to the Second Division following a 2–1 away defeat to Al Masry on 12 April 2018.
The second club to be relegated was Tanta, their stay in the Premier League came to an end after spending only two season in the top flight following a 1–2 home defeat to Al Masry on 21 April 2018.
The third club to be relegated was El Raja, who also suffered an immediate return to the Second Division after Wadi Degla managed to secure the last safe spot in the Premier League following a 2–1 home win against El Entag El Harby on 21 April 2018.
Foreign players.
Clubs can have a maximum of four foreign players registered during the season. Clubs cannot sign foreign players unless these players have played in the first or second tier in their countries. Clubs also cannot sign any foreign goalkeepers. In addition, each club can register a total of two players from Palestine or Syria; those players were be treated as Egyptians, and won't count as foreign players.
Results.
Positions by round.
The table lists the positions of teams after each week of matches. In order to preserve chronological evolvements, any postponed matches were not included in the round at which they were originally scheduled, but added to the full round they were played immediately afterwards. For example, if a match was scheduled for matchday 13, but then postponed and played between days 16 and 17, it was added to the standings for day 16.

Sacred Heart Church-Punahou

Sacred Heart Church-Punahou is located at 1701 Wilder Avenue, in Honolulu, in the U.S. state of Hawaii. The church was dedicated in 1914, and its adjacent Bachelot Hall was dedicated in 1923. The property's rectory was built in 1927. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on February 6, 2001.
Background.
The church body was established by French priest Father Clement Evrard. He arrived from Bremen, Germany at Honolulu Harbor on Oahu on March 19, 1864, on the same ship as Father Damien and a number of Sisters of the Sacred Hearts. He was ordained in Honolulu by Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands Louis Désiré Maigret, and initially sent to Kohala along with Damien. In 1881, Clement was reassigned to Saint Louis College in Honolulu, and subsequently started a mission in the Portuguese area of the city. In time, he erected the Sacred Heart chapel. 
Father (later Bishop) Stephen Alencastre, of Portuguese ancestry, attended both Saint Louis College and Sacred Heart Chapel as a youth. After training for the priesthood at Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, he returned to Hawaii in 1902 and was ordained at the chapel.
Architecture.
After Father Clement died in 1909, Father Stephen assumed his duties, and commissioned Honolulu architect E. A. P. Newcomb to design a new structure to replace the chapel. The two-story Gothic Revival building, with stained glass windows designed in France, was dedicated November 1, 1914, in a ceremony presided over by Vicar Apostolic and Bishop of Zeugma Libert H. Boeynaems. At that time, the Bishop officially named Father Stephen as pastor of Sacred Heart.
Newcomb and Guylor R. Miller designed Bachelot Memorial Hall, which was completed and dedicated June 23, 1923, with an address by Governor Wallace Rider Farrington. The hall was named after Alexis John Augustine Bachelot, Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. His 1827 arrival established the first permanent Catholic mission in the Kingdom of Hawaii.
The 1927 two-story Mediterranean Revival style rectory was designed by Rothwell, Kangeter &amp; Lester, and constructed by Walker &amp; Olund. The three buildings were constructed in such a way as to create a private open space with convenient access to all.
The Sacred Heart complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on February 6, 2001.

5th Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry

The 5th Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (5th Bn KOYLI), was a unit of Britain's Territorial Force formed in 1908 from Volunteer units originally raised in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1860. It served in some of the bitterest fighting on the Western Front during World War I, leading the attack at the tank battle of Cambrai and defending Bucquoy in March 1918. In the late 1930s, the battalion was converted to air defence in which role it served during World War II in the Battle of France and the Dunkirk evacuation, in North Africa including the Second Battle of El Alamein, and in the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, including service in the rebellion in Greece. Postwar, its successor units served in Anti-Aircraft Command until 1955.
Origin.
The battalion was formed in 1908 when the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms. The existing 2nd Volunteer Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment was split up: the companies from Rotherham and Barnsley became 5th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, while the companies from Doncaster and Pontefract combined with two companies from the 1st Volunteer Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI) to form the 5th Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry.
By 1914, the new battalion was organised as follows:
Together, the TF battalions of the KOYLI and the York and Lancasters constituted the 3rd West Riding Brigade in the West Riding Division.
World War I.
Mobilisation.
Towards the end of July 1914, the units of the West Riding Division left their headquarters for their annual training camps, but on 3 and 4 August they were ordered to return; on 4 August immediate mobilisation was ordered. The 5th KOYLI mobilised at Frenchgate, Doncaster, under Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. Moxon, TD, who had been commanding officer (CO) since 8 October 1912.
Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and the majority of the battalion did so. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix while the parent unit took '1/'. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right, and 3rd Line or Reserve units were formed.
1/5th Battalion.
After mobilisation, the 1st West Riding Division concentrated in the South Yorkshire area and began training for war. In November the KOYLI battalions were at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, then in February 1915 at York. On 31 March the division was informed that it had been selected to proceed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and the battalion landed at Boulogne on 12 April. On 18–19 April platoons from the 3rd West Riding Bde were attached to 8th Division for training in the routine of trench duties. On 28 April the West Riding Division took over its own section of the line at Fleurbaix. It now formed part of IV Corps, which attacked at the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May. While the other two divisions of IV Corps made the actual attack, the West Riding Division took over the greater part of the corps' trench line. It was supposed to follow up and occupy the captured enemy line, but the breakthrough did not occur.
On 12 May, the division was designated 49th (West Riding) Division and the brigade became 148th (3rd West Riding).
For the next nine months, the 49th Division took part in no major operations but was almost continuously engaged in day-to-day trench warfare, much of it in the Ypres Salient, with the considerable casualties that this entailed. On 19 December, the division received a sudden attack with the new German phosgene gas, followed by heavy shelling, but no serious infantry attack followed. In January 1916, the division was withdrawn for its first period of complete rest since it first entered the line.
Somme.
In February, the division moved to the Somme sector. Here, it spent the next few months alternating trench duties with working parties and training for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. For this, the 49th Division formed the reserve for X Corps, which was tasked with seizing the Thiepval Spur, after which the 49th was to pass through and continue the pursuit. 148 Brigade moved up to assembly trenches in Aveluy Wood before dawn on the day of the attack (1 July). The attack was a disaster along most of the line, but the 36th (Ulster) Division initially made good progress. By the end of the day, it was cut off in the German lines, with its flank open to attack from Thiepval. 148 Brigade was ordered to make a second attack on Thiepval at midnight with 1/4th and 1/5th KOYLI. However, at 23.30 it became clear that the survivors of the Ulsters had retired to their original front trenches and the attack was called off.
By 14 July, the British had taken the Leipzig Redoubt on the Thiepval Spur, and while the offensive continued 49th Division remained holding this area, with a number of small actions and suffering a good deal of shelling, at the same time preparing trenches and dumps for a renewed attack. This was made on 3 September at the end of the Battle of Pozières, but 1/5th KOYLI was not directly involved in the failed action. 49th Division continued minor operations towards Thiepval during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15–22 September) before the offensive petered out.
Ypres.
During the summer of 1917, the 49th Division was earmarked for operations along the Flanders coast that failed to materialise. In October it was moved to the Ypres sector to join the Third Ypres Offensive. It took part in the Battle of Poelcapelle on 9 October, with 148 Bde on the left and 146 (1st West Yorkshire) Bde in the centre of the attack. The troops had a long night approach march in rain across appalling ground under shellfire, and only just reached the jumping-off tapes in time for Zero. When the attack went in at 05.20, the rain stopped so that the German defenders had perfect visibility. 148 Brigade was immediately stopped by a flooded stream, leaving 146 Bde to advance alone. They managed a few hundred yards before being stopped by a broad belt of undamaged German barbed wire. The division was now pinned down under fire from artillery, riflemen hidden in shell craters, and from machine guns in German pillboxes on the higher ground ahead. Although some of these pillboxes were taken, the division's attacking troops were back at their start line by the afternoon, having suffered heavy casualties.
By the beginning of 1918, the BEF was suffering a manpower crisis and the decision was made to break up one battalion in each infantry brigade. 1/5th KOYLI was the battalion chosen in 148 Bde: some of the men were drafted to the 1/4th Bn, the remainder joined 2/5th Bn in 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division ("see below") which thereafter became simply 5th KOYLI.
2/5th Battalion.
The 2/5th Bn KOYLI was formed at Doncaster on 10 September 1914 and became part of the 2/3rd West Riding Bde in the 2nd West Riding Division. These were later numbered 187 Bde and 62nd Division respectively.
Until April 1915, they had no weapons with to train. Some Lee-Enfield rifles were then received, but these were withdrawn in May, and until the beginning of 1916 the 2nd Line Territorials had to make do with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles, keeping their ammunition in their pockets until 1914 pattern webbing equipment arrived. With these antiquated weapons the 62nd Division was under orders to move at short notice to defend the East Coast, for which railway trains were kept in readiness. Training was also disrupted by the frequent calls to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1st line serving on the Western Front. In May 1915, the Home Service men of 187 Bde were withdrawn to form 26th Provisional Battalion serving in coast defence in North East England. In October, the division's 2nd Line battalions were reduced to 600 all ranks, the unfit men being posted to the 26th Provisional Bn and the surplus to the 3rd Line, which became the draft-finding unit.
In May 1915, the division moved into camp in 'The Dukeries' area of Nottinghamshire, where it trained until October, when it concentrated round Retford. It then went into the Tyne defences where it dug an entrenched defence line in December. It moved to Larkhill Camp on Salisbury Plain for battle training in January 1916 and finally received SMLE Mk III rifles and Lewis guns, but in June it was sent to the East Coast defences once more, where it was scattered round East Anglia. Here battle training was less convenient and it was again called upon to provide drafts to the Western Front. In October, it moved inland to Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire.
Finally, in October 1916, orders were received to bring the division up to full establishment and prepare for overseas service. Embarkation began at Southampton on 5 January 1917, and the division completed its concentration in France on 18 January. It took its place in the line in the Somme sector opposite Serre. Shortly afterwards, the German army began a planned retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) and from 15 February to 19 March the division's units were engaged in patrol work and stiff actions against rearguards while advancing across the devastated (and booby-trapped) ground until that line was reached. The division was then shifted to the line opposite Bullecourt in the southern part of the Arras sector.
Bullecourt.
Part of 62nd Division was involved in the failed first attack at Bullecourt on 11 April and in repulsing the German counter-attack at Lagnicourt on 15 April, but 187 Bde was not engaged in major action until the main Battle of Bullecourt opened on 3 May. The division spent the preceding 17 days in rehearsals and the whole division attacked in waves behind tanks and a heavy barrage, with 187 Brigade on the left. The first wave (the two battalions of York &amp; Lancasters) advanced at 03.37 (eight minutes before Zero) to cross of No man's land, with 2/5th KOYLI under Lt-Col W. Watson and two companies of 2/4th KOYLI in support. They reached the first German line but had lost cohesion before they reached the second. Brigade HQ ordered a second attack in two waves, but this 'ended miserably in shell-holes' and at about 16.00 the division withdrew to a railway embankment where it was relieved. It was not until 17 May that the division finally cleared the village, and operations against the Hindenburg Line continued until 28 May.
After rest and reorganisation, 62nd Division returned to the line in June and began a period of several months of trench-holding.
Cambrai.
62nd Division moved into hutments at Beaulencourt in October 1917, where it trained for open warfare in preparation for the forthcoming Battle of Cambrai, including training with the Tank Corps at Wailly. In its attack on Havrincourt, 187 Bde was to be supported by G Battalion Tank Corps. 2/5th KOYLI was to be preceded by 12 Mark IV tanks (8 fighting tanks and 4 wire-cutters). It was intended that these would help deal with the outpost line then advance in single file up a road to the left of 'Yorkshire Bank'. Two tanks would then go on up the road to help a bombing squad deal with a strongpoint known as 'Etna', while the rest turned left and advanced in line abreast to lead the infantry onto the objective. On the night of 17/18 November 187 Bde took up its positions in Havrincourt Wood.
The surprise attack was launched at dawn on 20 November, with no preceding bombardment; the artillery crashed down on its targets at zero hour. As planned, 2/5th Bn advanced at zero to deal with the outposts, but six of its tanks failed to start (four broken down, one 'bellied' on a tree stump, and one 'ditched') The Etna strongpoint was dealt with by one platoon of 2/5th and two from 2/4th KOYLI on their right. When the battalion delivered its main assault 15 minutes later, it was followed by the six remaining tanks (one reserve tank had arrived, but one had been knocked out on the start line), which had been unable to get forward quickly enough to take the lead. (The delay had been anticipated, so Captain Lynn and 2/Lt James of the 2/5th Bn had marked the gaps in the German wire the night before, rather than wait for the tanks.) The battalion was involved in sharp hand-to-hand fighting in the Hindenburg front trenches and then continued, with its left following the Canal du Nord. One tank had been knocked out soon after crossing the Hindenburg front line, leaving five to support the infantry. By 08.30, the battalion was on its first objective (the Blue Line). The second wave of 187 Bde then leapfrogged through to take the Brown Line by 10.00, and at 11.30 the 186th (2/2nd West Riding) Brigade passed through to the next objective at Graincourt with the surviving tanks. Further progress was held up by the failure of 51st (Highland) Division to take Flesquières, leaving 62nd Division's right flank uncovered.
The divisional objective for the second day of the attack (21 November) was Bourlon Wood, for which 187 Bde was in reserve. However, there were fewer tanks available and progress was slower than on the first day. Anneux was taken but Bourlon Wood remained out of reach. A dawn counter-attack by the Germans on 22 November ended any further advances. 62nd Division was relieved by 40th Division in a tricky operation that night.
The division was back in Bourlon Wood on 27 November for another attempt to complete its capture. 187 Brigade led on the left at 06.20 with 16 of the remaining tanks to take Bourlon Village. 2/5th KOYLI and 2/5th York &amp; Lancasters followed 11 tanks of F Battalion, Tank Corps. Four tanks and a KOYLI company were to cover the left flank by dealing with machine gun posts in the Marcoing Line. It was dark and snowing: the infantry had difficulty keeping up with the creeping barrage and when the tanks and infantry entered Bourlon they found the village a network of formidable defences hardly touched by the shellfire. The flanking party lost its direction and failed, so that the rest of the battalion was badly hit by enfilade fire from the left. After two hours' fighting the battalion was driven out of Bourlon. It was relieved at the end of the day. The division had however succeeded in taking the last of Bourlon Ridge, which had been fought over for a week. The exhausted West Riding division was then relieved (under a hail of German gas shells) before the German counter-attack took back all the hard-won ground a few days later.
On 2 February 1918, the battalion absorbed the remnant of 1/5th Bn from 49th Division ("see above"), becoming simply 5th KOYLI from then on.
Bucquoy.
During the German spring offensive, 62nd Division was brought up from reserve on 26 March and became involved in the Battle of Bapaume when it took up defensive positions around Bucquoy and Rossignol Wood to cover the exits from Puisieux. The Germans resumed their attacks on 27 March, towards the end of which they began to exploit a gap between 62nd Division and the 4th Australian Brigade at Hébuterne to the south. At 19.00, Lt-Col Oliver Watson commanding 5th KOYLI was ordered to counter-attack Rossignol Wood with the assistance of four tanks. The counter-attack temporarily succeeded, but Germans continued to hold out in two improvised strongpoints among old trenches. Watson then led his remaining reserve in a series of bombing attacks under heavy fire. Eventually he had to order his men to retire, and was killed while covering their retreat. Watson was considered to have saved the division, and was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The following day 5th KOYLIs were finally pushed off the Hébuterne–Rossignol Wood ridge by German bombing parties, but the position was restored by the divisional reserve and the Australians, and the German advance was halted in the division's sector. The division was relieved on 28/29 March for rest and reorganisation.
Hundred Days Offensive.
In July, the 62nd Division counter-attacked under French command in the Battle of Tardenois. 187 Brigade led the right of the division at 08.00 on 20 July, attacking through thickly wooded country, and made slow progress, suffering heavy casualties as the men worked round stubborn German machine gun posts. At 10.30 the next day, the brigade attacked again to clear a strongpoint on a timbered spur south-west of the Bois du Petit Champ. Once this was accomplished the rest of the division could take the Bois du Petit Champ on 22 July and push on. The operation continued until 30 July.
The division then reverted to British command for the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, beginning with the Second Battle of Bapaume, when it effectively exploited a pre-dawn attack by 2nd Division on 25 August. 5th Battalion KOYLI was prominent in driving the Germans out of Mory, taking many prisoners. The division then attacked again in the afternoon of 29 August behind a creeping barrage. It continued with the Battle of the Drocourt-Quéant Line (2 September) and then advanced to the Hindenburg Line to participate in the Battle of Havrincourt on 12 September. 187 Brigade attacked on the right of the division, supported by heavy artillery, and within an hour of zero was sending back batches of prisoners. Four officers and 80 men had been captured at a strongpoint by Sergeant Laurence Calvert, MM, of 5th KOYLI, who had rushed the enemy machine gun teams single-handed, bayonetting three and shooting four. Calvert was also awarded the VC.
At the Battle of the Canal du Nord on 27 September, the division was tasked with passing through the first wave of attackers. 187 Brigade began moving forward early, but it was delayed helping the units in front to take Ribécourt, and so lost its creeping barrage. The division to the right failed to capture its objective, so 187 Bde could not advance much beyond Ribécourt. However, the following morning the attack was renewed on the right, and 187 Bde joined in at 04.35 as the barrage passed it. The previous day's third objective (Highland Ridge) was secured right up to the Hindenburg Support Line. It then took part in 62nd Division's main attack at 06.30, advancing towards Masnières on the Scheldt Canal, though it was checked by enemy fire once it reached the Marcoing Line. The attack was renewed at 18.30 that evening, and the brigade reached the canal bend and Marcoing Copse. The division continued to push on towards distant objectives on 30 September.
On 19–20 October, during the Battle of the Selle, 62nd Division had the task of taking Solesmes and clearing the bank of the River Selle. There was street fighting in Solesmes, but the troops waded across the Selle.
At the opening of the Battle of the Sambre on 4 November, 187 Bde's start was hampered by German counter-bombardment and mist. Resistance was slight at first, but stiffened as the advance continued. However, the division pushed on again in the afternoon, taking hundreds of prisoners, and continued the advance the following day. When the enemy seemed prepared to resist on a line from the Forêt de Mormal to Bermeries, the action of the 5th KOYLI advancing alongside 1st and 2nd Grenadier Guards and five Whippet tanks soon 'disposed of his desire for resistance'.
62nd Division remained in the front line, pushing its way toward the fortress of Maubeuge. 187 Brigade attacked at 06.30 on 8 November, making rapid progress and capturing Neuf-Mesnil by 08.00. However, at 08.45 it came under heavy fire from Fort Gravaux and a group of slag heaps. The brigadier decided to turn the position with his reserve battalion, 5th KOYLI, which attacked at 14.30 behind a barrage, clearing defended houses and securing the road and railway. Two attacks were made on Fort Gravaux during the night, and it was captured at the third attempt the following morning. 187 Brigade then cleared the southern suburbs of Maubeuge. Over the following two days, the division advanced slowly, with cavalry and cyclist patrols in front trying to find the retreating enemy. At 11.00 on 11 November hostilities ceased when the Armistice with Germany came into effect.
The division was selected to move into Germany and occupy bridgeheads on the Rhine, taking up its positions on 25 December. It was the only TF division to cross the frontier into Germany. From 21 February 1919. the infantry battalions were progressively relieved by other units and returned to England for demobilisation. 5th Battalion KOYLI was formally disembodied on 16 October 1919.
3/5th Battalion.
The 3/5th Bn was formed at Doncaster in March 1915 and then moved to Clipstone Camp in Nottinghamshire where its role was to train drafts for the 1st and 2nd Line battalions. On 8 April it was renamed the 5th Reserve Bn KOYLI and on 1 September it was absorbed by the 4th Reserve Bn.
27th Provisional Battalion.
In 1915, the Home Service men of the 5th KOYLIs, together with those of several other West Riding TF battalions, were combined into the 27th Provisional Battalion at York, which served in home defence with 2nd Provisional Brigade. It appears to have been disbanded before the Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit.
Interwar.
The TF reformed on 7 February 1920 (reorganising as the Territorial Army the following year), with 5th Bn KOYLI once again in 148th (3rd West Riding) Bde of 49th (West Riding) Division.
Anti-Aircraft conversion.
During the 1930s, the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units of the Royal Artillery (RA). In 1938, the battalion became 53rd (5th Bn King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, consisting of HQ, 157th, 158th and 159th Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) Batteries at Scarborough Barracks, Doncaster. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October. After Munich, the TA was rapidly doubled in size, many units forming duplicates in 1939 as they had in 1914. The 53rd formed 57th LAA Regiment, RA at Doncaster (it had KOYLI added to its official title on 17 February 1942) with 169, 170 and 171 LAA Btys. Both regiments were in Northern Command of Home Forces.
World War II.
53rd LAA Regiment.
The regiment was ordered to mobilise on 31 August 1939. It reported the progress of mobilisation and received instructions both through 49th (WR) Division in Northern Command and 50th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade of 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division in Anti-Aircraft Command (which had fully mobilised on 24 August). By 18.00 on 3 September – the day war was declared – it had a mobilised strength of 17 officers and 542 other ranks, only 1 officer and 16 other ranks short of its war establishment.
For the first few days after mobilisation, 157 and 158 Btys were billeted at the Central Schools in Danum Road, Doncaster, while Lewis and Bren light machine guns (LMGs) were set up for AA protection and the men dug air raid trenches in Elmfield Park. On 9 September, the regiment's first convoy of vehicles and Bofors 40 mm guns set off for a camp at Thursley near Aldershot. The regiment completed equipping and training at Thursley and at Bordon Camp, in preparation for joining the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. It sent its vehicles to Southampton Docks for transport to Cherbourg, and the main body went by train to Southampton on 29 September.
Battle of France.
The regiment spent the Phoney War period training and equipping in France. In October, it took delivery of some Vickers 2-pdr guns to supplement the Bofors and LMGs it already held. By November, it had 22 x Bofors and 28 x LMGs. The only event of note was a football match between the British and French armies in February, for which 157 LAA Bty provided AA cover with its seven available Bofors guns.
When the German invasion of the Low Countries began on 10 May, the BEF advanced into Belgium in accordance with 'Plan D'. 53rd (KOYLI) LAA Rgt, under the command of Lt-Col William Revell-Smith, was attached to II Corps and assigned to route protection at the river and canal crossings, where all three batteries came into action. Sergeant Parr of C Troop (157 Bty), brought down the regiment's first aircraft at Roubaix on 11 May. The regiment was bombed as it moved into Belgium on 12 May, but further enemy aircraft were brought down. As the Dyle line was occupied, the batteries were distributed among field gun positions and II Corps' HQ at Louvain.
However, the German breakthrough in the Ardennes turned the flank of the Dyle position and the BEF was compelled to retreat on 16 May. The batteries moved back in stages with II Corps, through Brussels to the line of the Escaut, engaging enemy aircraft "en route". Reaching the Escaut at Rugge on 19 May, the battery commander of 157 Bty blew the bridge. At Helchin, E Troop (158 Bty) became the rallying point for a Guards battalion that was falling back, while the gunners brought down a Henschel Hs 126 observing for German artillery. At one point the battery came across an intact battery of French AA guns that had been abandoned: they ensured that these were destroyed. Once across the river the regiment deployed behind 3rd Division, handing over all its small arms ammunition to help the infantry.
Between 21 and 23 May, the BEF retired again, from the Escaut to the canals along the Franco-Belgian frontier. By now, the BEF was cut off from the rest of France, a bridgehead was being organised around Dunkirk, and on 26 May the decision was made to evacuate the BEF through that port. II Corps ordered 53rd LAA Rgt's batteries to make their own way to Dunkirk to provide cover as formations gathered there, but they were caught up in the ground battle and took several days to make the journey. On the way, they fought a series of short AA actions but lost a third of their guns, damaged or immobilised on blocked roads. By 29 May, the regiment had 16 Bofors guns at the beaches. The AA commander placed 157 and 159 Btys under 2 AA Bde along the sea front and harbour, while the remains of 158 Bty were on the beach at La Panne. Ammunition was running low, but 157 Bty salvaged boxes that had been dumped in a dyke. All three batteries were in action against low-flying attacks by the "Luftwaffe" on 30 and 31 May, claiming more victims, but under fire and bombing themselves. HQ details and non-essential men embarked on 30 May, and on 31 May the batteries thinned out their strength to leave just five or six men with each gun. Finally, the remaining guns were disabled during the night of 31 May/1 June and the gun teams withdrew to the evacuation points. In three weeks of virtually continuous action, the regiment claimed to have shot down 28 enemy aircraft.
Home Defence.
The regiment's last details arrived in England at dawn on 1 June, 158 Bty aboard the minesweeper HMS "Hebe". AA units returning from France were rapidly reinforced, re-equipped where possible, and redeployed for future integration into existing defence plans. 53rd LAA Regiment went to Wimborne Minster, where it re-equipped with Bofors guns. It still formed a mobile part of Home Forces, and at New Year 1941 it joined the GHQ Reserve with its own signal section of the Royal Corps of Signals. By March, it had gained its own transport section of the Royal Army Service Corps In March 1942, the regiment transferred from the GHQ Reserve to direct War Office Control, preparatory to going overseas. It left the UK during July 1942.
Western Desert.
53rd LAA Regiment arrived in Egypt during the summer of 1942 as part of the reinforcements for Eighth Army. On 9 September it became the LAA regiment of 10th Armoured Division, which had just fought in the Battle of Alam el Halfa.
Over the next few weeks careful preparations were made for the Second Battle of El Alamein, which opened on the night of 23 October with Operation Lightfoot. 10th Armoured Division's role was to follow the infantry attack, clearing lanes through the enemy minefields, in order to pass through the following day. 53rd LAA Regiment, with 48 Bofors guns, was defending the division's columns as they moved up, apart from one Troop detached to guard X Corps' HQ. While preparing to start their break-out at 22.00 on 24 October, the division was hit by an air attack that left many vehicles blazing, which attracted further attacks. The division's armour had to disperse for protection, and only just reorganised and got through the minefield gaps by daybreak. The fighting continued for several days in what the British commander, Gen Bernard Montgomery, termed 'the dog-fight'. By the time the break-out attack () came on 1 November, 10th Armoured Division was out of the line, with much of its remaining amour lent to other formations.
10th Armoured Division was reconstituted for the pursuit after Alamein, but 53rd LAA Rgt was no longer with it, having left on 2 November. By January 1943 the regiment (with 36 Bofors guns) was in Libya with 2 AA Bde on tasks for XXX Corps. When the North African Campaign ended in May 1943 with the Axis surrender in Tunisia, the regiment was with 12 AA Bde, which had followed Eighth Army's advance for , supplying mobile AA groups to defend forward landing grounds for the Desert Air Force as they were captured. Bofors guns were frequently employed to 'sweep' with automatic fire when "Luftwaffe" fighter-bombers attacked out of the sun.
Italy.
53rd LAA Regiment's batteries began arriving in Sicily shortly after the Allied invasion (Operation Husky) began on 10 July 1943. The landing convoys came under attack from sea and air, and 157 LAA Bty lost 15 guns and all its vehicles when its ship was sunk in Syracuse harbour. As the campaign developed, the regiment came under the command of 73 AA Bde, which had detachments protecting airfields around Lentini, Gerbini, Agnone and Scordia, though vehicles were very short and mobility was limited.
Even before the capture of Sicily was complete, Eighth Army reorganised for its next operation (Baytown), the landing by XIII Corps on the 'toe' of Italy beginning on the night of 2/3 September. 53rd LAA Regiment was one of the units assigned to provide AA cover under 2 AA Bde. 158 LAA Battery was allocated to the initial landings on the beaches near Reggio, which came under dive-bombing attack. However, the landings went smoothly and by 5 September the whole regiment was protecting the beaches while the rest of 2 AA Bde moved on to Reggio and the airfields. As XIII Corps worked methodically through Calabria, 2 AA Bde's units followed up to cover the small harbours and airfields as they were captured.
Towards the end of September, 2 AA Bde was warned to concentrate its units for a move across Italy to protect the Foggia Airfield Complex, where it arrived on 30 September. For three weeks it was deployed around the main airfield and four satellite landing grounds, then on 27 October it moved forward again to a fresh group of airfields and a railhead in support of 1st Canadian Division, with a troop (6 guns) or battery (18 guns) at each airstrip. The campaign then bogged down and Allied forces were drawn away to the western side of Italy, leaving V Corps, supported by 2 AA Bde, to hold the eastern (Adriatic) front for many months. With little "Luftwaffe" activity, 2 AA Bde took every opportunity to use its guns in forward areas for non-AA tasks.
When fresh operations began on the Adriatic Front resumed in May 1944, 2 AA Bde moved up behind V Corps, mainly to protect landing-grounds and field gun areas. In July it reached Ancona and deployed its AA units around the city. At the beginning of August, 2 AA Bde HQ and most of its regiments drove across Italy to Anzio, while 53rd LAA Rgt temporarily joined 66 AA Bde. British forces in Italy were suffering a manpower shortage, and 53 LAA Rgt was one of several LAA units that were now retrained as infantry. It moved to Siena and began intensive training. When the enemy made a large scale withdrawal and X Corps was unable to follow up in strength, 2 AA Bde provided a minimum force to hold the line with 11th (City of London Yeomanry) and 53rd (KOYLI) LAA Rgts manning the front line while undergoing further infantry training. The regiment reorganised on the basis of three rifle companies and a support company equipped with 3-inch mortars.
In October, 2 AA Bde was relieved but 53rd LAA Rgt remained in the sector as infantry under the command of 7th Motor Brigade, holding a series of ridges as the most advanced unit of Eighth Army. It brought up some Bofors sections to act as heavy machine guns. At the end of October it reverted to 2 AA Bde and resumed its LAA role in support of XIII Corps and defending landing-grounds at Arezzo. There was little enemy air activity during the winter of 1944–45, and in LAA regiments were reduced from 54 to 36 Bofors guns, with the surplus men being reassigned. 53rd LAA Regiment spent three months operating a defensive smoke screen, firing mortars and Bofors in support of the forward infantry, and carrying stretchers.
In March, after a short rest, the regiment returned to the front around San Clemente and Valsenio, south of Imola, as Allied forces prepared for a new Spring 1945 offensive in Italy. 158 LAA Bty was detached to man 3-inch mortars in support of the Folgore Group of the Italian Co-belligerent Army. When the Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Sir John Harding and other officers visited 158 Bty's forward mortar positions, they were given lunch cooked by a peacetime hotel chef, served by a professional butler, who were among the gunners. This deployment lasted until the final surrender of the German armies in Italy at the end of April. The regiment then concentrated at Forlì and subsequently undertook occupation duties at Venice. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in September 1946.
57th LAA Regiment.
Like its parent unit, 57th LAA Regiment mobilised at Doncaster in Northern Command in September 1939. However, it was less advanced in training and equipment and was not ready for deployment overseas until May 1940.
In May/June 1940, while the Dunkirk evacuation was already under way, the regiment was deployed as follows under the command of Lt-Col Percy Calvert-Jones:
57th LAA Regiment reassembled at Blackdown, where it re-equipped with Bofors guns. In January 1941, the regiment joined the War Office Reserve, and left the UK for the Middle East in March.
Middle East.
On arrival, the regiment was sent to Palestine, in preparation for a campaign in Vichy French-controlled Syria and Lebanon (Operation Exporter). When the Anglo-Iraqi War broke out on 2 May, GHQ Middle East had no AA units to spare until 57th LAA Rgt arrived. 169 LAA Battery was then detached and made a journey across the desert, reaching RAF Habbaniya six days later. By then the siege of the airfield had been lifted and the situation in Iraq was in hand; a truce was arranged three days later. 169 LAA Battery then returned to Palestine, where the rest of the regiment was deployed to defend the port of Haifa and Lydda airfield.
Operation Exporter began on 8 June, with Allied forces moving north into Lebanon and Syria. 57th LAA Regiment moved up with the force as Corps Troops, with one battery on each of the three main lines of advance. With difficult terrain to cover and numerous tasks, the batteries were split up into separate troops or even 3-gun sections. The Vichy and German aircraft often remained out of Bofors range, but some LAA positions were involved in actions against Vichy tanks. A truce was agreed on 11 July and by the following month 57th LAA Rgt was back in Palestine.
Western Desert.
In October 1941, the regiment moved to the Western Desert where Eighth Army was preparing to launch Operation Crusader. It was attached to 4th Indian Division in XIII Corps, but A and B Troops were deployed with 4th South African Armoured Car Regiment in 7th Armoured Division (XXX Corps), C Trp with 1st Army Tank Brigade (XIII Corps), and D Troop with 1st Field Rgt, RA, of 4th Indian Division. Even within 4th Indian Division, the artillery units became scattered among the infantry brigades as the operation progressed. During the division's advance through Cyrenaica a mixed column protected by a troop of the regiment came under attack by six Junkers Ju 87 "Stukas" escorted by Italian Fiat CR.42 fighters. The Bofors guns opened up in a 'crash' action while still on their wheels, shooting down three Ju 87s. On another occasion a troop on the move was located by a Messerschmitt Bf 110 leading 14 Ju 87s, eight Messerschmitt Bf 109s and a few CR.42s. The first gun to halt shot down the Bf 110 with five rounds; the troop then took on the remainder and brought down four Ju 87s and one CR.42: a total of six 'kills' for 113 rounds fired.
The regiment's Bofors guns could also knock out light armour. On 3 December, 11 Indian Brigade Group was ordered to capture Point 182 near El Adem. After a long night march the attack was only partially successful, but a troop of 57th LAA Rgt disabled 16 tanks. On 14 December, 7th Indian Brigade Group was probing towards Alem Hamza when it was attacked by 39 German tanks; the Indian infantry was ordered to withdraw to leave the desert clear for the British tanks and artillery, including B Trp of 171 LAA Bty. Although the "Panzer" force overran a troop of 25th Field Rgt, it lost 14 tanks to the combined fire of field, anti-tank and LAA guns and withdrew. There were also failures when attackers gained successes through surprise or numbers, but by the end of the operation 57th LAA Rgt claimed a total of 103 aircraft and 10 tanks destroyed. From November 1941 to March 1942 it accounted for 130 enemy aircraft destroyed and 301 damaged, and destroyed or damaged 22 tanks.
After the failure of the Crusader offensive, 4th Indian Division was withdrawn from the front, but 57th LAA Rgt was attached to 1st Armoured Division just before the Battle of Gazala in May 1942.
By the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein, the regiment was back with 4th Indian Division, with 48 Bofors guns. As part of the deception plan for the battle, the regiment simulated an attack during Operation Lightfoot by firing tracer ammunition into a smokescreen laid over the German positions.
As Eighth Army drove across North Africa, the regiment with 169 and 170 Btys (now with the new establishment of 18 Bofors guns per battery) was loaned to 1 AA Bde in January 1943 to cover Benghazi, Agedabia and the Desert Air Force's landing grounds, while 171 Bty (still with 12 Bofors) was attached to 2 LAA Rgt on the same duty. On 17 March 1943, the regiment with all three batteries transferred back to the command of 4th Indian Division at Ben Gardane.
After the conclusion of the Tunisian Campaign, the regiment returned to Egypt with the division, arriving at Agami on 6 July. On 16 August, it passed to the command of 78 AA Bde in Twelfth Army and moved to Suez. On 6 October, it travelled to Syria to rejoin 4th Indian Division at Djeide, arriving on 16 October. After reorganisation, the division returned to Egypt, reaching Tahag on 5 November and embarking at Port Said on 2 December.
Italy and Greece.
57th LAA Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 9 December 1943 and remained with the division through the Italian campaign, including the bitter Battle of Monte Cassino. In July and August 1944 the division was clearing the mountain country approaching the Gothic Line, and then took part in Operation Olive against the Gothic Line outposts, capturing Gemmano on 15 September, pushing up to the Conca and clearing San Marino. This was followed by hard fighting at the crossing of the Marecchia (22–25 September).
On 10 October, it was decided that 4th Indian Division would be withdrawn from the fighting in Italy to become part of 'Manna Force', ready to land in Greece as the German troops there withdrew. Operation Manna got under way on 15 October, but the division was rested before its brigades were sent to Greece in turn. 57th LAA Rgt embarked at Taranto on 7 December with 5 Indian Brigade, disembarking at Piraeus, the port of Athens, on 13 December. Meanwhile, violent demonstrations (the "Dekemvriana") had broken out 10 days earlier, and the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) was in control of Piraeus when the troops arrived. There was considerable fighting for several days, with British detachments cut off. Men of 57th LAA Rgt slipped across the mouth of Piraeus Harbour to reinforce detachments of 64th LAA Rgt who were acting as infantry holding the oil installations and power station at St George's Bay. On the night of 20/21 December, these positions were mortared and attacked, but with the aid of star-shells and flares the LAA gunners beat them off. The following night, 5 Indian Brigade made an amphibious assault across the harbour and the area was secured by 27 December.
Even after the defeat of ELAS at Piraeus and Athens, tension was high in other areas. By 1 January 1945, 170 LAA Bty was at Salonika with 7 Indian Bde and 171 LAA Bty at Patras with 11 Indian Bde. RHQ and 169 LAA Bty arrived at Volos with 5 Indian Bde on 24 January. After a truce between the Greek government and the rebels was signed on 12 February, British forces were made responsible for disarming various rebel factions. 4th Indian Division was based at Salonika, with its troops covering western and eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace. 171 LAA Battery moved to Salonika on 26 February, and by 21 March the whole regiment was concentrated there under the divisional Commander, RA, until the end of the war.
The regiment was placed in suspended animation at Shirecliff Camp, Sheffield, on 5 January 1946.
Postwar.
When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the two regiments reformed at Doncaster as 553rd (KOYLI) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and 557th (KOYLI) (M) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment (the M indicating that it was a 'Mixed' unit with members of the Women's Royal Army Corps integrated into its personnel). Both regiments were in 65 AA Bde in Anti-Aircraft Command. On 1 January 1954, 557 HAA Rgt converted back to LAA as 557th (KOYLI) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.
AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 and there were wholesale amalgamations amongst its units. 65 AA Brigade was disbanded, and both 553 and 557 (KOYLI) LAA Rgts were merged into 323 (West Riding) LAA Rgt at Sheffield, to which 553 and 557 Rgts only contributed 'R' (KOYLI) Bty.

Riccardo Bianchi

Riccardo Bianchi (1854-1936) was an Italian engineer and the first Director-General of the Italian State Railways (FS), formed in 1905.
Overview.
Riccardo Bianchi was born at Casale Monferrato, in Piedmont on 20 August 1854. He did his studies and earned a degree in engineering in Turin and then gained practical experience in the railway workshops in Bologna where he obtained an industrial technical diploma. After graduation he worked in England for a while as a university scholar.
Early railway career.
In 1880 the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) launched a competition for engineers. He was ranked among the first fourteen on merit and was assigned to the Fixed Material Office of the Maintenance and Works Service. At the time, the devices in use were Saxby levers and rodding that, for the control of points, required considerable muscle strength. Bianchi studied an easier mechanism and devised a hydrodynamic command and control system using water mixed with glycerin which he patented on 18 September 1883. For the construction he collaborated with Ing. Giovanni Servettaz. The first Hydrodynamic Central Apparatus in the world for the operation of points and signals thus saw the light in the Abbiategrasso railway plant on 15 October 1886. It was a 10-lever system and the results were so good that it was extended to many other installations on the Italian network, and also abroad, and was used until after the Second World War.
In 1885, the SFAI became part of Rete Mediterranea and in 1891 Bianchi was appointed head of the Maintenance and Works Department and, in 1900, Director of the Movement and Traffic Service. On 22 July 1901 he became General Manager of Rete Sicula where he remained until the establishment of the FS in 1905.
With the coming of nationalization, Bianchi was appointed General Manager of the Ferrovie dello Stato by Giovanni Giolitti. Bianchi was respected as a man of great moral integrity and an enlightened and progressive manager, who paid great attention to technological innovation and efficiency. Giolitti, in his memoirs, recalled that, when asked what salary he wanted as General Manager of Ferrovie dello Stato, Bianchi surprised him by replying that the salary he enjoyed as general director of the Sicula Network would be enough.
Director General of the State Railways.
Settled in his new prestigious office he had to face great problems. Most of the lines, rolling stock and plant were in a state of neglect and decay. There were different and divergent regulations and provisions. The Adriatic Network had adopted Vignoles rail and the Hardy brake, while the Mediterranean Network used double-headed rail and the Westinghouse brake. Even the couplings were of different types.
In ten years Bianchi managed to standardize the regulations and the legal status of the staff. His decisive character led him to face business problems with an entrepreneurial approach. An example was the supply of coal, of British origin, which passed through various intermediaries. Bianchi, instead, set up his own office directly in Cardiff. Mediating at the ministries he managed to promote important investments to build large locomotive repair depots and important railway lines, such as Rome-Naples and Bologna-Florence, whose construction began during his tenure.
After having designed a unified architecture for new lines, he began work on extending the tracks, then of 15,000 km, of which less than one sixth was double track. He invested much effort in the development of electric lighting of vehicles and stations. The problem of shortage of rolling stock was tackled head-on, thanks to huge financing obtained from the Government for thousands of wagons and carriages, as well as new classes of technologically advanced steam locomotives. In just one year, he managed to acquire or build 567 locomotives, 1,244 coaches and 20,623 freight wagons, in one of the greatest improvement efforts ever seen in the history of Italian infrastructure.
His management style was sometimes controversial but this was justified by the fact that a large national enterprise had been established from nothing and he had to face significant problems of amalgamation and unification among the employees. On 24 January 1915, following disputes with the Minister of Transport on the occasion of an earthquake in the Marsican territory, Bianchi resigned from his post as general manager. The Bianchi management, however, had an extremely positive effect and created a railway administration that was competitive with those of other European nations. As a result of his appointment as Director General of the FS, the Italian Railway Engineers College had appointed him as its honorary president.
After the FS.
Appointed Senator of the Kingdom on 23 February 1917, he was called to hold the post of Minister for Maritime Transport and Railways on 16 June 1917, but resigned on 14 May 1918. He held various other ministerial positions and was a member of the board of directors of some banks and other bodies.
He died in Turin on 4 November 1936 at the age of 82.

Leonard B. Cresswell

Leonard Baker Cresswell (July 18, 1901 – April 25, 1966) was a highly decorated officer of the United States Marine Corps with the rank of major general. He is most noted for his service as commanding officer of 1st Battalion, 1st Marines during Guadalcanal Campaign. Cresswell later served as commanding general of Troop Training Unit, Atlantic Fleet and completed his career as Director of the Staff of the Inter-American Defense Board.
Early career.
Leonard B. Cresswell was born on July 18, 1901, in Lexington, Mississippi, and attended high school in Oxford, Mississippi, before he was transferred to Tupelo Military Institute. He graduated from the institute in summer of 1919 and subsequently enrolled the Mississippi State University in Starkville, Mississippi. Cresswell graduated with bachelor's degree in summer 1924.
Cresswell was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on June 21, 1924, and ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for officer's training. He completed the school in June of the following year and was attached to Marine Corps Schools, Quantico as an instructor in Infantry Weapons School. Cresswell remained in that capacity until November of that year and then was ordered to the Marine Barrack at Norfolk Navy Yard, where served until November 1926. While there, he met his future wife, Emilia Field Belknap, daughter of Norfolk Yard Commandant, Captain Reginald R. Belknap. They were married on June 1, 1927, in Christ Church in Norfolk, Virginia.
He was subsequently attached to the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS "Pennsylvania", where he served until April 1928. Cresswell was then attached to the 4th Marine Regiment at Quantico and sailed for expeditionary duty to China in May 1929. He served three years with guard duties at Shanghai International Settlement and returned to the United States in July 1932.
Upon his return, Cresswell served with the Marine barracks at Brooklyn Navy Yard until May 1933, when he was ordered for Senior Course back to the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico. He then served as an instructor at the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard until May 1939, when he was appointed commanding officer of the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS "Maryland". Cresswell was stationed at Hawaii and took part in the several patrol cruises along the West Coast.
World War II.
At the beginning of July 1941, Cresswell was promoted to the rank of major and transferred to the staff of 1st Marine Division as adjutant to commanding general, Philip H. Torrey. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, division began with the preparation for deployment to South Pacific and got the new division commander, Major General Alexander Vandegrift in March 1942.
Cresswell was subsequently promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and appointed commanding officer of 1st Battalion, 1st Marines under Colonel Clifton B. Cates. The 1st Marine Division deployed to South Pacific in June 1942 and remained on New Zealand for few weeks, before moved to Koro Island, Fiji to rehearse for Guadalcanal Operation.
The 1st Marines landed on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942, and captured nearby airfield during the first day. During the night on August 21, Japanese troops launched a counteroffensive and attacked 2nd Battalion positions between Ilu and Tenaru rivers. Although dense jungle and difficult terrain made it impossible for the tanks assigned to his command to effect a crossing of the river, Lieutenant Colonel Cresswell advanced with his battalion to the other side of the Tenaru and, by the skillful disposal of his men over a large area, attacked the rear of enemy's regiment, succeeded in annihilating the Japanese force between the Ilu and the Tenaru Rivers with a minimum loss to his unit. The Japanese lost almost 770 soldiers killed in action as they attempted to cross the Tenaru River to gain control of the vital Henderson Airfield. Cresswell was decorated with the Navy Cross for his service on Tenaru.
First Marine Division was ordered to Australia for rest and refit in December 1942, and Cresswell was appointed executive officer of 5th Marine Regiment under Colonel John T. Selden in January 1943. His tour of duty in the Pacific ended in September of that year, when he was ordered back to the United States. His old superior, Clifton B. Cates, who was meanwhile promoted to the rank of brigadier general and now served as commandant of the Marine Corps Schools Quantico, requested for Cresswell to be attached to his staff.
Cresswell was subsequently appointed commander of the Reserve Officers School, which trained and sent to combat duty all newly commissioned Marine Corps Reserve officers. He served in that capacity until January 1945, when he was appointed commander of Platoon Leaders School. Cresswell also took part in the training of officers of the Royal Netherlands Marine Brigade and received Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau, rank Commander.
In May 1945, Cresswell returned to the Pacific Area and assumed command of 23rd Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division again under General Clifton B. Cates. However regiment did not see combat anymore and Cresswell served on Maui, Hawaii until the end of war. During October 1945, 23rd Marines relocated to Camp Pendleton, where they were disbanded during the following month.
Later career.
Cresswell was subsequently ordered to Guam and appointed planning and ground forces operations officer on the staff of the commander, Marianas, U. S. Pacific Fleet. He returned to the United States in August 1947 and assumed duty as commanding officer of Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. and director of Marine Corps Institute. He left Washington in July 1949 in order to attend the Senior Course at Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.
Following his graduation in July 1950, Cresswell was transferred to Camp Lejeune and appointed chief of staff, 2nd Marine Division under Major General Ray A. Robinson. However, the division did not go overseas and remained at Camp Lejeune as combat readiness force. Cresswell was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in July 1951 and appointed 2nd Division assistant commander under his old friend from Guadalcanal, Edwin A. Pollock.
During this time he was given temporary additional duty in command of a joint air-ground brigade which he organized and with which he executed a training maneuver of two months duration in the West Indies Area, culminating in a full-scale amphibious assault on the Onslow Beach Area.
Cresswell was detached from 2nd Marine Division in June 1952 and ordered to Naval Station Norfolk for duty as commanding general of Troop Training Unit, Atlantic Fleet. He participated in the amphibious training of personnel from all branches of the United States Military until July 1954. Cresswell was then ordered to Washington, where he succeeded Brigadier General William S. Fellers as Director of the Staff of the Inter-American Defense Board. In this capacity, he took part in the development of collaborative approaches on common defense and security issues facing countries in North, Central, and South America.
He retired from the Marine Corps on June 30, 1956, after 32 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of major general for having been specially commended in combat. Major General Leonard B. Cresswell died on April 25, 1966, in Annapolis, Maryland, and was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. He was survived by wife Emilia and daughters May, Emilia and Julia. The housing building at his Alma mater, Mississippi State University was name in his honor – Cresswell Hall.

Mersereau Ring

The Mersereau Ring, a spy ring operating throughout the New Brunswick and New York regions during the American Revolution, began gathering intelligence on British military activity for General George Washington as early as December 1776. While retreating through New Brunswick, Washington set up the Mersereau Ring through businessman and patriot Joshua Mersereau. According to their initial arrangements, Joshua's eldest son John LaGrange Mersereau was to remain in New Brunswick after American forces retreated. By 1777, the Mersereau Ring expanded into a greater intelligence network operating under Colonel Elias Dayton of the 1st New Jersey Militia.
Joshua Mersereau.
Joshua Mersereau (1728-1804) attended Kings College, practiced law in New York City, and operated a stage coach line with his brother John prior to the Revolutionary War. As the revolution approached, the brothers offered their horses for American military service and in 1775 Joshua helped rally troops for a military expedition into Quebec. During the Revolutionary War, Joshua served as a Representative for Richmond County with the Provincial Assembly of New York State.
In addition to his political responsibilities, Joshua served as Deputy Commissary of prisoners under General Elias Boudinot for Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. In this role, Joshua corresponded frequently with George Washington about prisoners of war and intelligence matters. Joshua and the Mersereau family, owning a tavern on Staten Island and a stagecoach line between New York and Philadelphia, had the covert means for transporting intelligence reports through their legitimate businesses.
In 1780, Joshua Mersereau received a promotion to the rank of Major. Joshua continued to serve in his role as Deputy Commissary until the conclusion of the war, upon which he moved his family to Tioga County and became a surrogate judge.
John LaGrange Mersereau.
Once American forces retreated across the Delaware River in 1776, John LaGrange (1760-1841) moved from New Brunswick to Staten Island and later Manhattan where he gathered intelligence from behind British lines. Due to weakness in his right arm, John LaGrange was unable to carry a musket so he assumed this intelligence role to aid the American forces. Joshua's apprentice, John Parker, served as the first courier between John LaGrange and the American forces and completed at least three trips across enemy lines. Parker was eventually caught by the British and died shortly thereafter in prison, prompting John LaGrange to assume responsibilities as both agent and courier. When serving as courier himself, John LaGrange used a large stone at Shooter's Island as a dead drop between New Jersey and Staten Island to pick up instructions and drop off intelligence reports. As precaution, John LaGrange would tow the reports in a bottle tied to his raft, thus allowing him to dispose of the incriminating evidence in the event British forces intercepted his raft. Light signals along the river served as indicators for when reports were ready for pick-up on Shooter’s Island.
After 18 months of espionage behind British lines, the British finally began to suspect John LaGrange, prompting the agent to rejoin American forces in Rutland, MA. Once back with American forces, John LaGrange served as a Deputy Commissary of imprisoned British troops for the remainder of the conflict, caring for troops from General John Burgoyne's army. In order to maintain the flow of information coming from this network after John LaGrange's role was compromised, the Mersereau Ring received assistance from additional Mersereau family members. John LaGrange's brother Joshua used a skiff to go to Staten Island where he would pick up copies of the "Register" that Paul Mersereau would leave in the cellar of his house.
After the war, John LaGrange became a county clerk for Richmond County in Staten Island. John LaGrange was later appointed surrogate judge for Tioga County in 1791 and for Chenango County in 1798.
John Mersereau.
The elder John Mersereau (1731-1820), brother of Joshua and uncle of John LaGrange, oversaw a smaller network within the ring with at least six intelligence agents. These agents typically identified themselves in reports by their initials and consequently most of their identities are unknown yet suspected. The only known agent from this network is Paul Latourette, while the identities of "Amicus Reipublicae" and "A Stranger" remain unknown. The suspected identities of other agents include the same Culper Ring informant John Cork under the alias "J.C.", John Meeker or one of the Mersereaus under the alias "J.M.", and Asher Fitz Randolph under the alias "A.R." For his role in the Revolutionary War, the British had proclaimed the elder John a "Rebel" and offered five hundred guineas to anyone who could turn him in dead or alive.
Accomplishments.
The earliest intelligence success for the Mersereau Ring occurred in December 1776 when Joshua and John LaGrange discovered evidence that the British prepared to pursue the retreating Continental Army across the Delaware River. The British intentionally sunk boats with the purpose of floating them to transport troops across the Delaware; however, the Mersereaus discovered the boats and removed them, allowing the Continental Army to escape without pursuit.
The Mersereau Ring played a role in the capture of British Major John André, ultimately exposing the betrayal of American General Benedict Arnold. An agent from the Mersereau Ring warned Major Benjamin Tallmadge about alleged plans for Major André, under a false name, to meet with General Arnold as the two plotted the surrender of West Point to the British. Major Tallmadge, as intelligence chief for George Washington, had unknowingly granted a safe conduct pass for a "John Anderson", Major André's alias, at the request of General Arnold. However, when Major Tallmadge was informed that an American outpost under Lieutenant John Jameson had arrested a British officer with documents discussing the surrender of West Point, he realized Major André's true identity and had him arrested.

Rustia gens

The gens Rustia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned toward the end of the Republic, and a few of them achieved prominence in imperial times, with Titus Rustius Nummius Gallus attaining the consulship under Tiberius in AD 34.
Origin.
The nomen "Rustius" seems to belong to a class of gentilicia of Umbrian derivation., and one of the Rustii held high office at Interamnia Nahars in Umbria. The nomen "Rusius", found in a handful of authors and inscriptions, may be an error for "Rustius", as may "Ruscius", although the latter may have been a variant of "Roscius".
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Rustii were "Lucius" and "Titus", both of which were among the most common names throughout Roman history. There are also instances of "Gaius", "Marcus" and "Quintus", also very common names.
Branches and cognomina.
The only distinct family of the Rustii bore the surname "Caepio", from "caepa", an onion, one of a large class of cognomina derived from the names of familiar objects, plants, and animals. Members of this family appear in history for about two hundred years, from the first century BC to the second century AD. "Gallus", used by one of the family, referred either to a cockerel, or a Gaul.

He has established himself as a traditionalist Catholic, critical of innovations which he considers discordant with the Church's tradition and consistent teaching.
In 2015, Sire published "Phoenix from the Ashes: The Making, Unmaking, and Restoration of Catholic Tradition", a highly critical approach to the Second Vatican Council and its effects on the Catholic Church, in which he concludes: "The fact needs to be clearly stated: the Second Vatican Council was a betrayal of the Church's faith. Its consequences cannot be put right until that betrayal has been recognized and reversed."
In 2017, under the pen-name "Marcantonio Colonna", Sire published (initially as a self-publication) a book entitled "The Dictator Pope", in which he criticized the pontificate of Pope Francis. Sire revealed his authorship in March 2018, one month before the publication of the revised and updated English edition, resulting in his suspension from the Order of Malta. On November 19, 2018, Fra’ Giacomo Dalla Torre, the Grand Master of the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta, issued a decree expelling Sire. However, Sire plans to appeal this decision.

Pwera Usog

Pwera Usog is a 2017 Philippine horror thriller film directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It was produced under Regal Entertainment.
Production.
"Pwera Usog" was directed by Jason Paul Laxamana’ under the film studio, Regal Entertainment. The members of the cast of "Pwera Usog" was selected by Regal Entertainment rather than Laxamana. Laxamana, whose first horror film was "Pwera Usog", says it is a challenge directing a film belonging to the horror genre and mentioned how there must be a proper build up before executing the "moment of horror". He directed the film in the premise on how to startle people who have seen horror films and other scary videos online.
The film's theme is centered on "usog" an affliction in Filipino superstition associated with being greeted by a stranger. "Pwera Usog" was targeted towards a young demographic particularly the "urban millennial". Laxamana incorporated technology and social media, as well as used a cast composed of mainly millennial to connect with the target demographic and introduce to them the concept of "usog" without alienating them.
Laxamana described the direction of the film as deviating from Asian horror-type of films the Philippine audience is used to which employs shock and surprise tactics and promise the audience of more "action scenes" which he says will surprise viewers but leave them laughing at themselves at their own reactions. The director said he was also inspired from a "side" of him for the directorial decision of adding "disgusting scenes" to "Pwera Usog" and narrated on how he liked to scare his family and friends as a child by describing scenarios that will make them grossed out or uncomfortable.
Release.
"Pwera Usog" was among the three films Regal Entertainment planned to submit as an entry at the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival.

David Melville (inventor)

David Melville (March 21, 1773 - September 3, 1856) was an American inventor, credited with the first gas street lighting in America, and the first American patent for gas lighting.
Melville was born in Newport, Rhode Island to David and Mary (West) Melville. He was apparently able to light both his house and his street with gas by 1805-1806, using hydrogenous gas made by burning coal and wood. In 1876 the American Gas Light Journal stated that "in 1806 he had so far succeeded that he was enabled to light more than twenty rooms on his premises; by means of a large lantern he lighted Pelham street as it had never been lighted before." In 1916, Walton Clark stated:
He maintained the lights in his home until 1817. His feat was considerably ahead of the commercial gas industry, as gas lighting began regular service in Newport in 1853, nearly fifty years after Melville's demonstrations.
Melville was granted the first American gas light patent on March 24, 1810, and a subsequent patent on March 18, 1813, but neither is still extant as the U.S. Patent Office and all its records and models were destroyed by fire on December 15, 1836. (Like all U.S. patents before 1836, they were unnumbered.) A drawing and detailed description of Melville's Improved Gas Apparatus, presumably reflecting the 1813 patent, may be seen in an 1814 letter from Benjamin Silliman, Professor of Chemistry at Yale College, to David Melville, Patentee of the Improved Gas Apparatus, as recorded in "The Journal of Foreign Medical Science and Literature". Likewise, both the diagram and text of the second patent are included in Thomas Cooper's book, published in 1816. This apparatus produced gas from coal. Its description states that about 40 pounds of coal would produce enough gas for 3 hours of lighting at a brightness equivalent to 50 candles.
Melville married Patience S. Sherman (1791-1880) on March 4, 1812, and had six children. Late in that year, he hired the brass founders Otis Chaffee and Joseph Lyon to make gas machinery and ornamental fixtures. After partnering with Captain Winslow Lewis, de facto "Superintendent for lighting the United States light houses," they began manufacturing gas equipment in Boston. By June 5, 1813, an advertisement indicated that gas lights had been installed at a cotton factory in Watertown, Massachusetts, apparently with Melville's equipment. On November 13, 1813, a second installation was completed in the Wenscott Manufacturing Co.'s factory near Providence, Rhode Island. A later installation, at the Arkwright Mill near Providence exploded, destroying a small out-building and killing the watchman.
In 1817, Melville received a one year contract from the U.S. Government for a trial of gas in the Beavertail Lighthouse near Newport, but lobbying from whale oil suppliers killed the contract after one year. From 1824-1835, he served as weigher and gauger in the custom-house at Newport, but was removed from that office for political reasons by the new Collector of Customs, William Littlefield.
Ultimately, Melville's work was not a commercial success.

Ida Pellet

Ida Pellet (1838 - 10 July 1863) was a German classical actress, originally from the Austrian lands, who died young.
Life.
Ida Pellet was probably born in Graz. Reference is also made to sources giving her place of birth as Lemberg or Linz, and it was to Linz where her father, Joseph Pellet, having retired from a successful career as a theatre director in a succession of cities, had retired in order to focus on preparing his daughter for her own stage career. Thanks to her father she was able to make her theatre debut at Nuremberg in 1853, while still a child. She appeared at Linz in 1954, and there were also early appearances at the Carltheater in Vienna.
She spent the next four years at the Stettin Theatre where she worked under the artistic direction of Edgar Hein, especially in respect of conversation pieces, and quickly became a favourite with audiences. In the first part of 1858 she signed up with the Court Theatre in Wiesbaden where for the next three years she concentrated on tragic roles. In November 1859, Lina Fuhr retired from the Berlin Hofbühne Theatre and married an Eye Doctor. In Summer 1860, Ida Pellet made her first appearance at the Hofbühne, at this stage as a guest performer and a competitor for the vacancy left by Miss Fuhr who had been the theatre company's leading tragic heroine. Pellet's successes in "The Maid of Orleans" and other popular classics of the time secured for her a place in the company with effect from September 1861. Other noteworthy performances were as Maria Stuart, Leonore, Gretchen, Jane Eyre, Lorle and Anne Liese, along with Chriemhilde in Hebbel's and Marfa in Heigel's eponymous drama-tragedy.
In Summer 1826 Pellet travelled to Prague for a series of guest performances. In the middle to June she moved on to Leipzig where on 20 June she opened in "The Widow of Lowood" (a drama based on Jane Eyre). She appeared in the same piece each night till 26 June. On 28 June she was due to open in "The Maid of Orleans" and took part in the morning rehearsal. Her appearance that evening was cancelled on account of her sickness, however, and she would never return from her sickbed. Twelve days later, despite attentive nursing in the , she died.

Abteiland

The Abteiland ("Abbey Land") is a former estate owned by Niedernburg Abbey above Passau. From the early 13th century until the seizure of church property under Napoleon in 1803, the region belonged to the "Hochstift" or Prince-Bishopric of Passau with the prince bishop as its secular and spiritual head. The region lies in the Bavarian Forest north of the River Danube and east of the River Ilz. It was crossed by a historical trade route, the Goldener Steig ("Golden Trail"). Its main settlement was Waldkirchen, which was granted wide-ranging rights by the prince bishops of Passau.
The Abteiland has great significance as a cultural landscape rich in species and habitats and is viewed as a refugium for endangered plants and animals. Together with the Neuburg Forest it forms natural region no. 408 - the Passau Abteiland and Neuburg Forest - within the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest.
In April 2011, the Abteiland Working Group was formed from the following eleven municipalities:
History.
The Bavarian Forest north of Passau was settled in a first wave in the 9th/10th century. According to a (not wholly authenticated) document, in the year 1010 King Henry II (emperor from 1014) gifted large areas north of the Danube to convent of Niedernburg in Passau. The name "Abteiland" is still used today for the former estate of the monastery between the rivers Danube, Ilz and Rodl and the border ridge. In the early 13th century, the region came to the Bishopric of Passau. In the late Middle Ages, the area of influence of the Passau magnates and prelates extended as far as the present Mühlviertel in Austria. Waldkirchen played a special role in the Abteiland. With the first written confirmation of market rights in 1285, Waldkirchen was also received its own jurisdiction from the prince bishop of Passau, which was the lowest level of legal authority. There used to be a pillory on the market place, "Waldkirchner Marktplatz".
The market town judge was appointed by the prince-bishop and had performed functions like that of a mayor. He performed his duties along with six council members. At the annual "E'haft" ("Ehehaft" = 'sitting', from the Germanic "Ewa" or "Eha" = law) meeting, legal, police and municipal matters were dealt with. All citizens and residents (non-citizens) had to participate.
Traditions.
Every year in July in Waldkirchen, the Market Judge Days ("Marktrichtertage") are held as a traditional event. They recall the time when the market was still a part of the Prince Bishopric of Passau.
